THE LONG HISTORY OF RESPONSES TO COASTAL CHANGE CAN BE LINKED TO THE HISTORY OF COASTAL ENGINEERING, THE WIDER DEVELOPMENT OF COASTAL MANAGEMENT; AND MOST RECENTLY SHORELINE MANAGEMENT, AS A POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING FLOOD AND EROSION RISKS ON CHANGING COASTS. COASTAL CHANGE IS ONGOING AND LONG TERM SO THAT MANAGEMENT IS NECESSARILY A PROCESS AND EFFECTIVE DELIVERY REQUIRES AN ADEQUATE MONITORING PROGRAMME TO INFORM MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. MONITORING ALSO ENABLES ADAPTIVE AND FLEXIBLE SOLUTIONS TO BE IMPLEMENTED THAT TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES SUCH AS FUTURE CLIMATE, PROMOTING WELL ADAPTED RATHER THAN MAL ADAPTED OUTCOMES. GIVEN THE CURRENT CONCERNS ABOUT ACCELERATED RATES OF SEA LEVEL RISE AND CLIMATE CHANGE THIS PAPER CONSIDERS THE DEVELOPMENT OF BOTH SHORELINE MANAGEMENT AND THE SUPPORTING NATIONAL MONITORING PROGRAMME IN ENGLAND TO ASSESS WHETHER THE SMP PROCESS REMAINS USEFUL IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE LESSONS AND EXPERIENCE ARE WIDELY TRANSFERABLE. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

IN TERMS OF INTEGRATED COASTAL/OCEAN PROCESSES MODELING, TWO CASE STUDIES ARE PRESENTED: THE FIRST ONE IS TO PREDICT FLOODING/INUNDATION AND EROSION IN A SMALL SCALE ESTUARY IN TAIWAN INDUCED BY A SET OF SLR SCENARIOS AND LOCAL EXTREME HYDROLOGICAL FORCING, WHICH INCLUDES WAVES, TIDES, RIVER FLOODS, AND SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; THE SECOND CASE AIMS AT SIMULATING LARGE SCALE HYDRODYNAMIC RESPONSES (I.E. WAVES AND STORM SURGES) TO SLR AND A HURRICANE IN A REGION SCALE DOMAIN COVERING THE NORTHERN GULF COAST. THE MODEL IS VALIDATED BY SIMULATING WAVES, STORM SURGES AND MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES BY USING LOCAL HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. PREDICTION RESULTS SHOW THAT THE VARIATIONS OF WATER SURFACE ELEVATIONS, WAVES, AND MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES ARE GENERALLY NOT LINEARLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE STATIC SLR; THE RATES OF THEIR VARIABLE CHANGES ARE VARYING WITH LOCATION AND TOPOGRAPHY/BATHYMETRY. TO DEAL WITH NONLINEAR FEATURES IN UNSTEADY AND MULTISCALE HYDRODYNAMIC AND MORPHODYNAMIC PROCESSES IN COASTS AND OCEANS, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ADOPT THIS INTEGRATED PROCESS MODELING APPROACH FOR COASTAL HAZARD MANAGEMENT IN RESPONSE TO LOCAL SLR.

RESULTS REVEALED THAT ALL THE MEASURED HEAVY METALS, EXCEPT ZN, IN THE SEDIMENTS HAD LOWER CONCENTRATIONS THAN IN OTHER NEARBY ESTUARIES. ONLY ZN MAY BE OF CONCERN FOR POTENTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON ESTUARINE BIOTA IN THE STUDY AREA. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF FE, ALL THE STUDIED HEAVY METALS SHOWED SEASONAL VARIATION, BUT THE PATTERNS WERE DIVERSE. ORGANIC MATTER AND THE CLAY FRACTION IN SEDIMENTS WERE GOOD SINKS FOR HEAVY METALS, EXCLUDING ZN, WHILE FE AND MN WERE GOOD CATCHERS. PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS SUGGESTED THAT ZN MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT ORIGINS AND/OR MECHANISMS OF TRANSPORT, ACCUMULATION AND CIRCULATION, COMPARED WITH THE OTHER HEAVY METALS STUDIED. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF SOURCES AND THE BEHAVIOR OF ZN WOULD ENHANCE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE ESTUARY MANAGEMENT PLAN IN THIS STUDY AREA.	***

BOTH PLANTS AND MICROALGAE COME FROM THE SAME WETLAND, A RECENTLY RESTORED AREA IN ALBUFERA DE VALENCIA NATURAL PARK (SPAIN). THE NEED TO REPLANT THE AREA UNDER RESTORATION WITH SUBMERGED MACROPHYTES MAKES THIS INFORMATION ESSENTIAL FOR WETLAND MANAGEMENT. THE SELECTION AND CULTURE OF THE SUBMERGED MACROPHYTES USED IN THAT RESTORATION (FOUR CHAROPHYTES: CHARA HISPIDA, CHARA VULGARIS, CHARA BALTICA, NITELLA HYALINA, AND ONE ANGIOSPERM: MYRIOPHYLLUM SPICATUM) PROVIDED A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO TEST IN THE LABORATORY THE ALLELOPATHIC EFFECT OF MACROPHYTE ASSEMBLAGES ON ENVIRONMENTAL PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES. THREE EXPERIMENTS WERE CARRIED OUT USING SPRING COMMUNITIES: IN EXPERIMENT 1, A DIVERSE PHYTOPLANKTON ASSEMBLAGE (29% OF BIOMASS CHLOROPHYCEAE, 26% CRYPTOPHYCEAE, 19% DIATOMS AND 9% CYANOBACTERIA) WAS CULTIVATED WITH EXUDATES FROM MONOCULTURES OF C. HISPIDA, N. HYALINA AND M. SPICATUM. EXPERIMENT 2 PROVED THE ALLELOPATHIC EFFECT OF A MACROPHYTE ASSEMBLAGE EXUDATE (C. HISPIDA, C. BALTICA, C. VULGARIS, N. HYALINA AND M. SPICATUM IN A MIXED CULTURE) ON TWO DIFFERENT PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES (ONE DIVERSE: 53% BIOMASS OF DIATOMS, 27% CYANOBACTERIA, 18% CHLOROPHYTES AND ANOTHER DOMINATED BY SMALL CHLOROPHYTES). THE RESPONSE VARIABLES WERE CHL A CONCENTRATION, PHYTOPLANKTON BIOVOLUME AND MAIN ALGAL GROUPS BIOVOLUMES. WHEN PHYTOPLANKTON GREW IN WATER WITH EXUDATES FROM MONOCULTURES, MICROALGAL BIOMASS WAS FROM 4 TO 6 TIMES LOWER THAN IN THE CONTROL AFTER 5 DAYS AND CHL A CONCENTRATION WAS UP TO 4 TIMES LOWER. THE INHIBITORY EFFECT OF C. HISPIDA WAS GREATER THAN THAT OF M. SPICATUM. MIXED MACROPHYTE ASSEMBLAGES RESULTED IN EVEN STRONGER ALLELOPATHIC EFFECTS THAN MONOCULTURED MACROPHYTES; THE BIOMASS WAS REDUCED BY 7 FOLD AFTER 5 DAYS USING THE MIXED EXUDATES AND CHL A CONCENTRATION WAS BETWEEN 3 AND 5 TIMES LOWER. THE EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATE THAT MACROPHYTES ARE PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN INHIBITING THE GROWTH OF BOTH SMALL DIATOMS AND THE LEAST DESIRABLE PHYTOPLANKTON COMPONENT IN THESE WETLANDS (FILAMENTOUS CYANOBACTERIA), BUT NOT CHLOROPHYTES (REDUCTION BY 37 69, 7 14 AND 1 7 FOLD FOR DIATOMS, CYANOBACTERIA AND CHLOROPHYTES, RESPECTIVELY). THE PREDICTIONS ARE THAT SPRING MACROPHYTES MIGHT ENHANCE MICROALGAE THAT ARE SUITABLE FOR GRAZING (MOSTLY SMALL CHLOROPHYTES) AND WILL DECREASE NON EDIBLE FILAMENTOUS TAXA. THUS, RESTORATION MANAGERS SHOULD REPLANT WITH THE MIXTURE OF SUBMERGED NATIVE MACROPHYTES THAT PROVIDE THE MOST HARMFUL ALLELOPATHIC EFFECTS TO PROMOTE BENEFITS ON AQUATIC COMMUNITIES IN TWO SYNERGISTIC WAYS: BY DIRECTLY REDUCING MICROALGAL BIOMASS AND BY INDIRECTLY ENHANCING GRAZING, WHICH IN TURN, WOULD PROMOTE A CLEAR WATER PHASE. WE PRESENT REPLANTED MACROPHYTES AS ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS, I.E. ORGANISMS THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY MODULATE THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES FOR THE WETLAND FOOD WEBS, BY CAUSING CHANGES IN PRIMARY PRODUCER ASSEMBLAGES. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER B.V.

THE BYPASS SYSTEM FUNCTIONS BY INTAKING WATER FROM UPSTREAM OF THE RESERVOIR AND TRANSFERRING IT TO THE RESERVOIR SELECTIVE WITHDRAWAL TOWER IN ORDER TO AVOID TURBID WATER WITHDRAWAL. THE MODEL WAS CALIBRATED USING DATA MEASURED IN 2009. SIMULATED RESULTS OF WATER TEMPERATURE, DISSOLVED OXYGEN, TURBIDITY, NUTRIENTS AND FOUR GROUPS OF PHYTOPLANKTON (CYANOBACTERIA, DIATOMS, CHLOROPHYTES AND CRYPTOPHYTES) WERE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH FIELD MEASUREMENTS. SOME BYPASS OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS AND MODEL PARAMETER TEST SCENARIOS WERE PERFORMED. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE BYPASS OPERATION ALTERED THE NUTRIENT LOAD AND IN RESERVOIR CONCENTRATIONS AS WELL AS THE HEAT BUDGET, WHICH CHANGED THE WATER TEMPERATURE, DISSOLVED OXYGEN AND OTHER WATER QUALITY PARAMETERS, INCLUDING CHLOROPHYLL A (CHLA) CONCENTRATION IN THE RESERVOIR. DETAILED EXAMINATION OF THE GROWTH OF PHYTOPLANKTON REVEALED THAT CYANOBACTERIA WERE MOST AFFECTED BY THE BYPASS OPERATION BECAUSE OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE CHANGE OF HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND THE BUOYANCY CONTROL OF CELLS. THE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT THE OPERATION OF THE BYPASS SYSTEM WAS USEFUL IN DECREASING INFLOW NUTRIENT LOADS AS WELL AS DECREASING THE TRANSPORT OF THE ALGAL BIOMASS FROM UPSTREAM TO THE DAM WALL, WHICH GENERALLY HELPED TO DECREASE THE MAGNITUDE OF ALGAL BIOMASS NEAR THE OFFTAKE REGION OF THE RESERVOIR.

THE REAL GENETIC ALGORITHM HAS BEEN USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH PROVEN AND ACCEPTED FINITE DIFFERENCE ANALYSIS TO REACH AN EFFICIENT SOLUTION. IT ALSO ILLUSTRATES THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE REAL GA OPTIMIZER AND THE FINITE DIFFERENCE TECHNIQUE. TWO SCENARIOS REGARDING THE WELL POSITIONS, NUMBER OF WELLS, PUMPING RATE AT EACH WELL, AND TOTAL COST WERE DETERMINED FOR THE PURPOSE. A NEW SYSTEM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED FOR REMOVING HEAVY METALS [MERCURY (HG) AND CADMIUM (CD)] FROM GROUNDWATER IN A REAL PROBLEM AND PROVED TO BE OPTIMAL. REAL CODING GAS PROVED TO BE A PRACTICAL MEANS OF OPTIMIZING ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS RELATED TO GROUNDWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT, IN PARTICULAR THOSE INVOLVING DISCONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS. THE REAL GA CAN BE USED WITH ACCREDITED FINITE DIFFERENCE METHODS TOWARD AN OPTIMAL SOLUTION. THE DEVELOPED APPLICATION OF A COMBINED SIMULATION OPTIMIZATION METHOD FOR CLEANUP OF CONTAMINATION FROM A REAL LANDFILL IN A COASTAL AREA OF SYRIA CAN ALSO BE USED IN OTHER WATER RESOURCE QUALITY APPLICATIONS.

A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE GEOLOGIC AND HYDROLOGIC CONTROLS ON THESE FLUXES IS CRITICAL FOR THEIR ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT. WE EXAMINED GEOLOGIC FEATURES, POREWATER SALINITY, AND SGD RATES AND PATTERNS AT AN ESTUARINE STUDY SITE. SEISMIC DATA SHOWED THE EXISTENCE OF PALEOVALLEYS INFILLED WITH ESTUARINE MUD AND PEAT THAT EXTEND HUNDREDS OF METERS OFFSHORE. A LOW SALINITY GROUNDWATER PLUME BENEATH THIS LOW PERMEABILITY FILL WAS MAPPED WITH CONTINUOUS RESISTIVITY PROFILING. EXTENSIVE DIRECT SGD MEASUREMENTS WITH SEEPAGE METERS (N 551) SHOWED FRESH GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE PATTERNS THAT CORRELATED WELL WITH SHALLOW POREWATER SALINITY AND THE HYDROGEOPHYSICAL FRAMEWORK. SMALL SCALE VARIABILITY IN FRESH AND SALINE DISCHARGE INDICATES INFLUENCE OF METER SCALE GEOLOGIC HETEROGENEITY, WHILE SITE SCALE DISCHARGE PATTERNS ARE EVIDENCE OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE PALEOVALLEY FEATURE. BENEATH THE PALEOVALLEY FILL, FRESH GROUNDWATER FLOWS OFFSHORE AND MIXES WITH SALTWATER BEFORE DISCHARGING ALONG PALEOVALLEY FLANKS. ON THE ADJACENT DROWNED INTERFLUVE WHERE LOW PERMEABILITY FILL IS ABSENT, FRESH GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE IS FOCUSED AT THE SHORELINE. SHALLOW SALTWATER EXCHANGE WAS GREATEST ACROSS SANDY SEDIMENTS AND WHERE FRESH SGD WAS LOW. THE GEOLOGIC CONTROL OF GROUNDWATER FLOWPATHS AND DISCHARGE SALINITY DEMONSTRATED IN THIS WORK ARE LIKELY TO AFFECT GEOCHEMICAL REACTIONS AND THE CHEMICAL LOADS DELIVERED BY SGD TO COASTAL SURFACE WATERS. BECAUSE SIMILAR PROCESSES ARE LIKELY TO EXIST IN OTHER ESTUARIES WHERE DROWNED PALEOVALLEYS COMMONLY CROSS MODERN SHORELINES, THE EXISTENCE AND IMPLICATIONS OF COMPLEX HYDROGEOLOGY ARE IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS FOR STUDIES OF GROUNDWATER FLUXES AND RELATED MANAGEMENT DECISIONS.

THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO BUILD AN INTEGRATED MODELING FORECASTING SYSTEM FOR RAINFALL RUNOFF EROSION THAT ASSESSES PLANS FOR WATER AVAILABILITY AND SEDIMENT YIELD THAT CAN BE CONCEIVED AND IMPLEMENTED. IN THIS WORK, WE PRESENT AN EVALUATION OF AN INTEGRATED MODELING SYSTEM FOR A BASIN LOCATED IN THIS REGION WITH A RELATIVELY LOW PREDICTABILITY OF SEASONAL RAINFALL AND A SMALL AREA (600 KM(2)).

THE RAINFALL ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT: (1) THE DYNAMIC DOWNSCALING CARRIED OUT BY THE REGIONAL RSM MODEL APPROXIMATES THE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF THE DAILY OBSERVED DATA SET ALTHOUGH ERRORS WERE DETECTED IN THE MAGNITUDE AND TIMING (ANTICIPATION OF PEAKS, FOR EXAMPLE) AT THE DAILY SCALE, (2) AN UNBIASED PRECIPITATION FORECAST SEEMED TO BE ESSENTIAL FOR USE OF THE RESULTS IN HYDROLOGICAL MODELS, AND (3) THE INFORMATION DIRECTLY EXTRACTED FROM THE GLOBAL MODEL MAY ALSO BE USEFUL. THE SIMULATED RUNOFF AND RESERVOIR STORED VOLUMES ARE STRONGLY LINKED TO RAINFALL, AND THEIR ESTIMATION ACCURACY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AT THE MONTHLY SCALE, THUS RENDERING THE RESULTS USEFUL FOR MANAGEMENT PURPOSES.

MANAGEMENT OF FORESTED UPLANDS FOR LOWER BASAL AREA, CURRENTLY A PRIORITY FOR HABITAT IMPROVEMENT ON PUBLIC LANDS, MAY ALSO INCREASE WATER YIELD THROUGH DECREASED EVAPOTRANSPIRATION (ET). TO EXPLORE THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE SYNTHESIZED STUDIES OF PRECIPITATION AND ET IN COASTAL PLAIN PINE STANDS TO DEVELOP A STATISTICAL MODEL OF WATER YIELD AS A FUNCTION OF MANAGEMENT STRATEGY, STAND STRUCTURE, AND ECOSYSTEM WATER USE. THIS MODEL ALLOWED US TO ESTIMATE CHANGES IN WATER YIELD IN RESPONSE TO VARYING MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ACROSS SPATIAL SCALES FROM THE INDIVIDUAL STAND TO A REGIONAL WATERSHED. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SLASH PINE STANDS MANAGED AT LOWER BASAL AREAS CAN HAVE UP TO 64% MORE CUMULATIVE WATER YIELD OVER A 25 YEAR ROTATION COMPARED TO SYSTEMS MANAGED FOR HIGH DENSITY TIMBER PRODUCTION, WITH THE GREATEST INCREASES IN STANDS ALSO MANAGED FOR RECURRENT UNDERSTORY FIRE. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE IMPORTANT UNCERTAINTIES IN THE MAGNITUDE OF ADDITIONAL WATER YIELD AND ITS FINAL DESTINATION (I.E., SURFACE WATER BODIES VS. GROUNDWATER), THIS ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS THE POTENTIAL FOR MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ON PUBLIC AND PRIVATE TIMBER LANDS TO PARTIALLY OFFSET INCREASING DEMAND ON SURFACE AND GROUNDWATER RESOURCES.	***

THESE FACILITIES THEMSELVES ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO SERVICE DISRUPTIONS DURING OR AFTER THE EMERGENCY. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A RELIABLE EMERGENCY FACILITY LOCATION MODEL THAT DETERMINES BOTH PRE EMERGENCY FACILITY LOCATION PLANNING AND THE EVACUATION OPERATIONS AFTERWARDS, WHILE FACILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF DISRUPTIONS. WE ANALYZE HOW EVACUATION RESOURCE AVAILABILITY LEVERAGES INDIVIDUAL EVACUEES RESPONSE TO SERVICE DISRUPTIONS, AND SHOW HOW EQUILIBRIUM OF THE EVACUEE ARRIVAL PROCESS COULD BE REACHED AT A FUNCTIONING PICK UP FACILITY. BASED ON THIS EQUILIBRIUM, AN OPTIMAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION STRATEGY IS FOUND TO BALANCE THE TRADEOFF BETWEEN THE EVACUEES RISKS AND THE EVACUATION AGENCYS OPERATION COSTS. THIS LEADS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPACT POLYNOMIAL SIZE LINEAR INTEGER PROGRAMMING FORMULATION THAT MINIMIZES THE TOTAL EXPECTED SYSTEM COST FROM BOTH PRE EMERGENCY PLANNING (E.G., FACILITY SET UP) AND THE EVACUATION OPERATIONS (E.G., FLEET MANAGEMENT, TRANSPORTATION, AND EXPOSURE TO HAZARDOUS SURROUNDINGS) ACROSS AN EXPONENTIAL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE DISRUPTION SCENARIOS. WE ALSO SHOW HOW THE MODEL CAN BE FLEXIBLY USED TO PLAN NOT ONLY PRE DISASTER EVACUATION BUT ALSO POST DISASTER RESCUE ACTIONS. NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS AND AN EMPIRICAL CASE STUDY FOR THREE COASTAL CITIES IN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI (BILOXI, GULFPORT, AND DIBERVILLE) ARE CONDUCTED TO STUDY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED MODELS AND TO DRAW MANAGERIAL INSIGHTS.

POSSIBLE FLOOD HAZARD SOURCES ARE NOT ONLY THE MANY RIVERS WHICH PASS THROUGH THE FLEMISH INLAND, BUT ALSO THE NORTH SEA, WHICH IS SENSITIVE TO THE PREDICTED SEA LEVEL RISE AND WHICH CAN AFFECT LARGE PARTS OF THE FLEMISH COASTAL AREA. DUE TO THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN FLOOD RISKS IN THE 21ST CENTURY, THE FLEMISH GOVERNMENT HAS CHANGED ITS FLOOD MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FROM A FLOOD CONTROL APPROACH TO A RISK BASED APPROACH. INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON PROTECTION AGAINST A CERTAIN WATER LEVEL, THE OBJECTIVE NOW IS TO ASSURE PROTECTION AGAINST THE CONSEQUENCES OF A FLOOD, WHILE CONSIDERING ITS PROBABILITY. IN THE FIRST PART, ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THE REASONING AND FUNCTIONING OF THE RISK BASED APPROACH. RECENT IMPROVEMENTS TO THE APPROACH ARE DISCUSSED, AS WELL AS THE GIS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ENTIRE MODEL. THE FUNCTIONING OF THE APPROACH IS SUBSEQUENTLY DEMONSTRATED IN TWO CASE STUDIES. THE SECOND PART OF THE PAPER DISCUSSES FUTURE CHALLENGES FOR THE FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT IN FLANDERS. THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THESE CHALLENGES IS THE EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE ON THE ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF FLOOD RISKS, WHICH ENTERED INTO FORCE IN 2007. THE FLEMISH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIRECTIVE IS DISCUSSED AND SITUATED IN THE EUROPEAN LANDSCAPE. FINALLY, ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THE COMMUNICATION OF FLOOD RISKS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC, SINCE THE AVAILABILITY OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT PLANS IS AMONG THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE EU FLOODS DIRECTIVE.	***

THIS STUDY AIMS TO QUANTIFY DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF AIP IN CHINA, TO DEVELOP APPROACHES THAT MEASURE THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS, AND TO IDENTIFY AREAS THAT ARE AT HIGHER RISK OF PLANT INVASION. BASED ON PUBLISHED LITERATURE, THERE WERE 384 AIPS IN CHINA, REPRESENTING 233 GENERA FROM 66 FAMILIES. CLIMATIC FACTORS WERE AMONG THE PRIMARY FACTORS DETERMINING AIPS OVERALL DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS. THE MAJORITY OF AIPS WERE TROPICALLY DISTRIBUTED IN CHINA, MEANING THAT THEY WERE MAINLY RESTRICTED TO SOUTHERN CHINA. TEMPERATE DISTRIBUTED AIPS, THOSE DISTRIBUTED ONLY OR PREDOMINANTLY IN NORTHERN CHINA, WERE FEWER BUT HAD HIGHER AVERAGE RATES OF SPREAD THAN TROPICALLY DISTRIBUTED AIPS. AVERAGE ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT PER AIP WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH AIP RICHNESS, MEANING THAT AREAS WITH RELATIVELY FEW AIPS NEVERTHELESS HAVE SOME OF THE MOST DETRIMENTAL ONES. OUR COMPARATIVE EVALUATION SHOWED THAT THE RISK OF INVASION DIFFERED AMONG REGIONS OF CHINA, WITH HIGH RISK AREAS IN SOUTHERN CHINA (YUNNAN, GUANGXI, AND GUANGDONG) AND CENTRAL COASTAL AREAS OF EASTERN CHINA (SHANDONG, HEBEI, AND JIANGSU). IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, AREAS AROUND LATITUDES OF 33 DEGREES N, INCLUDING HEBEI, SHANDONG, HENAN, AND JIANGSU, SHOULD BE GIVEN MORE ATTENTION FOR THE CONTROL AND PREVENTION OF PLANT INVASIONS. PREDICTIONS OF HIGH RISK AREAS FOR FUTURE INVASIONS DIFFERED DEPENDING ON THE SCALE OF AGGREGATION AND THE EVALUATION INDEX, INDICATING THAT INVASIVE RISK ASSESSMENTS SHOULD BE BASED ON MULTIPLE FACTORS.	***

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF FINITE DIFFERENCE BASED NUMERICAL MODEL MODFLOW AND THE ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN) MODEL DEVELOPED IN THIS STUDY IN SIMULATING GROUNDWATER LEVELS IN AN ALLUVIAL AQUIFER SYSTEM. CALIBRATION OF THE MODFLOW WAS DONE BY USING WEEKLY GROUNDWATER LEVEL DATA OF 2 YEARS AND 4 MONTHS (FEBRUARY 2004 TO MAY 2006) AND VALIDATION OF THE MODEL WAS DONE USING I YEAR OF GROUNDWATER LEVEL DATA (JUNE 2006 TO MAY 2007). CALIBRATION OF THE MODEL WAS PERFORMED BY A COMBINATION OF TRIAL AND ERROR METHOD AND AUTOMATED CALIBRATION CODE PEST WITH A MEAN RMSE (ROOT MEAN SQUARED ERROR) VALUE OF 0.62 M AND A MEAN NSE (NASH SUTCLIFFE EFFICIENCY) VALUE OF 0.915. GROUNDWATER LEVELS AT 18 OBSERVATION WELLS WERE SIMULATED FOR THE VALIDATION PERIOD. MOREOVER, ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK MODELS WERE DEVELOPED TO PREDICT GROUNDWATER LEVELS IN 18 OBSERVATION WELLS IN THE BASIN ONE TIME STEP (I.E., WEEK) AHEAD. THE INPUTS TO THE ANN MODEL CONSISTED OF WEEKLY RAINFALL, EVAPORATION, RIVER STAGE, WATER LEVEL IN THE DRAIN, PUMPING RATE OF THE TUBEWELLS AND GROUNDWATER LEVELS IN THESE WELLS AT THE PREVIOUS TIME STEP. THE TIME PERIODS USED IN THE MODFLOW WERE ALSO CONSIDERED FOR THE TRAINING AND TESTING OF THE DEVELOPED ANN MODELS. OUT OF THE 174 DATA SETS, 122 DATA SETS WERE USED FOR TRAINING AND 52 DATA SETS WERE USED FOR TESTING. THE SIMULATED GROUNDWATER LEVELS BY MODFLOW AND ANN MODEL WERE COMPARED WITH THE OBSERVED GROUNDWATER LEVELS.

RECENT OCCURRENCES OF THE EXTREME CLIMATIC EVENTS IN THIS BASIN UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF EVALUATING THE TREND AND VARIABILITY OF HYDROCLIMATIC VARIABLES IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF FUTURE CHANGE. IN THIS STUDY, THE MONTHLY STREAMFLOW DATA FOR THE PERIOD 1972 2007 AND THE DAILY RAINFALL DATA FOR THE PERIOD 1972 2005 HAVE BEEN ANALYZED USING THE MANN KENDALL NONPARAMETRIC TEST AFTER REMOVING SERIAL CORRELATION. THE RESULTS REVEAL A SUBSTANTIAL SPATIAL AND SUBSEASONAL DIFFERENCE IN THE MONSOON SEASON STREAMFLOW AND RAINFALL PATTERNS, WITH A PREDOMINANCE OF THE INCREASING TRENDS IN JUNE AND DECREASING TRENDS IN AUGUST. HOWEVER, A MARKED INCREASE IS OBSERVED IN THE STREAMFLOW AND RAINFALL OF THE PRE AND POST MONSOON SEASON. THE CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS SHOW A DIRECT CORRESPONDENCE OF THE RAINFALL AND STREAMFLOW SERIES WITH THE EL NINO SOUTHERN OSCILLATION (ENSO), WHICH IS CONTRARY TO THE ESTABLISHED INVERSE RELATIONSHIP OVER INDIA. THE NOTEWORTHY FEATURE OF THIS STUDY IS THE OBSERVED CLIMATE UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF LARGE VARIABILITY IN THE EXTREME INDICES SINCE THE 1990S, CONSISTENT WITH THE WARMING INDUCED INTENSIFICATION OF THE HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE. STRONG EVIDENCES HAVE EMERGED REGARDING THE BASIN WIDE INCREASES IN EXTREME RAINFALL INDICES. IN PARTICULAR, THE COASTAL SECTOR OF THE BASIN IS MORE VULNERABLE TO THE HEAVY RAINFALL, WHEREAS THE SOUTHERN EASTERN GHATS REGION IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE MOISTURE STRESS. THE DISCHARGE AT THE BASIN OUTLET HAS DECLINED AT A RATE OF 3388 X 106 M(3) DECADE( 1), SUGGESTING THE NEED OF ENVIRONMENTAL FLOW ASSESSMENT. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY WOULD HELP THE RESERVOIR MANAGERS AND POLICY MAKERS IN PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT OF WATER RESOURCES OF THE MAHANADI RIVER BASIN. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER B.V.

IN THIS STUDY, A UNIQUE AND SIMPLE TECHNIQUE WAS EVOLVED IN WHICH A LINEAR PROGRAMMING (LP) OPTIMIZATION MODEL WAS FIRST DEVELOPED THAT ALLOCATES AVAILABLE LAND AND WATER RESOURCES IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE NET ANNUAL RETURNS BY MITIGATING THE WATERLOGGING PROBLEMS. A FINITE DIFFERENCE TWO DIMENSIONAL SIMULATION MODEL WAS THEN USED TO EVALUATE THE LONG TERM IMPACTS OF VARIOUS WATER MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ON THE GROUNDWATER TABLE WITH THE OPTIMAL LAND AND WATER USE PARAMETERS WHICH WERE OBTAINED THROUGH THE OPTIMIZATION MODEL. THE MODEL WAS USED TO COMBAT THE WATERLOGGING AND SALINITY PROBLEM OF AN AREA LOCATED IN HARYANA STATE OF INDIA. THE CALIBRATION, VALIDATION, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, AND ERROR ANALYSIS OF THE MODEL WAS PERFORMED BEFORE IT WAS USED TO STUDY THE IMPACT OF VARIOUS WATER MANAGEMENT SCENARIOS ON THE LONG TERM GROUNDWATER LEVEL. BASED ON THE MODEL RESULTS A CHANGE IN CROPPING PATTERN WITH REDUCED RICE AREA IS SUGGESTED. GROUNDWATER WITHDRAWAL SHOULD BE INCREASED BY 1 7 % IN THE VARIOUS NODES.

THE WATER IS EXTRACTED FROM A CARBONATE AQUIFER WITH HIGH PERMEABILITY DUE TO FRACTURING AND KARSTIFICATION THAT IS ALSO EXPLOITED FOR IRRIGATION PURPOSES AND DOMESTIC USE. SUCH EXPLOITATION HAS LED TO THE DEGRADATION OF GROUNDWATER QUALITY, PRODUCING CONFLICT AMONG THE DIFFERENT USERS. THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE AQUIFER ALLOWED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A 3D FINITE ELEMENT DENSITY DEPENDENT NUMERICAL MODEL USING THE FEFLOW CODE. THE SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE FRESHWATER BUDGET IN THE VERY HUMID HYDROLOGIC YEAR OF 2004 2005 REVEALED THAT THE AQUIFER WAS OVEREXPLOITED, ESPECIALLY DUE TO THE EXTRACTION OF FRESHWATER (ALONG WITH SEAWATER) FROM FISH FARM WELLS AND PUMPING FROM PUBLIC SUPPLY WELLS. THE MODEL WAS ALSO USED TO FORECAST THE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVOLUTION OF RESOURCES OVER TIME, THUS TESTING THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESES. RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF THE AQUIFER MOSTLY DEPENDS ON WITHDRAWALS FROM PUBLIC SUPPLY WELLS; THE QUANTITY EXTRACTED BY FISH FARMS ONLY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS THE FRESHWATER/SALTWATER INTERFACE AND, LOCALLY, THE SALINITY OF GROUNDWATER.

ELEVATED NITROGEN LEVELS IN THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER WATER RESULT IN NUTRIENT LOADING TO THESE COASTAL MARSH SYSTEMS AND CONSEQUENTLY TO THE COASTAL OCEAN. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL NITRATE REMOVAL RATES FOR TWO DIFFERENT SUBSTRATES. BAYOU SEDIMENTS REPRESENT THE LOW FLOW CONDITIONS, WHEN THE WATER IS CONSTRAINED WITHIN THE CANALS WITH HIGH POTENTIAL FOR TRANSPORT TO THE COASTAL OCEAN. THE MARSH SOIL REPRESENTS THE HIGH FLOW DIVERSION EVENTS WHEN FLOOD WATER INUNDATES UP INTO THE MARSHES. WE SOUGHT TO REMOVE THE PLANT EFFECT BY USING CORES CONTAINING BAYOU SEDIMENT AND MARSH SOIL, REMOVING ALL ROOTS AND FLOODING WITH A WATER COLUMN CONTAINING 2 MG NO3 N L 1. WATER COLUMN NITRATE AND AMMONIUM CONCENTRATION WERE MONITORED OVER 9 D.

A COMPARISON OF NITRATE REDUCTION RATES IN VEGETATED AND NON VEGETATED MARSH SOILS INDICATED THAT THE RATE OF DENITRIFICATION INCREASED TENFOLD IN VEGETATED SOILS. THIS INCREASE COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE PLANT EFFECT. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT OPERATING DIVERSIONS ON THE HIGH FLOW END OF THE SPECTRUM WOULD PROMOTE NITRATE DELIVERY OVER THE VEGETATED MARSH RATHER THAN FLOWING ONLY THROUGH CANALS. FLOODING OF THE VEGETATED MARSH MAXIMIZES THE POTENTIAL FOR REMOVAL OF RIVERINE NITRATE AND LIMITS DELIVERY OF NITRATE TO THE COASTAL OCEAN, THEREBY MITIGATING EXPRESSIONS OF EUTROPHICATION INCLUDING ALGAL BLOOMS AND HYPOXIA.

THE MODEL IS APPLIED TO TWO CONTRASTING SCOTTISH INLETS, BUT CAN POTENTIALLY BE APPLIED TO A WIDE RANGE OF STRATIFIED INSHORE WATER BODIES. THE MODEL REPRESENTS THE VERTICAL STRUCTURE OF THE INLET USING UP TO THREE HORIZONTALLY UNIFORM LAYERS, REPRESENTING SURFACE, INTERMEDIATE AND DEEP BASIN WATER RESPECTIVELY, AND CALCULATES THE DAILY VOLUME, THICKNESS, SALINITY AND TEMPERATURE OF EACH LAYER OVER AN ANNUAL CYCLE. THE MODEL IS FORCED BY OBSERVED TIME SERIES OF DAILY MEAN WIND STRESS, RIVER DISCHARGE, SURFACE HEAT FLUX, AND DEPTH PROFILES OF THE EXTERNAL COASTAL TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY. ADVECTIVE AND DIFFUSIVE FLUXES BETWEEN THE LAYERS, AND BETWEEN THE INLET AND ADJACENT COASTAL OCEAN, ARE CALCULATED FROM PARAMETERISATIONS OF KNOWN PHYSICAL PROCESSES IN INSHORE STRATIFIED WATERS, UTILISING PUBLISHED ANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS AND EMPIRICALLY BASED FORMULAE. THE GOAL IS FOR THE MODEL TO BE GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO RRES TO SUPPORT IMPROVED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. AS SUCH, THE NUMBER OF FREE PARAMETERS WITHIN THE MODEL HAS BEEN KEPT TO A MINIMUM. THE MODEL PREDICTIONS OF LAYER TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY ARE QUANTITATIVELY COMPARED TO OBSERVATIONS FROM YEAR LONG SAMPLING PROGRAMMES IN TWO CONTRASTING SCOTTISH INLETS, LOCH CRERAN AND LOCH ETIVE. THE MODEL SHOWED GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE OBSERVED DATA, REPRODUCING THE BROAD SCALE SEASONAL CYCLE AND OTHER SHORTER TERM FLUCTUATIONS. RMS ERRORS FOR TEMPERATURE WERE LESS THAN 1 DEGREES C, AND FOR SALINITY TYPICALLY OF THE ORDER 1. THE MODEL RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LOCH CRERAN BEHAVED AS A WELL MIXED BOX, WITH WEAK STRATIFICATION MAINTAINED BY STRONG VERTICAL DIFFUSION, AND VOLUME EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE INLET AND COASTAL WATERS DOMINATED BY TIDAL FORCING. IN CONTRAST, LOCH ETIVE EXHIBITED CLASSICAL FJORDIC THREE LAYER HYDROGRAPHY AND DYNAMICS, WITH STRONG STRATIFICATION, WEAK VERTICAL DIFFUSION AND A DENSITY DRIVEN CIRCULATION COMPARABLE IN STRENGTH TO TIDAL EXCHANGE. THE EFFECTS OF A DEEP WATER RENEWAL EVENT ON WATER PROPERTIES WERE SUCCESSFULLY REPRODUCED BY THE MODEL. THE POTENTIAL FOR WIDER APPLICATION OF THE MODEL TO RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ISSUES AND TO OTHER TYPES OF RRE IS DISCUSSED. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

THEREFORE, TO MINIMIZE FLOOD EXTREMES, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONTROL THE FLOOD PEAKS AT THE UPSTREAM AREA THROUGH SUITABLE WATERSHED MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. THE FLOOD CONTROL MANAGEMENT AT THE WATERSHED SCALE REQUIRES GOOD QUALITY FLOOD DATA. HOWEVER, IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES LIKE BANGLADESH, SUCH HYDROLOGICAL INFORMATION IS RARELY AVAILABLE AT THE WATERSHED LEVEL. UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS IMPORTANT TO USE A HYDROLOGICAL MODEL REPRESENTING THE RAINFALL RUNOFF PROCESS TO ARRIVE AT THE EXTREME FLOWS IN THE RIVERS, WHICH REQUIRE EXTREME RAINFALL DATA AS A MAJOR INFLOW TO THE HYDROLOGIC SYSTEM. FURTHERMORE, THE DENSITY OF RAIN GAUGES IN BANGLADESH IS LOW AND THE QUALITY OF AVAILABLE FLOOD DATA IS POOR. CONSIDERING THIS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP REGIONAL EXTREME RAINFALL MAPS FOR THE RELIABLE ESTIMATION OF FLOOD FLOWS IN THE RIVER BY USING A SUITABLE MODELING APPROACH. THEREFORE, IN THE PRESENT PAPER, AN ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO DERIVE THE REGIONAL BEST FIT EXTREME RAINFALL PATTERN FOR BANGLADESH FOR THE ESTIMATION OF EXTREME RAINFALL QUANTILES. THIS STUDY USES THE ANNUAL MAXIMUM DAILY RAINFALL OF 68 RAIN GAUGE STATIONS. AN AUTOCORRELATION TEST IS APPLIED TO TEST THE INDEPENDENCY OF THE DATA. LATER, CONSIDERING THE HETEROGENEITY IN THE HYDROCLIMATIC AND TOPOGRAPHIC DETAILS, ENTIRE RAIN GAUGE STATIONS HAVE BEEN CLUSTERED INTO SIX HYDROCLIMATICALLY HOMOGENEOUS REGIONS; NAMELY, NORTHEAST (NE), NORTHWEST (NW), SOUTHEAST (SE), SOUTHWEST (SW), COASTAL, AND CENTRAL REGIONS, BY USING THE K MEAN CLUSTERING TECHNIQUE. THE STATIONS THAT DID NOT PASS THE DISCORDANT AND HETEROGENEITY TEST WERE DISCARDED FROM THE REGIONAL FREQUENCY ANALYSIS. FOR REGIONAL FREQUENCY ANALYSIS, THE L MOMENT METHOD WAS APPLIED. BASED ON THE Z(DIST) GOODNESS OF FIT TEST AND THE L MOMENT RATIO DIAGRAM, THE GENERALIZED EXTREME VALUES DISTRIBUTION WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE BEST FIT FOR THE SE, NW, AND COASTAL REGIONS. HOWEVER, FOR NE, CENTRAL, SW REGIONS, THE BEST FIT DISTRIBUTIONS WERE GENERALIZED LOGISTIC AND GENERALIZED PARETO, RESPECTIVELY. USING THE DERIVED DISTRIBUTIONS, REGIONAL EXTREME RAINFALL QUANTILES WERE ESTIMATED, FOLLOWED BY GEO MAPPING IN ARCGIS 9.2. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943 5584.0000663.

THIS FRAMEWORK HAS TWO FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENTS. THE FIRST IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SURROGATE MODEL FOR THE RAPID EVALUATION OF HURRICANE WAVES, WATER LEVELS, AND RUN UP BASED ON A SMALL NUMBER OF PARAMETERS DESCRIBING EACH HURRICANE: HURRICANE LANDFALL LOCATION AND HEADING, CENTRAL PRESSURE, FORWARD SPEED, AND RADIUS OF MAXIMUM WINDS. THIS SURROGATE MODEL IS DEVELOPED USING A RESPONSE SURFACE METHODOLOGY FED BY INFORMATION FROM HUNDREDS OF PRECOMPUTED, HIGH RESOLUTION SIMULATING WAVES NEARSHORE (SWAN) 1 ADVANCED CIRCULATION MODEL FOR OCEANIC, COASTAL AND ESTUARINE WATERS (ADCIRC) AND ONE DIMENSIONAL BOUSSINESQ MODEL (BOUSS 1D) RUNS. FORA SPECIFIC SET OF HURRICANE PARAMETERS (I.E., A SPECIFIC LANDFALLING HURRICANE), THE SURROGATE MODEL IS ABLE TO EVALUATE THE MAXIMUM WAVE HEIGHT, WATER LEVEL, AND RUN UP DURING THE STORM AT A COST THAT IS MORE THAN SEVEN ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE LESS THAN THE HIGH FIDELITY MODELS AND THUS MEETS TIME CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY EMERGENCY MANAGERS AND DECISION MAKERS. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THIS FRAMEWORK IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE PARAMETERS USED TO CHARACTERIZE THE HURRICANE THROUGH APPROPRIATE PROBABILITY MODELS, WHICH THEN LEADS TO QUANTIFICATION OF HURRICANE RISK IN TERMS OF A PROBABILISTIC INTEGRAL. THIS INTEGRAL IS THEN EFFICIENTLY COMPUTED USING THE ALREADY ESTABLISHED SURROGATE MODEL BY ANALYZING THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS (BASED ON THE AFOREMENTIONED PROBABILISTIC DESCRIPTION). THIS ALLOWS THE RAPID COMPUTATION OF, FOR EXAMPLE, THE STORM SURGE THAT MIGHT BE EXCEEDED 10% OF THE TIME BASED ON HURRICANE PARAMETERS AT 48 H FROM LANDFALL. FINALLY, BY LEVERAGING THE COMPUTATIONAL SIMPLICITY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE SURROGATE MODEL, A SIMPLE STAND ALONE PC BASED RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL IS DEVELOPED THAT ALLOWS NONEXPERT END USERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FULL POTENTIAL OF THE FRAMEWORK. THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK ULTIMATELY FACILITATES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RAPID ASSESSMENT TOOL FOR REAL TIME IMPLEMENTATION BUT REQUIRES A CONSIDERABLE UPFRONT COMPUTATIONAL COST TO PRODUCE HIGH FIDELITY MODEL RESULTS. AS AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE, IMPLEMENTATION OF HURRICANE RISK ESTIMATION FOR THE ISLAND OF OAHU IN HAWAII IS PRESENTED; RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE VERSATILITY OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH FOR DELIVERING ACCURATE TOOLS FOR REAL TIME HURRICANE RISK ESTIMATION THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO CROSS OVER TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION BARRIERS.

CONTOUR MAPS INCORPORATING FACTOR SCORES SHOWED THAT PHENANTHRENE AND PYRENE OF PAHS HAD THE HIGHEST CONTENT AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE NORTHERN SIDE OF THE LAGOON. BENZO(A) PYRENE HAD THE HIGHEST CONTENT LOCATED IN THE MIDSECTION OF THE KAOPING RIVER AND IN DAPENG BAY.

SUSTAINABILITY IS A PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPT AND THUS DIFFICULT TO MEASURE. YET, WE NEED TO DESCRIBE IT ON RATHER PRECISE TERMS TO ASSESS WHETHER OUR WATER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE SUSTAINABLE AND TO ENSURE SUSTAINABILITY IN DECISION MAKING FOR MANAGEMENT. TO THIS END, A NUMBER OF SUSTAINABILITY CRITERIA HAVE BEEN DEFINED, BASED ON QUANTIFIABLE MEASURES, WITHOUT OVERLOOKING IMMEASURABLE ASPECTS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. THIS PAPER CONSIDERS ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL DIMENSIONS OF SUSTAINABILITY AS THE BASIC CRITERIA TO BE PURSUED IN EVALUATING HOW EFFECTIVE OUR WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS ARE IN ACHIEVING SUSTAINABILITY. ON THE OTHER HAND, ACTUAL CASE STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO TEST THE USEFULNESS OF SELECTED CRITERIA BY USING COMPUTER BASED INTERACTIVE OPTIMIZATION AND SIMULATION MODELS WITH ASSOCIATED DATABASES EMBEDDED INTO A DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM (DSS). THE STUDY HEREIN INTENDS TO PRESENT SUCH A CASE STUDY BASED ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA TO ASSESS SUSTAINABILITY IN MANAGEMENT OF THE GEDIZ RIVER BASIN IN TURKEY. VARIOUS MANAGEMENT SCENARIOS DEVELOPED FOR THE BASIN ARE EVALUATED WITHIN A DSS WHILE ENSURING MULTI STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT IN DEFINING THE THREE SUSTAINABILITY CRITERIA.

BEACH PROFILES WHICH HAVE BEEN MONITORED SINCE 1976 WERE USED TO ESTIMATE EXTREME BEACH EROSION AND COMPARED TO PREDICTIONS. EXAMINATION OF THE WAVE PROPAGATION ASSUMPTIONS REVOLVES AROUND TWO TYPES OF OFFSHORE TO NEARSHORE TRANSFER: EXCLUDING OR INCLUDING WAVE BREAKING AND BOTTOM FRICTION. A SECOND COMPLICATION IS WHETHER STILL WATER LEVEL VARIATIONS (OCEAN TIDE PLUS STORM SURGE) ARE INCLUDED. THE INCLUSION OF VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF WAVE PROPAGATION PROCESSES OTHER THAN SHOALING AND REFRACTION IN THE WAVE TRANSFER FUNCTION CHANGES ON THE EXTREME EROSION DISTRIBUTION TAIL THROUGH LOWERING ESTIMATES ABOVE ONE YEAR RETURN PERIOD. THIS BRINGS THE PREDICTED TAILS CLOSER TO THE OBSERVATIONS, BUT DOES NOT CAPTURE THE UPPER LIMIT OF STORM DEMAND IMPLIED BY THE EXTENSIVE BEACH PROFILE DATA SET INCLUDING WAVE BREAKING HAS A MARKED EFFECT ON PROBABILISTIC ESTIMATES OF BEACH EROSION.

HOWEVER, MUCH CARE IS STILL REQUIRED AS THE ART AND SCIENCE OF WETLAND RESTORATION IS CONSIDERED TO BE RUDIMENTARY COMPARED TO THE COMPLEXITY OF NATURAL WETLAND ENVIRONMENTS (ZEDLER, 2001). GAINING A SOUND APPRECIATION OF WETLAND HYDROLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO PREDICTING FUTURE ECOLOGICAL FUNCTION IN RESPONSE TO WETLAND RESTORATION PROJECTS (CALLAWAY, 2001). IN THIS REGARD, HYDRODYNAMIC NUMERICAL MODELS CAN BE USED TO PREDICT HYDROLOGICAL BEHAVIOUR AND WETLAND INUNDATION EXTENTS, PROVIDING THAT THE MODELS ARE AN ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION OF THE REAL WORLD ENVIRONMENT. WETLAND RESTORATION COMMENCED AT HEXHAM SWAMP, AUSTRALIA, IN 2008. FOR THE PAST 40 YEARS THIS FORMER ESTUARINE WETLAND HAS BEEN DEGRADED BY HYDROLOGICAL MODIFICATIONS RESULTING FROM THE OPERATION OF ONE WAY FLOODGATES AT ITS DOWNSTREAM END. THE RESTORATION PROJECT INVOLVES PROGRESSIVELY OPENING THE FLOODGATES AND ALLOWING SALINE TIDAL WATERS TO RE INUNDATE THE WETLAND FLATS, WHICH HAVE BECOME DOMINATED BY A VAST MONOCULTURE OF PHRAGMITES AUSTRALIS. A TUFLOW HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL OF HEXHAM SWAMP WAS DEVELOPED TO IDENTIFY AREAS WITHIN THE WETLAND LIKELY TO BE INFLUENCED BY OPENING THE FLOODGATES. THE MODELS PREDICTIVE CAPACITY WAS IMPROVED DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROJECT BY THE COLLECTION OF HIGH RESOLUTION GROUND ELEVATION DATA AND ADVANCEMENTS IN THE NUMERICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE FLOODGATES STRUCTURE. CALIBRATION OF THE NUMERICAL MODEL WAS UNDERTAKEN PROGRESSIVELY AS THE RESTORATION PROJECT ADVANCED. ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL PARAMETERS FOR MATCHING OBSERVED DATA WAS THE DEFINITION OF THE TOP OF BANK ELEVATIONS ALONG THE WETLAND CREEKBANKS. THESE ELEVATIONS DEFINE THE LEVEL AT WHICH WATER STARTS TO OVERTOP THE BANKS AND INUNDATE THE LOWER LYING WETLAND FLATS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PREDICTIVE NUMERICAL MODEL OF HEXHAM SWAMP WETLAND HAS BEEN LIMITED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF ACCURATE TOPOGRAPHIC DATA GIVEN THE DENSE VEGETATION COVERING THE MAJORITY OF THE MODEL DOMAIN. THIS HAS NECESSITATED A PRAGMATIC AND INCREMENTAL APPROACH TO WETLAND RESTORATION IN ORDER TO MANAGE RISK AND UNCERTAINTY. IT IS ENVISAGED THAT TOPOGRAPHIC DATA COLLECTION WILL BECOME EASIER OVER THE NEXT DECADE OR SO AS THE VEGETATION SLOWLY TRANSITIONS FROM ITS EXISTING TALL FRESHWATER REEDS TO LOWER PROFILE SALTMARSH COMMUNITIES AND OPEN WATER PONDS.

BY CONSIDERING AN IDEALIZED COAST, SURGE RESPONSE FUNCTIONS ARE USED WITH JOINT PROBABILITY STATISTICS TO DEFINE TIME VARYING CONTINUOUS PROBABILITY MASS FUNCTIONS FOR HURRICANE FLOOD ELEVATION. UNCERTAINTY IN THE FLOOD ESTIMATES INTRODUCED BY UNCERTAINTY IN FUTURE CLIMATE IS QUANTIFIED BY CONSIDERING VARIANCE IN FUTURE CLIMATE AND SEA LEVEL PROJECTIONS.

THE METHODOLOGY CONSIDERS DESALINIZATION OF PUMPED WATER AND INJECTION OF TREATED WATER INTO THE AQUIFER. VARIABLE DENSITY AQUIFER MODELS ARE COMPUTATIONALLY INTRACTABLE WHEN INTEGRATED IN OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS. IN ORDER TO ALLEVIATE THIS PROBLEM, A MULTI OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM IS DEVELOPED COMBINING SURROGATE MODELS BASED ON MODULAR NEURAL NETWORKS [MOSA(MNNS)]. THE SURROGATE MODELS ARE TRAINED ADAPTIVELY DURING OPTIMIZATION BASED ON A GENETIC ALGORITHM. IN THE CROSSOVER STEP, EACH PAIR OF PARENTS GENERATES A POOL OF OFFSPRING WHICH ARE EVALUATED USING THE FAST SURROGATE MODEL.

THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE NEW MOSA(MNN) ALGORITHM OFFERS SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN COMPUTATIONAL TIME COMPARED TO PREVIOUS METHODS (IN THE CASE STUDY IT REQUIRES ONLY 5% OF THE TIME REQUIRED BY OTHER METHODS). FURTHER, THE PARETO SOLUTION IS BETTER THAN THE SOLUTION OBTAINED BY ALTERNATIVE ALGORITHMS. (C) 2012 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

FOR THIS PURPOSE, AN INVENTORY OF CO, OXIDE OF NITROGEN (NOX), AND PM10 EMISSIONS WAS COUPLED WITH THE NON STEADY STATE MESOSCALE MODEL 5/CALIFORNIA PUFF DISPERSION MODELING SYSTEM TO SIMULATE INDIVIDUAL SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER SEVERAL SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES. AS THE CONTRIBUTION OF A PARTICULAR SOURCE TO GROUND LEVEL CONCENTRATIONS CAN BE EVALUATED BY SIMULATING THIS SINGLE SOURCE EMISSIONS OR OTHERWISE TOTAL EMISSIONS EXCEPT THAT SOURCE, A SET OF EMISSION SENSITIVITY SIMULATIONS WAS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE IF CALPUFF MAINTAINS A LINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMISSION RATES AND PREDICTED CONCENTRATIONS IN CASES WHERE EMITTED PLUMES OVERLAP AND CHEMICAL TRANSFORMATIONS ARE SIMULATED. SOURCE APPORTIONMENT REVEALED THAT GROUND LEVEL RELEASES (I.E., HIGHWAY AND QUARRIES) EXTENDED OVER LARGE AREAS DOMINATED THE CONTRIBUTION TO EXPOSURE LEVELS OVER ELEVATED POINT SOURCES, DESPITE THE FACT THAT CUMULATIVE EMISSIONS FROM POINT SOURCES ARE HIGHER. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT CHEMICAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF NOX ARE INSIGNIFICANT, POSSIBLY DUE TO SHORT RANGE PLUME TRANSPORT, WITH CALPUFF EXHIBITING A LINEAR RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN EMISSION RATE. THE CURRENT PAPER POINTS TO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF GROUND LEVEL EMISSIONS IN CONTRIBUTING TO URBAN AIR POLLUTION EXPOSURE AND QUESTIONS THE VIABILITY OF THE PREVAILING PARADIGM OF POINT SOURCE EMISSION REDUCTION, ESPECIALLY THAT THE INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENT IN AIR QUALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS COMMON ABATEMENT STRATEGY MAY NOT ACCOMPLISH THE DESIRABLE BENEFIT IN TERMS OF LOWER EXPOSURE WITH COSTLY EMISSIONS CAPPING. IMPLICATIONS: THE APPLICATION OF ATMOSPHERIC DISPERSION MODELS FOR SOURCE APPORTIONMENT HELPS IN IDENTIFYING MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO REGIONAL AIR POLLUTION. IN INDUSTRIAL URBAN AREAS WHERE MULTIPLE SOURCES WITH DIFFERENT GEOMETRY CONTRIBUTE TO EMISSIONS, GROUND LEVEL RELEASES EXTENDED OVER LARGE AREAS SUCH AS ROADS AND QUARRIES OFTEN DOMINATE THE CONTRIBUTION TO GROUND LEVEL AIR POLLUTION. INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS RELEASED AT ELEVATED STACK HEIGHTS MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DILUTION, RESULTING IN MINOR CONTRIBUTION TO EXPOSURE AT GROUND LEVEL. IN SUCH CONTEXTS, EMISSION REDUCTION, WHICH IS INVARIABLY THE ABATEMENT STRATEGY TARGETING INDUSTRIES AT A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN CONTROL EQUIPMENT OR PROCESS CHANGE, MAY RESULT IN MINIMAL RETURN ON INVESTMENT IN TERMS OF IMPROVEMENT IN AIR QUALITY AT SENSITIVE RECEPTORS.	***

THERE IS AN INCREASING CONCERN THAT THE CURRENT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR MANY COASTAL REGIONS ARE UNSUSTAINABLE UNDER CHANGING ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE CONDITIONS. SEA LEVEL RISE IS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN IN COASTAL REGIONS, AND FEW COUNTRIES HAVE PLANNED TO DEAL WITH THE EXACERBATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL DECLINE IN THE FACE OF SEA LEVEL RISE.

THIS WORK EXPLORES THE APPLICATION OF WINTER MAINTENANCE CHEMICALS WITH A LIFE CYCLE APPROACH TO UNDERSTAND WHICH ACTIONS A DOT CAN TAKE TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE LIFE CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THESE ACTIVITIES. THREE REPRESENTATIVE TREATMENTS AND/OR BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE COMPARED: CONVENTIONAL ROCK SALT, CALCIUM MAGNESIUM ACETATE (CMA), AND PREEMPTIVE TREATMENTS OF ROADWAYS WITH A BRINE OF SALT AND/OR CMA. THE RESULTS CONCLUSIVELY SHOW THAT CMA, WHICH HAS BEEN WIDELY TOUTED AS AN ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE, IF MORE EXPENSIVE, ALTERNATIVE TO CHLORIDE BASED TREATMENTS, HAS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OVER ITS ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE. MOST OF THESE BURDENS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPSTREAM PRODUCTION PROCESSES REQUIRED TO GENERATE THE CMA. THE SALT BASED TREATMENTS CONSUME CONSIDERABLY LESS WATER, ENERGY, AND GENERATE FEWER GREENHOUSE GASES AND BIOCHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND IN RECEIVING WATERS. APPLYING THE CHLORIDE CHEMICALS AS A BRINE RATHER THAN IN THE DRY FORM RESULTS IN IMPORTANT REDUCTIONS IN ALL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OVER THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE. THIS RESULT IS CONSISTENT FOR A VARIETY OF CLIMATE CONDITIONS (E.G., REPRESENTATIVE OF COASTAL, PIEDMONT, AND MOUNTAIN CLIMATES) CONSIDERED FOR THIS STUDY, WHICH USED HISTORICAL WEATHER DATA FROM VIRGINIA. BECAUSE DOTS CAN AFFECT APPRECIABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN EFFICIENCY BY USING BRINES, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES THE ACTIVITIES SPECIFICALLY RESULTING IN THE MOST IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT ON A SYSTEMS BASIS. THE DOT CONTROLLED STEPS WITH THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR IMPROVEMENT INCLUDE REDUCING THE ENERGY CONSUMED FOR THE SALT APPLICATION PROCESS AND IMPLEMENTING PRACTICES THAT REDUCE TOTAL STORM WATER RUNOFF TO REDUCE CHLORIDE LOADING.

IN THE PRESENT ANALYSIS, THE ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON WIND FARM SITING OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES COST, IN PARTICULAR ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL SERVICES, ARE EXPLORED IN AN ECOSYSTEM BASED MANAGEMENT (EBM) CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK. AN ECOLOGICAL TYPOLOGY OF THE COASTAL AREA IS DEVELOPED ON THE BASIS OF ECOLOGICAL VARIABLES, USING SPATIAL MULTIVARIATE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT AND CLUSTER ANALYSES. THEN, THE SENSITIVITY OF THE RESULTING ECOLOGICAL SUBREGIONS TO WIND FARM IMPACT IS ASSESSED THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION OF ECOLOGICAL SERVICES IMPACT INDEXES. A FISHERY SERVICE INDEX IS USED TO ASSESS THE FISHERIES SERVICES CONSTRAINTS. ECOSYSTEM SERVICES CONSTRAINTS ARE COMBINED WITH THE TECHNOLOGICAL COST AND THE WIND RESOURCES TO PROVIDE A WIND FARM SITING INDEX (WIFSI), WHICH CAN BE USED AS A TOOL TO IDENTIFY OPTIMAL AREAS FOR WIND FARM SITING. IN THE PAPER, THE AUTHORS DEVELOP THE CONCEPTUAL APPROACH AND PRESENT ITS APPLICATION TO THE SAMP AREA AS A CASE STUDY.

DOI: 10.1111/JAWR.12000 ABSTRACT: HYDROLOGIC MONITORING WAS CONDUCTED IN TWO FIRST ORDER LOWER COASTAL PLAIN WATERSHEDS IN SOUTH CAROLINA, UNITED STATES, A REGION WITH INCREASING GROWTH AND LAND USE CHANGE. STORM EVENTS OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD WERE ANALYZED FOR DIRECT RUNOFF COEFFICIENTS (ROC) AND THE TOTAL STORM RESPONSE (TSR) AS PERCENT RAINFALL. ROC CALCULATIONS UTILIZED AN EMPIRICAL HYDROGRAPH SEPARATION METHOD THAT PARTITIONED TOTAL STREAMFLOW INTO SUSTAINED BASE FLOW AND DIRECT RUNOFF COMPONENTS. ROC RATIOS RANGED FROM 0 TO 0.32 ON THE UPPER DEBIDUE CREEK (UDC) WATERSHED AND 0 TO 0.57 ON WATERSHED 80 (WS80); TSR RESULTS RANGED FROM 0 TO 0.93 AT UDC AND 0.01 TO 0.74 AT WS80. VARIABILITY IN EVENT RUNOFF GENERATION WAS ATTRIBUTED TO SEASONAL TRENDS IN WATER TABLE ELEVATION FLUCTUATION AS REGULATED BY EVAPOTRANSPIRATION. GROUNDWATER ELEVATION BREAKPOINTS FOR EACH WATERSHED WERE IDENTIFIED BASED ON ANTECEDENT WATER TABLE ELEVATION, STREAMFLOW, ROCS, AND TSRS. THESE THRESHOLDS REPRESENT THE GROUNDWATER ELEVATION ABOVE WHICH EVENT RUNOFF GENERATION INCREASED SHARPLY IN RESPONSE TO RAINFALL. FOR EFFECTIVE COASTAL LAND USE DECISION MAKING, BASELINE WATERSHED HYDROLOGY MUST BE UNDERSTOOD TO SERVE AS A BENCHMARK FOR MANAGEMENT GOALS, BASED ON BOTH SEASONAL AND EVENT BASED SURFACE AND GROUNDWATER INTERACTIONS.	***

THESE FACTORS CAN LEAD TO MAPPING ERRORS THAT CAN HAVE A DIRECT BEARING ON DERIVATIVE ANALYSES SUCH AS HYDRAULIC MODELING AND HABITAT ASSESSMENT. WE DISCUSS THE WATER AND SUBSTRATE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SITES, COMPARE THE CONVENTIONAL AND REMOTELY SENSED RIVER BED TOPOGRAPHIES, AND INVESTIGATE THE LASER WAVEFORMS REFLECTED FROM SUBMERGED TARGETS TO PROVIDE AN EVALUATION AS TO THE SUITABILITY AND ACCURACY OF THE EAARL SYSTEM AND ASSOCIATED PROCESSING ALGORITHMS FOR RIVERINE MAPPING APPLICATIONS.	***

HERE WE PRESENT A MULTI OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK FOR IMPROVING THE MANAGEMENT OF A WATER WORKS THAT OPERATES WITH INFILTRATION BASINS, INJECTION WELLS AND ABSTRACTION WELLS. THE TWO MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES ARE TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF WATER NEEDED FOR INFILTRATION AND TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF GETTING CONTAMINATED WATER INTO THE DRINKING WATER WELLS. THE MANAGEMENT IS SUBJECT TO A DAILY DEMAND FULFILMENT CONSTRAINT. TWO DIFFERENT OPTIMIZATION METHODS ARE TESTED. CONSTANT SCHEDULING WHERE DECISION VARIABLES ARE HELD CONSTANT DURING THE TIME OF OPTIMIZATION, AND SEQUENTIAL SCHEDULING WHERE THE OPTIMIZATION IS PERFORMED STEPWISE FOR DAILY TIME STEPS. THE LATTER IS DEVELOPED TO WORK IN A REAL TIME SITUATION. CASE STUDY OPTIMIZATION RESULTS ARE PRESENTED FOR THE HARDHOF WATER WORKS IN ZURICH, SWITZERLAND. IT IS FOUND THAT BOTH METHODS PERFORM BETTER THAN THE HISTORICAL MANAGEMENT. THE CONSTANT SCHEDULING PERFORMS BEST IN FAIRLY STABLE CONDITIONS, WHEREAS THE SEQUENTIAL OPTIMIZATION PERFORMS BEST IN EXTREME SITUATIONS WITH HEAVY RAINFALL OR LARGE CHANGES IN WATER DEMAND.	***

THE QUANTIFICATION OF SUCH FLOWS IS CRUCIAL INFORMATION IN THE RESTORATION AND MANAGEMENT OF GROUNDWATER DEPENDENT WETLANDS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO QUANTIFY GROUNDWATER INFLOW AT THE LEVEL OF THE HYDROGEOLOGICAL BASIN, WHICH DISCHARGES INTO THE WETLAND IN THE COASTAL PLAIN OF THE RIO DE LA PLATA (ARGENTINA). IT ALSO AIMS AT EVALUATING WHETHER SUCH INFLOW IS AFFECTED BY GROUNDWATER EXPLOITATION IN THE HIGH PLAIN ADJACENT TO THE WETLAND. ON THE BASIS OF WATER LEVEL DATA, A MODEL OF HYDROLOGICAL BEHAVIOUR WAS DEVELOPED AND THEN A NUMERICAL SIMULATION TO QUANTIFY GROUNDWATER INFLOW WAS CARRIED OUT. THE EVOLUTION OF GROUNDWATER LEVELS WAS ANALYZED CONSIDERING THREE SITUATIONS: ONE OF THEM IN NATURAL CONDITIONS AND TWO OTHERS UNDER DIFFERENT GROUNDWATER EXPLOITATION CONDITIONS. IN THE FIRST CASE, THE INFLOW ORIGINATES IN THE RECHARGE FROM PRECIPITATION, IN THE LOCAL GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE FROM THE ADJACENT HIGH PLAIN AND IN THE REGIONAL ONE FROM THE SEMI CONFINED AQUIFER. THE EXPLOITATION OF THE SEMI CONFINED AQUIFER IN THE HIGH PLAIN CAUSES THE FORMATION OF A CONE OF DEPRESSION WHICH MODIFIES THE HYDRODYNAMICS OF THE WETLAND IN THE AREA ADJACENT TO THE EXTRACTION WELLS. THE QUANTIFICATION OF FLOWS SHOWS THAT GROUNDWATER EXPLOITATION IN AREAS OF THE BASIN LOCATED OUT OF THE WETLAND MAY CAUSE THE VOLUME OF WATER FLOWING INTO THE WETLAND THROUGH GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE TO DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY 25 %. THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING DISCHARGE WETLANDS AS PART OF REGIONAL HYDROGEOLOGICAL SYSTEMS SHOULD BE HIGHLIGHTED, MAINLY AS REGARDS THE MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES.	***

CONVERSELY, BOTH APPROACHES HAVE SEVERAL IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES THAT MAKE THEM COMPLEMENTARY. FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE SDM IS MORE SUITABLE FOR SIMULATING THE FEEDBACK DYNAMICS OF PROCESSES, OOBN MODELLING IS A POWERFUL TOOL FOR MODELLING SYSTEMS WITH UNCERTAIN INPUTS (OR OUTPUTS) CHARACTERISED BY PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS. THIS COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS IS APPLIED TO THE KAIROUAN AQUIFER SYSTEM, TUNISIA, WHERE THE AQUIFER PLAYS AN ESSENTIAL ROLE FOR SOCIO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE REGION. BOTH MODELS PRODUCED COMPARABLE RESULTS USING BASELINE DATA, AND SHOW THEIR COMPLEMENTARITY THROUGH A SUITE OF SCENARIO TESTS. IT IS SHOWN THAT REDUCING PUMPING OF GROUNDWATER TO COASTAL CITIES MAY PROVE THE KEY TO REDUCING THE CURRENT AQUIFER DEFICIT, THOUGH LOCAL DEMAND REDUCTION MUST BE CONSIDERED TO PRESERVE THE AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT WATER MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE TACKLED USING BOTH APPROACHES TO COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER, ADDING DEPTH AND INSIGHT, AND GIVING A MORE COHERENT PICTURE OF THE PROBLEM BEING ADDRESSED, ALLOWING FOR ROBUST POLICY DECISIONS TO BE MADE.	***

THE REMOVAL OF APPROXIMATELY 20% OF THE TOTAL FLOOD DISCHARGE FROM THE RIVER PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF LARGE WATER DIVERSION ON THE SEDIMENT TRANSPORT CAPACITY OF LARGE RIVERS. BOAT BASED, ACOUSTIC AND WATER AND BED SAMPLING SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED IN THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER CHANNEL ADJACENT TO THE SPILLWAY IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF THE STRUCTURE, AT FULL CAPACITY, AND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING (JUNE 2011) AND 1 YEAR AFTER (JUNE 2012) CLOSURE. THE SURVEYS WERE DESIGNED TO EXAMINE (1) ELEVATION CHANGE OF THE CHANNEL BED DUE TO SCOUR OR AGGRADATION OF SEDIMENT, AND (2) SUSPENDED AND BEDLOAD TRANSPORT VARIABILITY UPRIVER AND DOWNRIVER OF THE SPILLWAY. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 9.1 MILLION TONS OF SAND WERE DEPOSITED ON THE CHANNEL BED IMMEDIATELY DOWNRIVER OF THE WATER EXIT PATHWAY AND EXTENDING AT LEAST 13 KM DOWNRIVER AT A RAPIDLY AND PROGRESSIVELY REDUCING MAGNITUDE PER RIVER KILOMETER. THE SURFICIAL DEPOSIT WAS OF FINER GRAIN SIZE THAN THE LATERAL SAND BARS IN THE CHANNEL UPRIVER OF THE STRUCTURE. WE ARGUE THE DEPOSIT WAS LARGELY DELIVERED FROM SUSPENSION DERIVED FROM THE OBSERVED DEFLATION OF LATERAL BARS UPSTREAM OF THE DIVERSION POINT, RATHER THAN FROM SAND ARRIVING FROM THE DRAINAGE BASIN. APPROXIMATELY 69% OF THE 2011 FLOOD DEPOSIT WAS REMOVED FROM THE 13 KM DOWNSTREAM REACH BETWEEN JUNE 2011 AND JUNE 2012. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE SOURCE OF THE CHANNEL DEPOSIT WAS THE REDUCTION IN STREAM POWER, AND, THUS, IN THE SEDIMENT TRANSPORT CAPACITY OF THE MISSISSIPPI, ASSOCIATED WITH THE WATER WITHDRAWAL. THE RE ENTRAINMENT OF THIS MATERIAL IN THE FOLLOWING FLOOD YEAR INDICATES THE SYSTEM RAPIDLY RE ESTABLISHES AN EQUILIBRIUM TO PRE OPENING CONDITIONS. FUTURE DIVERSIONS IN THE RIVER FOR COASTAL RESTORATION WILL HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE TO MAINTAIN A DEEP DRAFT NAVIGATION CHANNEL IN THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. (C) 2012 ELSEVIER B.V.

FIRST, TO DETERMINE INTRINSIC ORIENTATION (10) PARAMETERS OF A SMARTPHONE CAMERA, A CAMERA CALIBRATION WAS PERFORMED. THE RESULTS WERE SIMILAR OR SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN PREVIOUS STUDIES USING A NON METRIC CAMERA. 3 D COORDINATES PROVIDED BY THE ASSISTED GPS (A GPS) EMBEDDED IN THE SMARTPHONE SHOWED LOWER ACCURACY. ATTITUDES CALCULATED USING AN ACCELEROMETER AND MAGNETOMETER SHOWED 0.33 2.04 DEGREES STANDARD DEVIATION, COMPARED WITH OMEGA, PHI, AND KAPPA OF EXTRINSIC ORIENTATION (EO) PARAMETERS. ADDITIONALLY, ACCURACY (RMSE 0.681 PIXELS) OF SMARTPHONE IMAGE TRIANGULATION USING GROUND CONTROL POINTS (GCPS) WAS ABOUT EQUAL TO THE RMSE OF 0.404 PIXELS OF A METRIC CAMERA. FINALLY, ORTHO RECTIFIED IMAGES OF A TEST FIELD WERE GENERATED USING DEM FROM TERRESTRIAL LASER SCANNING AND ACQUIRED IMAGES. ADDITIONALLY, MAPPING OF A SHORELINE WAS PERFORMED USING THE ORTHO RECTIFIED IMAGES, AND A PROFILE OF A REPRESENTATIVE CROSS SHORE WAS COMPOSED. THE RESULTS DESCRIBED THE ACTUAL INTERTIDAL ZONE WELL.

THE PROPOSED PREDICTION MODEL EMPLOYS A SLIDING DATA WINDOW AS DYNAMICAL OBSERVER, AND TUNES THE STRUCTURE AND PARAMETERS OF RBF NETWORK TO ADAPT TO THE DYNAMICAL CHANGES OF TIDE. THE ALGORITHM USES ONLY SHORT PERIOD DATA AS TRAINING DATA AND GENERATES PREDICTIONS SEQUENTIALLY. HOURLY TIDAL DATA MEASURED AT SEVEN TIDAL STATIONS ON WEST COAST OF CANADA ARE USED TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SEQUENTIAL PREDICTION MODEL.

THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ATTACHES GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THE MARINE INDUSTRY AND MADE IT THE FOCAL POINT OF CHINA ECONOMY IN THE 12TH FIVE YEAR PLAN. WATER IS AN IMPORTANT MATERIAL FOR THE MARINE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY, BUT WASTEWATER DISCHARGE COULD UNDERMINE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARINE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY. INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY PROVIDES INSIGHTS FOR INDUSTRY TO REALIZE A HARMONIOUS DEVELOPMENT WITH THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS PAPER EXAMINED THE CASE OF WATER UTILIZATION PRACTICE BASED ON INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY OF THE HAI HUA GROUP (HHG) IN CHINA. THE UTILIZATION OF THREE KINDS OF WATER, I.E., UNDERGROUND BRINE, SEAWATER AND FRESHWATER IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HHG. IN THIS PAPER, THE WATER UTILIZATION PRACTICE OF THE HHG WAS DESCRIBED. THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE THREE KINDS OF WATER, THE DRIVING FORCE OF WATER UTILIZATION, AND THE CHALLENGES OF WATER UTILIZATION IN THE HHG WERE DISCUSSED. WE CONCLUDE THAT IMPLEMENTING INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY IS A PROMISING CHOICE FOR THE WATER UTILIZATION OF MARINE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY. IT COULD ALSO ACHIEVE THE COORDINATED DEVELOPMENT BETWEEN SEA FARMING AND THE MARINE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY. FOR NON RENEWABLE RESOURCE DRIVEN REGIONAL INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS, SUCH AS THE HAI HUA INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEM (HHIE) IN THIS PAPER, SEEKING A SUBSTITUTE APPROACH IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE STABLE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WHOLE INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEM. WE ALSO CONCLUDE THAT AN INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS OPERATION IS DRIVEN BY THE INTEGRATION OF MANY FACTORS, SUCH AS GOVERNMENT, MARKET, POLICY, CULTURE AND TECHNIQUE IN THIS PAPER. THIS REQUIRES US TO EXAMINE AN INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS OPERATION FROM A WIDER PERSPECTIVE, WHICH IS HELPFUL TO COMPREHENSIVELY AND SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPETUS OF AN INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEM.

FULFILLING THESE LEGALLY BINDING TARGETS REQUIRES OFTEN LARGE SCALE AND EXPENSIVE MANAGEMENT ACTIONS. THE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS ARE COMMONLY COMPARED WITH DETERMINISTIC ECOSYSTEM MODELS. HOWEVER, FROM A PRACTICAL MANAGEMENT POINT OF VIEW THE UNCERTAINTY IN MODEL PREDICTIONS AND THE PROBABILITY TO ACHIEVE THE TARGETS ARE AS ESSENTIAL AS THE POINT ESTIMATES PROVIDED BY THE DETERMINISTIC MODELS. FOR THIS REASON, WE EXTEND A DETERMINISTIC ECOSYSTEM MODEL INTO A PROBABILISTIC FORM. WE USE THE MODEL FOR PREDICTING THE PROBABILITY TO ACHIEVE THE TARGETS SET BY EUS WATER FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE (WFD) IN FINNISH COASTAL WATERS IN THE GULF OF FINLAND, ONE OF THE MOST EUTROPHICATED AREAS OF THE BALTIC SEA, UNDER ALTERNATIVE MANAGEMENT SCENARIOS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROBABILITY TO REACH THE WFD OBJECTIVES FOR TOTAL PHOSPHORUS IS GENERALLY LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 0.51 IN ALL AREAS. HOWEVER, FOR TOTAL NITROGEN THE PROBABILITY VARIES SUBSTANTIALLY AS IT IS PRACTICALLY ZERO IN THE WESTERN AREAS BUT ALMOST 0.80 OR HIGHER IN THE EASTERN AREAS. IT SEEMS THAT ESPECIALLY WITH PHOSPHORUS, INTERNATIONAL CO OPERATION IS NEEDED IN ORDER FOR FINLAND TO FULFILL THE OBJECTIVES OF THE WFD.	***

TRANSMISSION OF DIARRHEAL PATHOGENS OCCURS THROUGH SEVERAL EXPOSURE ROUTES INCLUDING DRINKING WATER AND HANDS, BUT THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF EACH ROUTE IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. USING MOLECULAR METHODS, THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT EXPOSURE ROUTES BY MEASURING ENTERIC BACTERIA (PATHOGENIC ESCHERICHIA COIL) AND VIRUSES (ROTAVIRUS, ENTEROVIRUS, ADENOVIRUS) IN HAND RINSES, STORED WATER, AND SOURCE WATERS IN BAGAMOYO, TANZANIA. VIRUSES WERE MOST FREQUENTLY FOUND ON HANDS, SUGGESTING THAT HANDS ARE IMPORTANT VECTORS FOR VIRAL ILLNESS. THE OCCURRENCE OF E. COLI VIRULENCE GENES (ECVG) WAS EQUIVALENT ACROSS ALL SAMPLE TYPES, INDICATING THAT BOTH WATER AND HANDS ARE IMPORTANT FOR BACTERIAL PATHOGEN TRANSMISSION. FECAL INDICATOR BACTERIA AND TURBIDITY WERE GOOD PREDICTORS OF ECVG, WHEREAS TURBIDITY AND HUMAN SPECIFIC BACTEROIDALES WERE GOOD PREDICTORS OF VIRUSES. ECVG WERE MORE LIKELY FOUND IN UNIMPROVED WATER SOURCES, BUT BOTH ECVG AND VIRAL GENES WERE DETECTED IN IMPROVED WATER SOURCES. ECVG WERE MORE LIKELY FOUND IN STORED WATER OF HOUSEHOLDS WITH UNIMPROVED SANITATION FACILITIES. THE RESULTS PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO THE DISTRIBUTION OF PATHOGENS IN TANZANIAN HOUSEHOLDS AND OFFER EVIDENCE THAT HAND WASHING AND IMPROVED WATER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES COULD ALLEVIATE VIRAL AND BACTERIAL DIARRHEA.	***

WATER LEVEL INCREASES ACROSS AN ENTIRE PUMPED DRAINAGE SYSTEM RESULT IN THE LARGEST SIMULATED REDUCTIONS IN INTRUSION OF SALINE GROUNDWATER, BUT THEY ARE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER ADVERSE HYDROLOGICAL IMPACTS. SIMILAR REDUCTIONS IN SALINE INFLOWS CAN BE ACHIEVED BY TARGETING THE SAME INCREASES IN DRAIN WATER LEVELS TO THOSE AREAS IN WHICH AN UNDERSTANDING OF SOILS AND DRAINS INDICATES GOOD DRAIN AQUIFER CONNECTIVITY. CHANGING POLICY PRIORITIES WILL REQUIRE LAND DRAINAGE OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT TO EVOLVE. THIS STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT REVISED WATER LEVEL MANAGEMENT REGIMES SHOULD NOT BE BASED ON OPTIMISATION AGAINST A SINGLE TARGET, SUCH AS SALINITY REDUCTION, BUT THAT ACCEPTABLE SOLUTIONS MUST BE SOUGHT WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT BALANCE THE APPORTIONMENT OF COSTS AND BENEFITS AT THE APPROPRIATE SCALE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT IMPACTS OUTSIDE OF THE IMMEDIATELY DRAINED AREA.	***

HERE WE PRESENT TWO FRAMEWORKS THAT CAN BE USED TO EFFECTIVELY CONDITION MONITOR BOTH ETHYLENE PROPYLENE DIENE MONOMER (EPDM) AND SILICONE RUBBER (SIR) COMPOSITE INSULATORS DURING THEIR LIFETIME IN SERVICE. THE FRAMEWORKS ARE TOOLS TO ASSIST ASSET MANAGEMENT DECISION MAKING. THE FIRST FRAMEWORK IS DERIVED FROM A GENERALIZED DIELECTRIC AGEING FRAMEWORK AND A MORE SPECIFIC ONE ON COMPOSITE INSULATORS THAT POINTS OUT THE ELEMENTS THAT GOVERN COMPOSITE INSULATOR MATERIALS AGEING ON POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION LINES. THE SECOND FRAMEWORK DEFINES FOUR AGED STATES IN RELATION TO THE RISK TO FAILURE THAT A COMPOSITE INSULATOR HAS IN SERVICE BEFORE ITS REPLACEMENT. PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS THAT CAN BE MEASURED IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AGEING ARE REVIEWED. THE TECHNIQUES AVAILABLE AS ENGINEERING TOOLS FOR MEASURING THESE PROPERTIES ARE INTRODUCED. THESE ARE DISTINGUISHED AS TECHNIQUES THAT CAN BE CARRIED OUT ON LINE AND OFF LINE, AND AS DESTRUCTIVE AND NON DESTRUCTIVE TESTS.

USING BARBADOS AS A CASE STUDY, THE RESEARCH CONDUCTED FIRST EXAMINED ECOSYSTEM DEGRADATION. SECOND, AN ANALYSIS OF ADAPTATION OPTIONS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AND RISING SEA LEVELS WAS UNDERTAKEN. BASED ON THE STUDY CONDUCTED, CONCLUSIONS WERE DRAWN ON THE IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES OF ADAPTATION MEASURES AND APPROACHES, AND AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. THE RESEARCH FOUND THAT HARD ENGINEERING IS HIGHLY PRIORITISED BECAUSE OF THE VULNERABILITY OF SETTLEMENTS, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND BEACHES TO EROSION. BEACH PROTECTION IN PARTICULAR RECEIVES SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION BECAUSE BEACH TOURISM IS ECONOMICALLY SIGNIFICANT. ADDITIONALLY, BEACH NOURISHMENT IS POPULAR IN ALLEVIATING EROSION. A MAJOR FINDING IS THAT REACTIVE AND STANDALONE PROTECTIVE EFFORTS ARE LESS EFFECTIVE, SO THAT HARD AND SOFT ENGINEERING MEASURES, THOUGH ECONOMICALLY COSTLY, ARE COMBINED RESPONSES. ON THE OTHER HAND, RETREAT AND RELOCATION ARE CONTROVERSIAL GIVEN LIMITED SPACE, AND ARE ECONOMICALLY AND POLITICALLY COSTLY.	***

MANAGED AQUIFER RECHARGE, TYPICALLY APPLIED TO ANNUAL HARVESTING OF WET SEASON FLOWS IN DRY CLIMATES, CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO CAPTURE, STORE AND RECOVER EPISODIC EXTREME FLOOD EVENTS IN HUMID ENVIRONMENTS.

CAPTURING PEAK FLOWS APPROXIMATELY 1 YEAR IN FOUR BY DEDICATING AROUND 200 KM(2) OF LAND TO GROUNDWATER RECHARGE WOULD REDUCE THE MAGNITUDE OF FLOODING AND SOCIO ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND GENERATE AROUND USD 250 M/YEAR IN EXPORT EARNINGS FOR SMALLHOLDER RAINFED FARMERS THROUGH DRY SEASON CASH CROPPING WITHOUT UNDULY COMPROMISING THE DEMANDS OF EXISTING WATER USERS. IT IS PROPOSED THAT FARMERS IN UPSTREAM RIPARIAN ZONES BE CO OPTED AS FLOOD HARVESTERS AND THUS CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVED FLOODWATER MANAGEMENT THROUGH SIMPLE WATER MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENABLE AGRICULTURAL LANDS TO BE PUT TO HIGHER PRODUCTIVE USE.

IN THIS STUDY, WE USE STEADY STATE, SHARP INTERFACE, ANALYTIC MODELLING TO GENERATE IDEALISED RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SEAWATER VOLUME, FRESHWATER VOLUME AND WATER LEVELS. THE APPROACH ASSUMES QUASI EQUILIBRIUM CONDITIONS, WHICH ARE EVALUATED USING A SELECTION OF TRANSIENT, DISPERSIVE SIMULATIONS. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT SEAWATER VOLUME CHANGES CAN INFLUENCE SIGNIFICANTLY COASTAL AQUIFER WATER LEVEL TRENDS, RELATIVE TO THE CORRESPONDING NON COASTAL AQUIFER SITUATION, PARTICULARLY WITHIN DEEP AQUIFERS WITH HIGH HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY AND LOW NET RECHARGE. IT IS ALSO SHOWN THAT SEAWATER VOLUME CHANGES CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF COASTAL AQUIFER WATER BALANCES, E.G., RELATIVE TO FRESHWATER DISCHARGE TO THE SEA, ESPECIALLY WITHIN DEEP AQUIFERS CHARACTERISED BY LOW HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY AND LOW FRESHWATER DISCHARGE. TRANSIENT SIMULATIONS SHOW THAT STEADY STATE CONDITIONS ARE A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION FOR A RANGE OF TRANSIENT SEAWATER INTRUSION SITUATIONS, INCLUDING TWO OF THE THREE CASES CONSIDERED IN THIS ANALYSIS. WE CONCLUDE THAT CHANGES IN SEAWATER VOLUMES SHOULD BE INCLUDED ROUTINELY IN COASTAL AQUIFER WATER BALANCES. ALSO, TEMPORAL TRENDS IN COASTAL AQUIFER WATER LEVELS MAY NOT PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE MEASURE OF FRESHWATER STORAGE TRENDS. IT FOLLOWS THAT THE ASSESSMENT OF COASTAL AQUIFER CONDITION SHOULD CONSIDER GROUNDWATER LEVELS RELATIVE TO THE HYDRAULIC HEAD IMPOSED BY THE OCEAN, ACCOUNTING FOR DENSITY EFFECTS.

DOWN DRIFT OF GROYNES, THIS IS KNOWN AS THE TERMINAL GROYNE EFFECT. FROM CASE STUDIES, THIS PAPER DETERMINES THE EFFECTS OF HUMAN INTERFERENCE ON SOFT CLIFFS, AND INVESTIGATES EXCESSIVE LAND LOSS AND LIKELY FUTURE COASTAL RESPONSE. USING 10.5 KM OF SOFT CLIFFS IN CHRISTCHURCH BAY, UK AS A STUDY REGION, A HISTORICAL SHORELINE ANALYSIS FROM THE MID 19TH CENTURY TO THE PRESENT DAY WAS UNDERTAKEN. DETAILED ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED AT THREE CASE STUDY SITES TO DETERMINE WHETHER RETREAT RATES HAD INCREASED DOWN DRIFT AFTER THE CONSTRUCTION OF PROTECTION WORKS. AFTER DEFENCE CONSTRUCTION, INCREASED RETREAT OCCURRED AT ALL THREE SITES, ALBEIT FOR ONLY A FEW HUNDRED METRES DOWN DRIFT, AS PROPAGATION WAS LIMITED OWING TO A HEADLAND OR LARGE SEDIMENT VOLUMES. SET BACKS CAN LEAD TO ARTIFICIAL HEADLAND FORMATION, MAKING THE COAST MORE CHALLENGING AND COSTLY TO DEFEND.

MIXING A SMALL QUANTITY OF SEAWATER WITH GROUNDWATER MAKES IT UNSUITABLE FOR USE AND CAN RESULT IN ABANDONMENT OF AQUIFERS. THEREFORE, SEAWATER INTRUSION SHOULD BE PREVENTED OR AT LEAST CONTROLLED TO PROTECT GROUNDWATER RESOURCES. THIS PAPER PRESENTS DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF A SIMULATION OPTIMIZATION MODEL TO CONTROL SEAWATER INTRUSION IN COASTAL AQUIFERS USING DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT SCENARIOS; ABSTRACTION OF BRACKISH WATER, RECHARGE OF FRESHWATER, AND COMBINATION OF ABSTRACTION AND RECHARGE. THE MODEL IS BASED ON THE INTEGRATION OF A GENETIC ALGORITHM OPTIMISATION TECHNIQUE AND A COUPLED TRANSIENT DENSITY DEPENDENT FINITE ELEMENT MODEL. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE MANAGEMENT SCENARIOS INCLUDE DETERMINATION OF THE OPTIMAL DEPTH, LOCATION AND ABSTRACTION/RECHARGE RATES FOR THE WELLS TO MINIMIZE THE TOTAL COSTS FOR CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION AS WELL AS SALT CONCENTRATIONS IN THE AQUIFER. THE DEVELOPED MODEL IS APPLIED TO ANALYZE THE CONTROL OF SEAWATER INTRUSION IN A HYPOTHETICAL CONFINED COASTAL AQUIFER. THE EFFICIENCIES OF THE THREE MANAGEMENT SCENARIOS ARE EXAMINED AND COMPARED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT COMBINATION OF ABSTRACTION AND RECHARGE WELLS IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN USING ABSTRACTION WELLS OR RECHARGE WELLS ALONE AS IT GIVES THE LEAST COST AND LEAST SALT CONCENTRATION IN THE AQUIFER. THE RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY WOULD BE USEFUL IN DESIGNING THE SYSTEM OF ABSTRACTION/RECHARGE WELLS TO CONTROL SEAWATER INTRUSION IN COASTAL AQUIFERS AND CAN BE APPLIED IN AREAS WHERE THERE IS A RISK OF SEAWATER INTRUSION.

RADIOCARBON DATING WAS CORRECTED ON THE BASIS OF STABLE CARBON ISOTOPE RATIOS AND HYDROCHEMICAL DATA. TWO MAIN RECHARGE PERIODS ARE RECOGNISED: (1) A RECENT RECHARGE PERIOD WITH RESIDENCE TIMES DATED TO YOUNGER THAN 1.3 KA BP, FOR THE SHALLOW AQUIFER AND SOME DEEP GROUNDWATER AQUIFERS; AND (2) A PALEORECHARGE OCCURRING DURING THE LATE PLEISTOCENE TO HOLOCENE TRANSITION (BETWEEN 6 AND 13 KA BP), FOR THE LOWER CONFINED AQUIFER. THE CLIMATIC EXCURSIONS (ARID AND HUMID PHASES) IDENTIFIED IN THIS STUDY MATCH WELL WITH THOSE IDENTIFIED FROM STUDIES OF PALEO CLIMATIC RECORDS IN TANZANIA AND EAST AFRICA. THE OXYGEN 18 AND RADIOCARBON RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE IS A POTENTIAL MIXING OF GROUNDWATER OF VARYING AGES ALONG FLOW PATHS IN THE COASTAL AQUIFER SYSTEM. THIS HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN BY REDOX PARAMETERS IN SOME OF THE DEEPER AQUIFER SAMPLES. THE DATA ALSO REVEALED THAT THERE IS RELATIVELY SIMPLE PATTERN OF LATERAL GROUNDWATER FLOW IN THE DEEPER CONFINED AQUIFER. ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE FROM THIS STUDY AND RELATED STUDIES IN PALEOLIMNOLOGY IMPROVES OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST CLIMATES. THE DATA SUGGESTS THAT THE PALEORECHARGE TO THE CONFINED AQUIFER WAS FROM INLAND UNDER WETTER CLIMATIC CONDITIONS THAN PRESENT. THEREFORE, PALEORECHARGE FROM THE ADJACENT MOUNTAIN REGIONS TO COASTAL AREA LIKE IFAKARA, MOROGORO AND UDZUNGWA MOUNTAINS COULD BE IMPORTANT PARTS OF RECHARGE AREA OF THE KIMBIJI AQUIFER. HOWEVER, THE HINTERLAND MOUNTAINS OF DAR ES SALAAM (MAINLY PUGU, MKURANGA, RUVU AND KISARAWE) COULD ALSO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN REPLENISHING THE KIMBIJI COASTAL AQUIFERS. IN CONTRAST, RECHARGE IN THE SHALLOW UNCONFINED AQUIFER IS CHARACTERIZED BY LOCAL RAINFALL AND RIVER WATER INFILTRATION. THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND, ASSESSING FINGERPRINTING OF PALEOCLIMATES IN SOUTHEASTERN COASTAL TANZANIA USING THE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION OF DEEP GROUNDWATER AQUIFERS. THE FRESHWATER RESOURCES IN THE NEOGENE AQUIFER CONTAIN PALEO GROUNDWATER AQUIFERS THAT HAVE BEEN MIXED WITH RECENTLY RECHARGED FLOW SYSTEMS. HENCE, THE RESOURCES MAY BE SUSTAINABLE. THIS STUDY ALSO PROVIDES INFORMATION THAT MAY BE USEFUL FOR DESIGNING OPTIMUM STRATEGIES FOR A SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF GROUNDWATER RESOURCES IN THE COASTAL AQUIFER, AND IT TESTIFIES TO THE IMPORTANCE OF GROUNDWATER AS A PALEOCLIMATIC ARCHIVE.

WITH FORCED DRAFT, THE HYDRAULIC HEAD OF A BASAL AQUIFER WOULD DECLINE AND THE SHARP INTERFACE WOULD MOVE UP. IT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM OF SEAWATER INTRUSION AS HUGE AMOUNTS OF FRESHWATER STORAGE IS REPLACED BY SALTWATER. ALSO, WITH FORCED DRAFT, THE SHARP INTERFACE IS REPLACED BY A TRANSITION ZONE IN WHICH THE SALINITY INCREASES DOWNWARD FROM FRESHWATER TO SALTWATER. AS PUMPING CONTINUES, THE TRANSITION ZONE EXPANDS. THE DESIRABLE SOURCE WATER SALINITY IN HAWAII IS ABOUT 2% OF THE SEAWATER SALINITY. THEREFORE, THE TRANSITION ZONE EXPANSION IS ANOTHER SERIOUS PROBLEM OF SEAWATER INTRUSION.

UNDER THE PRESSURES OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THE COASTAL ZONE OF GUYANA IS PROGRESSIVELY BEING TRANSFORMED INTO AGRICULTURAL LAND AND AQUACULTURE ESTATES, PROTECTED BY COASTAL DIKES. THESE HARD COASTAL DEFENCE STRUCTURES, CONSTRUCTED IN RECENT YEARS, ARE LESS EFFECTIVE IN DISSIPATING WAVE ENERGY THAN MUD BANKS.

RIO OFFERS A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT ON THE CONVENTIONAL NPV APPROACH, BECAUSE IT INTEGRATES EXPECTED CHANGES IN FUTURE LEVELS OF UNCERTAINTY INTO ECONOMIC ANALYSIS. THIS STUDY APPLIES RIO ANALYSIS TO THE SEMIHYPOTHETICAL CASE STUDY OF A COASTAL DEFENSE SYSTEM TO DEMONSTRATE ITS APPLICABILITY FOR DECISION MAKING ON CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION. IN THE CASE STUDY, TWO DIFFERENT ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES ARE ANALYZED, CONSISTING OF A HARD AND SOFT STRUCTURAL ALTERNATIVE. SOFT STRATEGIES ARE OFTEN INHERENTLY MORE FLEXIBLE THAN HARD STRATEGIES. THE RESULTS OF THE CASE STUDY SHOW THAT THE NPV APPROACH INCREASES THE RELATIVE COST OF SOFT STRATEGIES FOR THE TWO ALTERNATIVES COMPARED WITH HARD STRATEGIES, BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE VALUE OF FLEXIBILITY BUILT INTO ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES. IT IS THEREFORE RECOMMENDED THAT RIO ANALYSIS BE USED FOR THE CHOICE BETWEEN HARD AND SOFT STRATEGIES TO AVOID MALADAPTATION. THIS IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT IN CASES WHERE THERE IS BOTH HIGH CLIMATE UNCERTAINTY AND HIGH DECISION UNCERTAINTY CONCERNING THE BEST STRATEGY. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)WW.1943 5460.0000142.

ONE POTENTIAL STRATEGY IS PLANT HARVESTING AT THE WATER SURFACE TO REMOVE NUTRIENTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE DEPOSITED BACK INTO THE WETLAND DURING SENESCENCE. THIS TECHNICAL NOTE PRESENTS A FIRST LOOK AT THIS STRATEGY FROM A STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE. VEGETATION WAS HARVESTED FROM TWO STORM WATER WETLANDS LOCATED IN SMITHFIELD AND PACTOLUS, NORTH CAROLINA, TO EVALUATE THE ABILITY OF FIVE WETLAND PLANT SPECIES TO SEQUESTER NITROGEN. BIOMASS SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FROM THE FOLLOWING SPECIES OF EMERGENT VEGETATION: PONTEDERIA CORDATA (PICKERELWEED), SAURURUS CERNUUS (LIZARD TAIL), SCIRPUS CYPERINUS (WOOL GRASS), SAGITTARIA LATIFOLIA (ARROWHEAD), AND SCHOENOPLECTUS TABERNAEMONTANI (SOFTSTEM BULRUSH). SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO SENESCENCE IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER 2007 AND ANALYZED FOR NITROGEN CONTENT ON A PERCENT OF BIOMASS BASIS. AT THE PACTOLUS WETLAND THE PONTEDERIA CORDATA, SCIRPUS CYPERINUS, AND SCHOENOPLECTUS TABERNAEMONTANI BIOMASS RETAINED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.05) MORE NITROGEN THAN SAGITTARIA LATIFOLIA AND SAURURUS CERNUUS. AT THE SMITHFIELD WETLAND, PONTEDERIA CORDATA AND SAGITTARIA LATIFOLIA BIOMASS RETAINED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE NITROGEN THAN SCIRPUS CYPERINUS AND SAURURUS CERNUUS. WETLAND MATURITY APPEARS TO HAVE A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP TO HARVESTABLE NITROGEN, WHICH COULD EXPLAIN WHY THE RELATIVE AMOUNT OF NITROGEN SEQUESTERED IN SCIRPUS CYPERINUS AND SAGITTARIA LATIFOLIA VARIED BETWEEN THE TWO WETLANDS. A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP EXISTED BETWEEN THE DENSITY OF HARVESTED BIOMASS AND NITROGEN REMOVAL FOR TWO SPECIES. TO ESTIMATE THE RELATIVE AMOUNT OF HARVESTABLE NITROGEN, A MODEL FOR ESTIMATING TOTAL NITROGEN LOADING IN COASTAL PLAIN WATERSHEDS IN NORTH CAROLINA WAS USED TO COMPARE ESTIMATED INFLOW NITROGEN MASS TO THAT WHICH COULD THEORETICALLY BE HARVESTED. THE HARVESTABLE N MASS WAS GREATER THAN 20% OF INFLOW NITROGEN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. STORM WATER WETLAND PLANT HARVESTING AS A MAINTENANCE ACTIVITY HAS POTENTIAL TO SUPPLEMENT WETLAND NITROGEN REMOVAL.

WE EXAMINED A FUEL PRODUCTION CONCEPT COMBINING SLOW PYROLYSIS CHARS AND SUPERFINE COMMUTATION. CHAR IS MICRONISED AND SUSPENDED IN DIESEL OR WATER TO CREATE A REDUCED COST, QUALITY AND ENERGY DENSITY LIQUID BIOFUEL. PROCESS YIELDS AND EFFICIENCIES WERE DERIVED FROM A REVIEW OF THE SLOW PYROLYSIS CHAR, COAL COMMUTATION AND COMBUSTION LITERATURE AND USED TO DEVELOP THEORETICAL ESTIMATES OF PROCESS PERFORMANCE. CHAR STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION WERE ALSO REVIEWED IN THE CONTEXT OF COMMUTATION AND MANAGEMENT OF ASH AND ALKALIS IN THE FUEL. THE PAPER CONCLUDED THAT CHAR BASED FUELS HAD POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS WHERE COST WAS CRITICAL, BUT QUALITY WAS NOT, SUCH AS DIESEL ENGINES FOR AGRICULTURE, TRUCKS, TRAINS, SHIPPING AND BACKUP ELECTRICITY SUPPLY. CHAR WATER FUELS INCREASE SAFETY BY BEING NON FLAMMABLE AND ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY BENIGN, A VALUABLE TRAIT IN SENSITIVE ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS COASTAL SHIPPING.

IN THE FUTURE IT MAY NOT BE SUSTAINABLE TO CONTINUE TO DEFEND ALL THE LOCATIONS ON THE COAST THAT PRESENTLY BENEFIT FROM DEFENCES. ADAPTATION CAN HELP DELIVER MORE SUSTAINABLE SHORELINE MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS THAT BETTER MANAGE THE RISKS TO THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FUNCTION OF THE COAST. PLANNING FOR ADAPTATION WILL REQUIRE PREPARING COASTAL COMMUNITIES FOR FUTURE CHANGE AND WILL INVOLVE BUILDING IN FLEXIBILITY RATHER THAN CLOSING OFF FUTURE SOLUTIONS. A NUMBER OF CASE STUDIES ARE PRESENTED WHICH EXEMPLIFY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF ADAPTATION. THE PAPER DEMONSTRATES HOW FUTURE REVIEWS OF SHORELINE MANAGEMENT PLANS (SMPS) COULD PROMOTE MORE ADAPTIVE MEASURES LINKED TO THE COASTAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT AREAS THAT WILL FEATURE IN THE NEXT REVISION OF LAND USE PLANS. THE FUTURE CHALLENGES TO DELIVERING MORE ADAPTIVE SOLUTIONS ARE CONSIDERED BY LOOKING AT WHERE ADAPTATION MAY BE NEEDED, WHAT MORE ADAPTIVE APPROACHES MAY LOOK LIKE, AND WHAT THE BARRIERS TO IMPLEMENTATION ARE. ONE CRITICAL AREA IS THE GREATER ENGAGEMENT OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THE PAPER SHOWS HOW THE RECENT COASTAL PATHFINDER PROJECTS ARE TACKLING THIS ISSUE. THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THESE PROJECTS WILL BE INVALUABLE IN ROLLING OUT ADAPTIVE SOLUTIONS TO OTHER AREAS IN THE FUTURE. SUCH SOLUTIONS CAN BE PROGRESSED WITHIN THE POLICIES LAID DOWN IN THE CURRENT SMPS BUT SHOULD BE UPDATED IN FUTURE SMP REVIEWS AS NEW INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE BECOMES AVAILABLE.	***

THIS PAPER WILL SHOW HOW, BY LINKING PLANNING POLICIES TO VARIOUS TYPES OF INTERVENTION, A WORKABLE, SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE APPROACH CAN BE ACHIEVED. THE NEED TO WORK CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITIES IS EMPHASISED WITH EXAMPLES AND CASE STUDIES. DEVELOPMENT IN ZONES AT RISK SHOULD BE RESTRICTED, BUT EQUALLY DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE PERMITTED, PERHAPS BY EXCEPTION, IN OTHER AREAS TO ENSURE THE CONTINUING VIABILITY OF COASTAL COMMUNITIES.

THE LABRANCHE (LB) WETLANDS BORDERING LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN ARE SEVERELY DEGRADED DUE TO SALTWATER INTRUSION, SUBSIDENCE, LEVEEING OF THE RIVER, AND HYDROLOGIC ALTERATIONS INCLUDING PARTIAL IMPOUNDMENT. DIRECTLY ADJACENT IS THE BONNET CARRE (BC) SPILLWAY, A GEOMORPHICALLY SIMILAR AREA THAT CONTAINS HEALTHY BALDCYPRESS SWAMP. THE SPILLWAY CARRIES RIVER WATER TO THE LAKE DURING HIGH DISCHARGE YEARS AND HAS BEEN OPENED ELEVEN TIMES IN 80 YEARS, WITH FLOWS AS HIGH AS 9000 M(3) (S 1). THE PRIMARY HYDROLOGIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AREAS IS THE REGULAR INPUT OF RIVER WATER TO THE BC WETLANDS WHILE THE LB WETLANDS ARE ISOLATED FROM THE RIVER. THE INTERIOR OF THE LB WETLANDS IS ALSO ISOLATED FROM SEDIMENT ORIGINATING FROM LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN. LONG TERM ACCRETION, TREE GROWTH, AND ELEVATION WERE MEASURED IN THESE TWO WETLAND AREAS TO DETERMINE IMPACTS OF RIVERINE INPUT. CS 137 ACCRETION RATES IN THE BC WETLANDS WERE 2.6 2.7 CM YR( 1), COMPARED TO 0.43 AND 1.4 CM YR( 1), RESPECTIVELY, IN THE LB WETLANDS IN AREAS WITHOUT AND WITH SEDIMENT INPUT FROM LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN. BALDYPRESS GROWTH IN THE BC AVERAGED ABOUT 2.3 MM RING WIDTH YR( 1), COMPARED TO 1.4 MM YR( 1) IN LB. TREES ARE OF RELATIVELY THE SAME AGE DUE TO LACK OF RECRUITMENT AND WIDESPREAD LOGGING. TREE HEIGHT, AN INDICATOR OF SITE QUALITY, IS ABOUT 20% LESS AT THE LB SITES COMPARED TO BC, EVEN THOUGH THE TREES ARE APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AGES.

A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE KEY FACTORS AND MECHANISMS GOVERNING THE MIGRATION AND EXCHANGE OF FIB BETWEEN BEACH WATER COLUMN AND SEDIMENT IS DESIRED TO BETTER PREDICT FIB CONCENTRATION VARIATIONS AND ASSESS THE ASSOCIATED RISK. THE TRANSPORT AND RETENTION BEHAVIOR OF TWO MODEL FIB ENTEROCOCCUS FAECALIS (E. FAECALIS) AND ESCHERICHIA COLI (E. COLI) WAS EXAMINED USING PACKED BED COLUMNS IN BOTH SATURATED AND UNSATURATED POROUS MEDIA TO EVALUATE FIB MIGRATION POTENTIALS AT CONDITIONS SIMULATING THE COASTAL AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT. ADDITIONALLY, COMPLEMENTARY CELL CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES WERE CONDUCTED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MIGRATION BEHAVIORS OF BOTH FIB STRAINS OBSERVED IN THE COLUMN EXPERIMENTS. THE MOBILITY OF THE GRAM POSITIVE SPECIES E. FAECALIS WAS MUCH MORE SENSITIVE TO SOLUTION CHEMISTRY AND COLUMN SATURATION LEVEL THAN THAT OF THE GRAM NEGATIVE SPECIES E. COLI. INTERACTION ENERGY CALCULATIONS SUGGEST THAT E. FAECALIS RETENTION WAS LARGELY GOVERNED BY THE COMBINATION OF DLVO (DERJAGUIN LANDAU VERWEY OVERBEEK) AND NON DLVO (MOST LIKELY HYDROPHOBIC AND/OR POLYMER BRIDGING) INTERACTIONS IN SATURATED POROUS MEDIA, WHILE THE COMBINATION OF DLVO AND STERIC INTERACTIONS CONTROLLED THE DEPOSITION OF E. COLI CELLS. THE MEASURED SURFACE PROPERTIES OF THE TWO FIB STRAINS SUPPORTED THE DISTINCT BACTERIA TRANSPORT BEHAVIORS AND THE DIFFERENCES OF THE IDENTIFIED MECHANISMS FOR EACH STRAIN. AS A RESULT, E. FAECALIS SHOWED THE LEAST AFFINITY TO SAND IN FRESHWATER AND APPEARED TO BE IRREVERSIBLY ATTACHED IN PRIMARY ENERGY MINIMA AT ELEVATED SALT CONDITIONS; WHEREAS THE RETAINED E. COLI CELLS WERE REVERSIBLY ATTACHED AND MOSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECONDARY ENERGY MINIMA AT BOTH FRESHWATER AND SEAWATER CONDITIONS. IN UNSATURATED POROUS MEDIA, E. FAECALIS CELLS SEEMED TO PREFER TO ATTACHMENT AT AIR/WATER INTERFACE RATHER THAN SAND SURFACE, WHILE E. COLI SHOWED A SIMILAR AFFINITY TO THE TWO INTERFACES. IT WAS PROPOSED THAT THE DIFFERENT SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TWO FIB STRAINS RESULTED IN THE DISTINCT TRANSPORT AND RETENTION BEHAVIOR IN POROUS MEDIA. THESE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR FIB MANAGEMENT TO CONSIDER VARIATIONS IN TRANSPORT BEHAVIOR BETWEEN MODEL FIB WHEN ASSESSING WATER QUALITY AND ASSOCIATED RISKS.	***

WATER MANAGEMENT PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL AND SOCIETAL RESOURCES. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A PARTICIPATORY STUDY OF COMMUNITY APPROACHES TO REGIONAL ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE. WATER MANAGEMENT ADAPTATION OPTIONS TO REGIONAL CLIMATE INDUCED CHANGES UNTIL 2050 WERE DEVELOPED TOGETHER WITH STAKEHOLDERS FOR THE WESERMARSCH COUNTY (NORTHERN GERMANY). AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON EXPECTED REGIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE AND A MODELLING STUDY ON HYDROLOGICAL CHANGE SUGGESTED THAT ADAPTATION OF WATER MANAGEMENT WILL BE REQUIRED UNTIL 2050. A REGIONAL STAKEHOLDER FORUM FORMULATED A VISION ON HOW THE WESERMARSCH SHOULD LOOK LIKE IN 2050. FOLLOWING THE HOLISTIC APPROACH OF COLLABORATIVE PLANNING, TWO STAKEHOLDER GROUPS DEVELOPED AN ADAPTATION PORTFOLIO ON HOW URBAN AND RURAL AREAS COULD ADAPT THEIR WATER MANAGEMENT TO COPE WITH THE EXPECTED CHANGES. SINCE MOST OF THE STAKEHOLDERS DO NOT WANT THE COUNTY TO UNDERGO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN TERMS OF LANDSCAPE AND LAND USE, THEY PROPOSED TECHNICAL MEASURES TO ENFORCE FLOOD PROTECTION AND ENHANCE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE EXISTING WATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. ADAPTATION IN TERMS OF LAND USE CHANGE WAS NOT PROPOSED ALTHOUGH INFORMATION ON COMPARABLE EXAMPLES FROM SIMILAR REGIONS WAS AVAILABLE. TO JUSTIFY THE PROPOSED ADAPTATION OPTIONS, AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON EXPECTED CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS WAS USED SELECTIVELY. UNCERTAINTY IN MODEL PROJECTIONS WAS PARTLY IGNORED TO LEGITIMATE SUGGESTING INFLEXIBLE (TECHNICAL) ADAPTATION MEASURES.

BASED ON SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS RESULTS OF MODEL PARAMETERS, THE DENITRIFICATION PROCESS IS SENSITIVE TO THE TEMPERATURE CORRECTION FACTOR (B), MAXIMUM NITRATE NITROGEN DECAY RATE (K (MAX)), ACTUAL VARYING RESIDENCE TIME (T (V)), THE CONSTANT DECAY RATE OF DENITRIFIYING BACTERIA (V (DEC)), TEMPERATURE (T), BIOMASS INHIBITION CONSTANT (K (B)), MAXIMUM GROWTH RATE OF DENITRIFIYING BACTERIA (V (MAX)), DENITRIFYING BACTERIA CONCENTRATION (X), LONGITUDINAL DISPERSION COEFFICIENT (K (S)), AND HALF SATURATION CONSTANT OF DISSOLVED CARBON FOR BIOMASS (K (CAR X)); A 10% INCREASE IN THE MODEL PARAMETER VALUES CAUSES A CHANGE IN MODEL ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR (RMSE) OF 28.02, 16.16, 12.35, 11.44, 9.68, 10.61, 16.30, 9.27, 6.58 AND 3.89%, RESPECTIVELY. THE VART DN MODEL WAS TESTED USING THE DATA FROM LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED USING HIGHWAY STORMWATER AND SECONDARY WASTEWATER. MODEL RESULTS FOR THE DENITRIFICATION PROCESS OF HIGHWAY STORMWATER SHOWED A GOOD AGREEMENT WITH OBSERVED DATA AND THE SIMULATION ERROR WAS LESS THAN 9.0%. THE RMSE AND THE COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION FOR SIMULATING DENITRIFICATION PROCESS OF WASTEWATER WERE 0.5167 AND 0.6912, RESPECTIVELY, DEMONSTRATING THE EFFICACY OF THE VART DN MODEL.	***

WHEN THE AQUIFER IS SEMICONFINED AND EXTENDS FOR A CERTAIN DISTANCE D UNDER THE SEA, HEAD RESPONSE RESULTS FROM THE SUPERPOSITION OF TWO TYPES OF EFFECTS: HYDRAULIC (I.E., GROUND WATER FLOW CONNECTION THROUGH AQUIFER AND AQUITARD) AND MECHANICAL (INDUCED BY TIDAL LOADING ONTO THE SEA FLOOR). SOLUTIONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN ANALYZED BEFORE, BUT ONLY FOR D ZERO OR INFINITY. THESE SOLUTIONS DO NOT ALLOW ANALYZING AQUIFER SYSTEMS THAT EXTENDS FOR A FINITE D. OR IDENTIFYING THEM, WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR COASTAL AQUIFER MANAGEMENT. WE DERIVE AN EXACT ANALYTICAL SOLUTION THAT DESCRIBES SEPARATELY THE MECHANICAL AND HYDRAULIC EFFECTS. THE PROPOSED ANALYTICAL SOLUTION IS A GENERALIZATION OF MOST OF EXISTING ANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS. A SIMPLER APPROXIMATE ANALYTICAL SOLUTION IS ALSO OBTAINED FOR SOFT AQUITARDS WITH LOW PERMEABILITIES. WE FIND THAT THE IMPACT OF THE HYDRAULIC COMPONENT OF THE AQUITARD AND THE MECHANICAL EFFECTS IN THE TOTAL HEAD FLUCTUATION AT THE SHORELINE IS SIGNIFICANT, BUT NOT VERY SENSITIVE TO THE PROPERTIES OF THE AQUITARD. THE AMPLITUDE OF THESE FLUCTUATIONS RELATIVE TO THAT OF THE SEA TIDE RANGES APPROXIMATELY BETWEEN 1 (SMALL D) AND 0.5 (LARGE D). THIS IMPLIES THAT AQUIFER PENETRATION UNDER THE SEA CAN INDEED BE IDENTIFIED IF IT IS BELOW A CERTAIN THRESHOLD, BEYOND WHICH THE SYSTEM RESPONDS AS IF D WAS INFINITY. SURPRISINGLY, THE TIME LAG IS CLOSE TO ZERO REGARDLESS OF HYDRAULIC PARAMETERS OF THE AQUIFER SYSTEM. (C) 2012 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

FEW ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO DEVELOP RESTORATION TECHNIQUES FOR SEAWEED BEDS IN INTERTIDAL ECOSYSTEMS, OWING TO THE COMPLEX AND DYNAMIC VARIATIONS IN PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF THE HABITAT. WE DEVELOPED A NEW SARGASSUM THUNBERGII RESTORATION METHOD INVOLVING CREATING INTERTIDAL HABITAT AND SEEDING WITH ARTIFICIALLY COLLECTED GERMLINGS. IN JUNE 2010, ARTIFICIAL RECTANGULAR POOLS CONSTRUCTED OF A 4:5:1 RATE OF HIGH STRENGTH CEMENT, SAND AND WATER ON A ROCKY INTERTIDAL PLATFORM WERE SEEDED WITH S. THUNBERGII GERMLINGS RELEASED FROM FERTILE THALLI DURING LOW TIDE. ARTIFICIAL POOLS WERE COVERED WITH A DOUBLE LAYER SHADING NET UNTIL THE NEXT TIDAL CYCLE TO PREVENT GERMLINGS FROM BEING DISLODGED BY WATER MOTION, RESULTING IN A MAJORITY OF YOUNG GERMLINGS SUCCESSFULLY ATTACHING TO THE POOL BOTTOM BY RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF RHIZOIDS. TWO MONTHS AFTER SEEDING, JUVENILE SPOROPHYTES ATTAINED A LENGTH OF 15 20 MM. AFTER ONE YEAR FOLLOWING SEEDING. S. THUNBERGII IN THE RESTORED BED REACHED A DENSITY OF 118.5 +/ 13.2 (MEAN +/ SE) THALLI M( 2), COVERED 32.7 +/ 0.1% OF THE ARTIFICIAL SUBSTRATE, AND GREW TO AN AVERAGE LENGTH OF 34.2 +/ 1.6 CM WITH 7.3 +/ 0.6 LATERALS PER THALLUS. THE PROPORTION OF FERTILE LATERALS OF RESTORED POPULATION WAS 73.6 +/ 3.0%, INDICATING THAT THESE FERTILE THALLI MAY SERVE AS A SOURCE OF NEW RECRUITS TO ENHANCE THE RECOVERY OF THE ALGAL POPULATION. FURTHERMORE, RESTORED S.

A WETLAND ZOOPLANKTON INDEX (WZI) WAS MODIFIED TO ASSESS THE ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS OF THE RIPARIAN WETLANDS (BOTH NATURAL AND CONSTRUCTED) OF THE PEARL RIVER ESTUARY (PRE), INCLUDING WATER QUALITY, PRESENCE/ABSENCE OF MACROPHYTES, SOIL TEXTURE, WETLAND ORIGIN, WETLAND LOCATION AND ZOOPLANKTON DISTRIBUTION. A WATER QUALITY INDEX (WQI) IS ESTABLISHED TO COMPARE THE ACCURACY OF THE WZI TO CONVENTIONAL COMMUNITY INDICES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ALTHOUGH SOME CONVENTIONAL COMMUNITY INDICES SHOW NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NATURAL AND CONSTRUCTED RIPARIAN WETLANDS, SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SCORES OF WZI AND WQI ARE FOUND IN THE CONSTRUCTED RIPARIAN WETLANDS COMPARED TO THE NATURAL RIPARIAN WETLANDS. THE RESULTS OF A REGRESSION ANALYSIS WITH PEARSONS CORRELATIONS SHOW THAT WZI WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH THE WQI COMPARED WITH THE CONVENTIONAL COMMUNITY INDICES. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY INDICATE THAT THE WZI CAN MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT THE ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS OF WETLANDS THAN THE CONVENTIONAL COMMUNITY INDICES. ALTHOUGH A BETTER WATER QUALITY (LOWER WQI VALUE) IS FOUND IN NATURAL RIPARIAN WETLANDS THAN IN THE CONSTRUCTED RIPARIAN WETLANDS, THE ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS OF NATURAL RIPARIAN WETLANDS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE THAN THOSE OF CONSTRUCTED RIPARIAN WETLANDS, BASED ON THE SCORES OF THE WZI; THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE WETLAND MAY CAUSE A DETERIORATION IN THE WATER QUALITY BUT IS UNLIKELY TO CAUSE A DEGRADATION OF THE WETLANDS.

IT HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED THAT RISING SEA LEVELS DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE TOGETHER WITH THE AGGRESSIVE ENVIRONMENT TO WHICH COASTAL DEFENCE STRUCTURES ARE SUBJECTED CAN LEAD TO SERIOUS DEFECTS COMPROMISING THE INTEGRITY OF THE STRUCTURES. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A METHOD FOR QUANTITATIVELY ASSESSING THE RISK OF WAVE OVERTOPPING OF SEA DEFENCES, ANALYSING THE PROBABILITY OF FAILURE OF THE STRUCTURES UNDER FUTURE HYDRAULIC AND STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS AND PROVIDING COST EFFECTIVE MAINTENANCE PLANNING DURING THE SERVICE LIFE. TYPICAL FAILURE MECHANISMS IN AN EARTH SEA DEFENCE ARE CONSIDERED FOR RELIABILITY ANALYSES, NAMELY EROSION OF DYKE CREST AND LANDSIDE SLOPE BY WAVE OVERTOPPING, PIPING IN THE UNDERLAIN WATER CONDUCTIVE LAYER AND UPLIFTING OF IMPERMEABLE LAYER BEHIND THE STRUCTURE. THE STOCHASTIC DETERIORATION MODEL BASED ON THE GAMMA PROCESS IS ADOPTED TO REPRESENT THE SETTLEMENT OF DYKE CREST HEIGHT AND THE DETERIORATION OF SEEPAGE RESISTANCE. THE TIME DEPENDENT RELIABILITY OF THE EARTH DYKE IS ANALYSED BY USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION METHOD TO GIVE PROBABILITY OF FAILURE OVER TIME. OPTIMAL REPAIR PLANNING DURING THE SERVICE LIFE IS DETERMINED BY OPTIMISING THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE RISK OF FAILURE AND THE COSTS FOR MAINTENANCE. THE NUMERICAL RESULTS FOR THE EXAMPLE TYPICAL EARTH DYKE SECTION SHOW THAT OVERTOPPING IS A DOMINANT FAILURE MECHANISM WITH SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING FAILURE PROBABILITY OVER TIME. THE OPTIMAL REPAIR TIME LARGELY DEPENDS ON THE DETERIORATION RATE OF STRUCTURAL RESISTANCE AND THE RELATIVE COST OF PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE.	***

BEFORE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OR LCA IS USED TO QUANTIFY THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM LANDFILLING ACTIVITIES, AN ATTEMPT TO INCORPORATE LOCALIZED AND EMPIRICAL INFORMATION INTO THE AMOUNTS OF ASH AND MSW SENT TO THE LANDFILL WAS MADE. A LINEAR REGRESSION REPRESENTATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MASS OF WASTE DISPOSED AND THE MASS OF INCINERATION ASH GENERATED WAS MODELED FROM WASTE STATISTICS BETWEEN YEARS 2004 AND 2009. NEXT, THE MASS OF INDIVIDUAL MSW COMPONENTS WAS PROJECTED FROM 2010 TO 2030. THE LCA RESULTS HIGHLIGHTED THAT IN A BUSINESS AS USUAL SCENARIO THE NORMALIZED TOTAL IMPACTS OF GLOBAL WARMING, ACIDIFICATION AND HUMAN TOXICITY INCREASED BY ABOUT 2% ANNUALLY FROM 2011 TO 2030. BY REPLACING THE 8000 TONNE BARGE WITH A 10000 TONNE COASTAL BULK CARRIER OR FREIGHTER (IN SCENARIO 2) A GRAND TOTAL REDUCTION OF 48% OF BOTH GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL AND ACIDIFICATION CAN BE REALIZED BY YEAR 2030.

GRAVEL BARRIER BEHAVIOUR DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS SUCH AS SEDIMENT PROPERTIES (POROSITY, PERMEABILITY, GRAINSIZE), GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND WAVE CLIMATE. SINCE OVERWASH PROCESSES ARE KNOWN TO CONTROL SHORT TERM GRAVEL BARRIER DYNAMICS AND LONG TERM BARRIER MIGRATION, THE DEVELOPMENT OF A ROBUST QUANTITATIVE METHOD TO DEFINE THE CRITICAL CONDITIONS LEADING TO GRAVEL BARRIER OVERWASHING IS IMPORTANT BOTH FOR SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. IT IS KNOWN THAT WHEN WAVE RUNUP EXCEEDS THE BARRIER CREST ELEVATION, THREE OUTCOMES ARE POSSIBLE: 1) INSIGNIFICANT MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGE, WHEN WAVE RUNUP JUST OVERTOPS THE BARRIER CREST AND FLOW VELOCITIES ARE VERY WEAK; 2) OVERTOPPING, RESULTING IN ACCRETION ON THE BARRIER CREST REGION AND BARRIER STABILISATION; AND 3) OVERWASHING, RESULTING IN EROSION, LOWERING OF THE CREST REGION AND ULTIMATELY TO BARRIER INUNDATION. THIS STUDY PROVIDES AN INSIGHT INTO THE CRITICAL CONDITIONS THAT DISTINGUISH THESE TWO POSSIBLE OUTCOMES AND TO THE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS THAT PROVIDE THE REQUIRED POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FEEDBACKS TO THE SEDIMENT DYNAMICS. IN ORDER TO DEFINE THE OVERWASH THRESHOLD CONDITION, AND TO PREDICT THE MORPHOLOGICAL OUTCOME OF PARTICULAR OVERWASH EVENTS, USE IS MADE HERE OF THE OVERWASH POTENTIAL (OP). DEFINED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WAVE RUNUP AND THE BARRIER CREST ELEVATION. TO MAKE EFFECTIVE USE OF OP IT IS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY A RELIABLE RUNUP PREDICTOR. FOLLOWING TESTS USING 12 RUNUP EQUATIONS THE STOCKDON ET AL. [STOCKDON, H.F., HOLMAN, RA., HOWD, P.A., SALLENGER, A.H., 2006. EMPIRICAL PARAMETERIZATION OF SETUP, SWASH, AND RUNUP. COAST.

THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT BY THE YEAR 2100 EXCEEDANCE PROBABILITIES MAY DOUBLE FOR THE IMPACT OF THE LARGEST STORMS SUCH AS HURRICANE IKE, BUT MAY INCREASE BY 6 7 TIMES FOR THE SMALLER SURGES ASSOCIATED LOCALLY WITH THE IMPACT OF STORMS SUCH AS HURRICANES CINDY, ALICIA, AND RITA. WHILE INDIVIDUALLY NOT AS DEVASTATING OR COSTLY AS LARGE HURRICANES, THE CUMULATIVE AND REGULAR COST OF SMALLER SURGE EVENTS COULD WELL BE A BIGGER THREAT TO COASTAL COMMUNITIES AS SEA LEVEL RISES.

THE ANALYSIS IS UNDERTAKEN FOR TWO PROJECTS: A SMALL SCALE COASTAL PROTECTION PROJECT USING A REVETMENT AND A MEDIUM SIZE CAPITAL HARBOUR EXPANSION USING A BREAKWATER. THIS WORK PROVIDES FURTHER INSIGHT INTO PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED WORK BY SHEEHAN ET AL. (2009) ON THE ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF GEOTUBE TECHNOLOGY AND IDENTIFIES THE OPTIMUM METHOD OF CONSTRUCTION FOR EACH TYPE OF COASTAL STRUCTURE. AN ECONOMIC SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS UNDERTAKEN ON THE KEY LOGISTICAL PARAMETERS INVOLVED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE COASTAL STRUCTURES. AN ENVIRONMENTAL SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON THE CO2 EMISSIONS PRODUCED FROM THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE COASTAL STRUCTURES FOR BOTH CONSTRUCTION METHODS. THESE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES ARE UNDERTAKEN USING A DECISION SUPPORT SOFTWARE PROGRAM (DMMAP), DEVELOPED TO ASSIST USERS AT THE PLANNING STAGES OF A PROJECT TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE DREDGE MATERIAL MANAGEMENT. THE KEY LOGISTICAL PARAMETERS ARE ANALYSED TO GENERATE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC RANKING TABLES. THE ANALYSES HIGHLIGHT THAT THE SIZE OF THE STRUCTURE AND THE DISTANCE TO THE SOURCE OF THE QUARRY MATERIAL ARE CRUCIAL FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE OPTIMUM CONSTRUCTION METHOD. THIS WORK SHOWS THAT GEOTUBES ARE A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL RUBBLE MOUND COASTAL STRUCTURES. IT ALSO SHOWS THAT TRADITIONAL CONSTRUCTION METHODS MAY BE MORE ECONOMICAL THAN GEOTUBE STRUCTURES WHEN CONSIDERING SMALL COASTAL STRUCTURES. IN GENERAL, THE LARGER THE SCALE OF THE PROJECT THE GREATER THE POTENTIAL SAVINGS IN CO2 EMISSIONS AND COST THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE USE OF GEOTUBE TECHNOLOGY. GEOTUBES, WITH THE USE OF DREDGE MATERIAL, MAY PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE BENEFICIAL USE FOR DREDGE MATERIAL AND OFFER A SERIOUS ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL RUBBLE MOUND STRUCTURES.

AT THE SAME TIME, DEVELOPMENTS IN SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING, PARTICULARLY ESTIMATES OF GROUNDWATER STORAGE USING THE GRAVITY RECOVERY AND CLIMATE EXPERIMENT (GRACE), HAVE DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED WATER RESOURCE ASSESSMENT. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE POTENTIAL FOR GRACE BASED ASSESSMENT OF GROUNDWATER RESOURCES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PERSISTENT CHALLENGES OF WATER MANAGEMENT IN YEMEN, WHICH SUFFERS FROM ACUTE GROUNDWATER DEPLETION AND WATER SCARCITY. BY COMPARING GRACE ESTIMATES OF GROUNDWATER STORAGE CHANGE TO OBSERVED WELL MEASUREMENTS IN YEMEN, THIS STUDY INDICATES THAT GRACE CAN COMPLEMENT INSTITUTIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT REFORM BY PROVIDING BETTER WATER RESOURCES INFORMATION, ESPECIALLY IN COMBINATION WITH SOCIOECONOMIC DATA VISUALIZED IN A GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS). HOWEVER, THE CASE OF YEMEN ALSO INDICATES THAT COMMONLY ACCEPTED PRINCIPLES OF WATER MANAGEMENT MUST BE ADAPTED TO HARNESS THE POTENTIAL OF GRACE BASED GROUNDWATER STORAGE ASSESSMENT.	***

SURFACE WATER SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FROM FIVE SITES, THROUGHOUT THE AGRICULTURALLY INFLUENCED NATHAN CREEK WATERSHED, BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA AND A NEARBY CONTROL SITE BETWEEN OCTOBER 2005 AND MARCH 2006. FROM A TOTAL OF 48 SAMPLES, CANADIAN WATER QUALITY GUIDELINES WERE EXCEEDED NINETEEN TIMES FOR NITRATE (NO3 ; GUIDELINE VALUE: 2.94 MG/L N) AND FOUR TIMES FOR UN IONIZED AMMONIA (NH3; GUIDELINE VALUE 0.019 MG/L N). GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY MASS SPECTROMETRY SINGLE ION MONITORING (GC MS SIM) ANALYSIS OF 18 STEROLS SHOWED THAT FIVE FECAL STEROLS (COPROSTANOL, EPISOPROSTANOL, CHOLESTEROL, CHOLESTANOL, DESMOSTEROL) WERE DETECTED AT ALL SITES EXCEPT THE CONTROL SITE (WHERE ONLY CHOLESTEROL, CHOLESTANOL AND DESMOSTEROL WERE DETECTED). THREE PHYTOSTEROLS (CAMPESTEROL, STIGMASTEROL AND B SITOSTEROL) WERE ALSO DETECTED AT ALL SITES WHILE THE HORMONE ESTRONE WAS PRESENT AT ONE SITE ON TWO OCCASIONS AT CONCENTRATIONS OF 0.01. AND 0.04 MU G/L. CHEMOMETRIC ANALYSIS (PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS AND CLUSTER ANALYSIS) GROUPED SITES BASED ON THEIR SIMILARITIES IN STEROL COMPOSITION. ANALYSIS OF TEN STEROL RATIOS (SEVEN FOR IDENTIFYING HUMAN FECAL CONTAMINATION AND FOUR FOR DIFFERENTIATING SOURCES OF FECAL CONTAMINATION) SHOWED MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF HUMAN AND ANIMAL CONTAMINATION FOR EVERY SITE BUT THE CONTROL SITE. APPLICATION OF A BACTEROIDES BST METHOD CONFIRMED CONTAMINATION FROM RUMINANT ANIMALS, PIGS AND DOGS IN VARYING COMBINATIONS AT ALL IMPACT SITES. TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS CONFIRMED THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES ON THE NATHAN CREEK WATERSHED AND SUPPORT A NEED FOR BETTER LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO PROTECT WATER QUALITY AND AQUATIC LIFE.

TO COMPREHENSIVELY RECORD TSUNAMI TRACE HEIGHTS AND IMPACTS ALONG THE COASTAL REGION, THE TOHOKU EARTHQUAKE TSUNAMI JOINT SURVEY GROUP WAS ORGANIZED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EVENT. AS PART OF THIS GROUP, THE AUTHORS CONDUCTED A FIELD SURVEY IN MIYAGI AND FUKUSHIMA PREFECTURES. THE SURVEYED AREA CAN BE DIVIDED INTO 2 PARTS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ITS GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES: THE NORTHERN PART (A RIAS COASTAL AREA) AND THE SOUTHERN PART (A COASTAL PLAIN AREA). IN THIS PAPER, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DAMAGE DUE TO THE TSUNAMI IN EACH AREA ARE ANALYZED BY USING BOTH THE RESULTS OF THE AUTHORS BY USING BOTH THE RESULTS OF THE AUTHORS OWN FIELD SURVEY AND THE JOINT SURVEY GROUP. IN THE RIAS COASTAL AREA, INUNDATION HEIGHTS WERE MORE THAN 10 M, WHICH RESULTED IN THE FLOODING OF THE LOW LYING GROUNDS LOCATED AT THE INNER PART OF THE BAYS. THE TSUNAMI WAVE CAUSED WIDESPREAD DESTRUCTION IN THIS AREA, AND COASTAL BUILDINGS (INCLUDING REINFORCED CONCRETE BUILDINGS) SUFFERED SEVERE DAMAGE. IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAINS, INUNDATION HEIGHTS WERE 5 10 M AND THE TSUNAMI REACHED A FEW KILOMETERS INLAND, THOUGH UNFORTUNATELY THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH HIGH LOCATIONS OR BUILDINGS FOR THE RESIDENTS TO EVACUATE. IN ADDITION, AN EXTENSIVE LINE OF COASTAL DIKES AND FORESTS, WHICH HAD BEEN PLACED TO PROTECT THE WIDE PLAINS BEHIND THEM, ALSO SUFFERED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE. FROM THESE GEOGRAPHICALLY DEPENDENT INUNDATION AND DESTRUCTION PATTERNS, A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT LESSONS ON HOW TO MODIFY AND IMPROVE FUTURE RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES CAN BE OBTAINED.	***

INDIVIDUAL BREAKING EVENTS ARE FIRST IDENTIFIED FROM CHANGES IN OPTICAL PROPERTIES AND WAVE HEIGHT IS FURTHER DERIVED FROM THE OPTICAL SIGNATURE AT THE ONSET OF BREAKING. AN EXTENDED VALIDATION IS PERFORMED USING A DENSE WAVE BASIN DATASET. THE RESULTS SHOW THE ABILITY OF THE METHOD TO MEASURE INDIVIDUAL BREAKER HEIGHTS (9% OF MEAN ERROR, 18% RMS). IN ADDITION, THE UNIQUE COMBINATION OF IN SITU AND REMOTELY SENSED DATA ALLOWS THE ESTIMATION OF TWO OTHER BREAKING RELATED PARAMETERS, THE HEIGHT TO DEPTH RATIO AND WAVE FRONT FACE SLOPE, WHICH SHOW A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF DISPERSION. BECAUSE NEARSHORE VIDEO SYSTEMS ARE RAPIDLY SPREADING OVER WORLD COASTS, THIS LOW COST REMOTE BREAKER HEIGHT ESTIMATOR SHOULD ENCOUNTER LARGE INTEREST IN COASTAL ENGINEERING STUDIES.

AFTER APPROPRIATE PRETREATMENTS, ELEVEN HIERARCHICALLY STRUCTURED INDICATORS, SUBJECT TO CATASTROPHE MODELS, WERE AGGREGATED INTO AN INTEGRATED INDEX FOR EACH 30 M GRID CELL ACROSS THE STUDY AREA. GREAT SPATIAL VARIATIONS IN AGROECOSYSTEM HEALTH WERE IDENTIFIED. AREAS COVERED BY WATER BODIES AND IMPERVIOUS SURFACES, UNDER WHICH SOILS CAN NOT FUNCTION, GENERALLY PRESENTED LOW VALUES. LARGER SLOPE OR HIGHER HEAVY METAL POLLUTED AREAS AND THOSE NEAR ROADS SHOWED LOW OR MODERATE VALUES OF AGROECOSYSTEM HEALTH INDEX. CONCERNING THE SPATIAL VARIATIONS OF AGROECOSYSTEMS HEALTH, PATCHES OF APPROXIMATELY 4 KM IN DIAMETER WERE IDENTIFIED, WITHIN WHICH MORE HOMOGENOUS PATTERNS WOULD BE EXPECTED. SPECIFICALLY, THE SPATIAL VARIATIONS OF AGROECOSYSTEMS HEALTH SHOULD BE RESULTED FROM THE LOCATION SPECIFIC COUPLED INFLUENCES OF THE UNDERLYING INDICATORS. THE INTEGRATED AGROECOSYSTEM HEALTH INDEX IS BELIEVED TO BE HELPFUL FOR MANAGERS TO PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT.

AS A RESULT, MANY PUMPING WELLS IN THE COASTAL ZONE HAVE BEEN TERMINATED AND A NUMBER OF FARMS HAVE BEEN ABANDONED. IN THIS PAPER, MODFLOW WAS USED TO SIMULATE THE GROUNDWATER FLOW AND ASSESS THE SEAWATER INTRUSION IN THE COASTAL AQUIFER OF WADI HAM.

WHILE A NUMBER OF METHODS/MODELS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO MEET THE BEACH ACT REQUIREMENT, NO SYSTEMATIC COMPARISONS OF DIFFERENT METHODS AGAINST THE SAME DATA SERIES ARE AVAILABLE IN TERMS OF RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF EXISTING METHODS. THIS STUDY PRESENTS AND COMPARES THREE MODELS FOR NOWCASTING AND FORECASTING ENTEROCOCCI LEVELS AT GULF COAST BEACHES IN LOUISIANA, USA. ONE WAS DEVELOPED USING THE ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN) IN MATLAB TOOLBOX AND THE OTHER TWO WERE BASED ON THE US EPA VIRTUAL BEACH (VB) PROGRAM. A TOTAL OF 944 SETS OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND BACTERIOLOGICAL DATA WERE UTILIZED. THE DATA WERE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED WEEKLY DURING THE SWIMMING SEASON (MAY OCTOBER) AT SIX SITES OF THE HOLLY BEACH BY LOUISIANA BEACH MONITORING PROGRAM IN THE SIX YEAR PERIOD OF MAY 2005 OCTOBER 2010. THE ANN MODEL INCLUDES 15 READILY AVAILABLE ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES SUCH AS SALINITY, WATER TEMPERATURE, WIND SPEED AND DIRECTION, TIDE LEVEL AND TYPE, WEATHER TYPE, AND VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF ANTECEDENT RAINFALLS. THE ANN MODEL WAS TRAINED, VALIDATED, AND TESTED USING 308, 103, AND 103 DATA SETS (COLLECTED IN 2007, 2008, AND 2009) WITH AN AVERAGE LINEAR CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (LCC) OF 0.857 AND A ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR (RMSE) OF 0.336. THE TWO VB MODELS, INCLUDING A LINEAR TRANSFORMATION BASED MODEL AND A NONLINEAR TRANSFORMATION BASED MODEL, WERE CONSTRUCTED USING THE SAME DATA SETS. THE LINEAR VB MODEL WITH 6 INPUT VARIABLES ACHIEVED AN LCC OF 0.230 AND AN RMSE OF 1.302 WHILE THE NONLINEAR VB MODEL WITH 5 INPUT VARIABLES PRODUCED AN LCC OF 0.337 AND AN RMSE OF 1.205. IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE OF THE ANN AND VB MODELS, HINDCASTING WAS CONDUCTED USING A TOTAL OF 430 SETS OF INDEPENDENT ENVIRONMENTAL AND BACTERIOLOGICAL DATA COLLECTED AT SIX HOLLY BEACH SITES IN 2005, 2006, AND 2010. THE HINDCASTING RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ANN MODEL IS CAPABLE OF PREDICTING ENTEROCOCCI LEVELS AT THE HOLLY BEACH SITES WITH AN ADJUSTED RMSE OF 0.803 AND LCC OF 0.320 WHILE THE ADJUSTED RMSE AND LCC VALUES ARE 1.815 AND 0.354 FOR THE LINEAR VB MODEL AND 1.961 AND 0.521 FOR THE NONLINEAR VB MODEL. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE ANN MODEL WITH 15 PARAMETERS PERFORMS BETTER THAN THE VB MODELS WITH 6 OR 5 PARAMETERS IN TERMS OF RMSE WHILE VB MODELS PERFORM BETTER THAN THE ANN MODEL IN TERMS OF LCC. THE PREDICTIVE MODELS (ESPECIALLY THE ANN AND THE NONLINEAR VB MODELS) DEVELOPED IN THIS STUDY IN COMBINATION WITH READILY AVAILABLE REAL TIME ENVIRONMENTAL AND WEATHER FORECAST DATA CAN BE UTILIZED TO NOWCAST AND FORECAST BEACH WATER QUALITY, GREATLY REDUCING THE POTENTIAL RISK OF CONTAMINATED BEACH WATERS TO HUMAN HEALTH AND IMPROVING BEACH MANAGEMENT. WHILE THE MODELS WERE DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE HOLLY BEACH, LOUISIANA, THE METHODS USED IN THIS PAPER ARE GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO OTHER COASTAL BEACHES. (C) 2011 ELSEVIER LTD.

EIGHTY EIGHT TRANSECTS, EACH COVERING 1425 M(2), WERE SAMPLED ALONG FOUR SITES FROM APRIL 2008 TO MARCH 2009. RESULTS SHOWED 20,336 ITEMS (CA. 14 ITEMS PER M(2)) OF WHICH CIGARETTE BUTTS (33%), PAPERS (31%), AND PLASTICS (22%) WERE THE MOST COMMONLY LITTERED ITEMS. HIGHER AMOUNTS OF LITTER WERE FOUND IN AN INDUSTRIAL AREA (CITYS HARBOR), WHILE THE ABUNDANCE OF LITTER APPEARED RELATIVELY EVEN THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES INDICATED A HIGH ABUNDANCE OF ALL THREE ANTHROPOGENIC VARIABLES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT AREA OF THE CITY AND AN AREA IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO A MAJOR SEASIDE RESORT, WHERE CIGARETTE BUTTS AND PAPERS DOMINATED. THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY THAT HAS EXAMINED SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATIONS OF URBAN LITTER IN A HIGH DENSITY COASTAL CITY IN ARGENTINA. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT ADDRESSING THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH URBAN LITTER MUST INCLUDE INTENSIVE EDUCATIONAL AND ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS DIRECTED AT PEDESTRIANS AND OWNERS OF PARKED VEHICLES, BUT WASTE REDUCTION, CLEAN UP OPERATIONS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD BE ALSO CONSIDERED.

THIS WORK DERIVES NOVEL ANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS FOR ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM BY EXTENDING THE GIRINSKII STRACK CONCEPT OF DISCHARGE POTENTIAL TO REPRESENT REGIONAL, STEADY STATE, SHARP INTERFACE SEAWATER INTRUSION IN A SLOPING UNCONFINED COASTAL AQUIFER. THE AQUIFER HAS HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY K, IS RECHARGED UNIFORMLY AT THE RATE R, RECEIVES AN INFLOW AT ITS LAND BOUNDARY AND HAS A COLLECTOR TROUGH (OR WELL GALLERY IDEALISED AS LINE SINK) LOCATED AT THE DISTANCE I W FROM THE COASTLINE THAT PENETRATES THE AQUIFER AND DRAWS GROUNDWATER AT THE RATE Q(W). THE THEORY RESTS ON THE APPROXIMATION OF A LINEARISED GRAVITY PART OF THE HYDRAULIC POTENTIAL. ANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS FOR THE DISCHARGE POTENTIAL ARE DERIVED, THROUGH WHICH THE HYDRAULIC HEAD, THE FLOW DEPTH AND THE SHARP INTERFACE, AND PARTICULARLY THE LOCATION OF THE INTERFACE TOE, L(T), ARE ALSO DETERMINED. THESE SOLUTIONS SIMPLIFY TO KNOWN RESULTS FOR THE HORIZONTAL AQUIFER CASE. THE UTILITY (AND ROBUSTNESS TO UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE BASE SLOPE) OF THE RESULTS IN APPLICATIONS IS DEMONSTRATED IN THE REGIONAL EXAMPLE OF THE AKROTIRI COASTAL AQUIFER, CYPRUS. RECASTING THE PROBLEM IN NON DIMENSIONAL FORM PROVIDES A RELATIONSHIP FOR THE DEPENDENCE OF THE RELATIVE INTERFACE TOE LOCATION L(T)/L(W) ON THE APPROPRIATELY NORMALISED DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUNDWATER FLOW JUST UP GRADIENT OF THE COLLECTOR TROUGH, Q(O), AND THE PUMPING RATE, Q(W), GIVEN VALUES OF THE BASE SLOPE, R/K AND H SEA/L(W), WHERE H SEA IS THE SEA SURFACE ELEVATION ABOVE THE AQUIFER BASE AT THE COASTLINE. THAT RELATIONSHIP FRAMES A COMMON GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT PROBLEM IN COASTAL AQUIFERS SUBJECT TO A CERTAIN EXPLOITATION SCHEME, WITH L(T) AS DECISION VARIABLE. IN AN EXPLORATORY DEMONSTRATION STUDY, NON DIMENSIONAL SETS OF PERFORMANCE CURVES ARE CALCULATED FOR THE REGIONAL AKROTIRI AQUIFER.

THIS STUDY INTEGRATES TWO IMPORTANT CONCEPTS IN FLOODPLAIN HYDROLOGY; THE FLOOD PULSE CONCEPT AND THE OXBOW LAKE CYCLE. HIGH TEMPORAL RESOLUTION (0.5 3.0 H) LAKE LEVEL DATA FROM VENTED PRESSURE TRANSDUCERS AND RIVER DISCHARGE DATA (0.25 H RESOLUTION) WERE UTILIZED TO DEVELOP STANDARDIZED INDICES OF HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY FOR TWO OXBOW LAKES ALONG THE LOWER GUADALUPE RIVER, TEXAS OVER A 3.4 YR PERIOD. THE LAKES WERE INFLUENCED BY HYDROLOGIC CONDITIONS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NORTHWESTERN GULF REGION, NOTABLY A SEVERE DROUGHT AND A WET SEASON ASSOCIATED WITH LA NINA AND EL NINO, RESPECTIVELY. BECAUSE THE DATA WERE OBTAINED OVER THE SAME PERIOD IT ENABLES A DIRECT COMPARISON OF SURFICIAL HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY WITHIN THE EVOLUTIONARY GEOMORPHIC FRAMEWORK OF THE OXBOW LAKE CYCLE. A RECENTLY (13 YR OLD) FORMED OXBOW LAKE WAS CONNECTED 5.9 TIMES PER YR AND AN OLDER PARTIALLY INFILLED OXBOW LAKE WAS CONNECTED 3.8 TIMES PER YR DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. EACH OXBOW LAKE WAS CONNECTED BY DISCHARGE PULSES BELOW BANKFULL DISCHARGE, AND THE SIGNATURE OF HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY. THE FLOW DURATION FOR CONNECTIVITY WAS 18% AND 3% FOR THE RECENTLY FORMED AND OLDER OXBOW LAKE, RESPECTIVELY. BIVARIATE RELATIONS BETWEEN DISCHARGE AND LAKE STAGE VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THE TWO OXBOW LAKES. THE RECENTLY FORMED OXBOW LAKE EXHIBITED HIGHLY LINEAR RELATIONS BETWEEN DISCHARGE AND LAKE LEVELS, AND LAKE DRAINAGE CLOSELY MIRRORED FLOOD WAVE RECESSION. OLDER OXBOW LAKE CONNECTIVITY WAS COMPLEX, AS DISCHARGE AND LAKE LEVEL RELATIONS WERE NONLINEAR AND EXHIBITED PRONOUNCED NEGATIVE HYSTERESIS, WHICH INCREASED WITH SEQUENTIAL FLOOD PULSES. WHILE THE OLDER OXBOW LAKE WAS MORE SENSITIVE TO SHORT TERM LOW FLOW CONDITIONS, BOTH LAKES WERE COMPLETELY DESICCATED DURING AN EXTENDED LA NINA INFLUENCED DROUGHT. THIS INDICATES A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT TO ALLUVIAL AQUIFERS, WHICH WERE UNABLE TO SUPPLY GROUNDWATER TO OXBOW LAKES DURING EXTENDED DRY PERIODS. THE FLOOD PULSE CONCEPT APPLIED WITH ONLY RIVER DISCHARGE DATA IS OVERLY SIMPLISTIC AND DOES NOT ADEQUATELY CHARACTERIZE HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY FOR DISTINCT TYPES OF OXBOW LAKES ALONG MEANDERING RIVER FLOODPLAINS. WITH LIMITED LAKE LEVEL DATA, HOWEVER, GREAT POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE INTEGRATED FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT PLANS THAT MORE APPROPRIATELY CONSIDERS VARIABLE HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY INHERENT WITHIN THE OXBOW LAKE CYCLE.

IN THIS STUDY, DATA FROM A WATER TABLE MONITORING NETWORK WERE USED TO DEVELOP AN EMPIRICAL METHOD FOR PREDICTING WATER TABLE DEPTH IN SPACE AND TIME FROM A SOIL MAP, CUMULATIVE RAINFALL DATA AND LONG TERM WATER TABLE CHARACTERISTICS, IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE IRRIGATION MANAGEMENT AT REGIONAL SCALE. RECORDS OF 160 PIEZOMETER SITES AVAILABLE FROM 1997 TO 2008 WERE ANALYZED TO DETECT THE OVERALL TEMPORAL TREND IN WATER TABLE DEPTH IN A RELEVANT AGRICULTURAL AREA OF NORTHERN ITALY (EXTENT OF ABOUT 12,000 KM(2)). A CLEAR TREND IN WATER TABLE LOWERING IS OBSERVED OVER THE 12 YEARS OF AVAILABLE OBSERVATIONS, WITH AN AVERAGE RATE OF 4.5 CM PER YEAR. PRECIPITATION DATA FOR THE YEARS 2004 2008 AND THE RECORDS FROM 25 SELECTED SITES (N 2299) FOR THE SAME PERIOD WERE USED TO CALIBRATE A PREDICTIVE TOOL BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION OF A SINUSOIDAL BEHAVIOR OF THE WATER TABLE DEPTH WITH A BIMODAL YEARLY CYCLE. THE PROPOSED MODEL USES AS INPUTS THE CUMULATIVE RAINFALL IN THE PREVIOUS 365 DAYS TO THAT OF PREDICTION AND THE GEOSTATISTICAL ESTIMATES OF THE LONG TERM (2005 2008) YEARLY AVERAGE WATER TABLE DEPTH AND OSCILLATION. THE MODEL, CALIBRATED FOR THE WHOLE DATA SET AND FOR SUBSETS OF SITES GROUPED IN TERMS OF FUNCTIONAL SOIL PROPERTIES, WAS VALIDATED AGAINST THE WT DEPTHS OBSERVED IN 7 INDEPENDENT SITES DURING 2005 2008 (N 654). VALIDATION RESULTS SHOWED A MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR OF 37.1 CM FOR THE GENERAL MODEL AND 33.1 CM FOR THE MODEL CALIBRATED ON THE SOIL GROUPS SUBSETS. THE ACCURACY OF PREDICTION WAS HIGHER IN YEARS WITH PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS CLOSER TO THE OBSERVED AVERAGE. THE GENERAL MODEL WAS EVENTUALLY EXTENDED TO THE WHOLE STUDY AREA, PROVIDING SPATIO TEMPORAL MAPS OF THE WATER TABLE DEPTH. THE RESULTS WERE FURTHER VALIDATED AGAINST THE WATER TABLE DEPTHS OBSERVED IN ALL THE PIEZOMETERS AT THREE DATES IN 2009: ERROR STATISTICS COMPUTED FOR THE WHOLE SET OF AVAILABLE READINGS AT THE THREE SELECTED DATES (N 322), RESULTED IN A MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR OF 37.7 CM.

THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE USE OF REMOTE SENSING DATA IN MONITORING THE CHANGES ALONG THE COASTAL ZONE INCLUDING SHORELINE WITH REASONABLE ACCURACY. REMOTE SENSING DATA HELPS AND/OR REPLACES THE CONVENTIONAL SURVEY BY ITS REPETITIVE AND LESS COST EFFECTIVENESS. IN THIS STUDY, NECESSARY DATA REPRESENTING SATELLITE IMAGE SPOT 5 FOR YEAR 2005 AND 2010 WITH 2.5 M RESOLUTION WERE INTEGRATED IN ORDER TO SEE THE TEMPORAL CHANGE AND ANALYZE THE SILTATION EFFECT OVER THE YEARS. ALL THE PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS WERE DONE USING ERDAS IMAGINE 9.2. MONITORING CHANGES IN SHORELINE HELPS TO IDENTIFY THE NATURE AND PROCESSES THAT CAUSED THESE CHANGES IN ANY SPECIFIC AREA, TO ACCESS THE HUMAN IMPACT AND TO PLAN MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. RESULTS FROM DATA ANALYSIS HAD SHOWN THAT THERE EXISTS A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP EXISTED BETWEEN THE OPEN AREA AND SEDIMENTATION LOADING RATE, DEPENDING ON THEIR LOCATION OF OPEN AREAS WITH RESPECT TO FACTORS SUCH AS AVAILABILITY OF SEDIMENT, SOIL TYPE, SLOPE LENGTH AND SLOPE STEEPNESS.

DURING THE 60 DAYS OF MONTHLY SURVEYS, WE RECORDED OVER 2.6X10(6) RECORDS OF DATA WITH SHIP POSITION INFORMATION. THERE WERE 1181 HOURS OF AIS AND 540 HOURS OF RADAR DATA COLLECTED FOR A MONTHLY MEAN OF 98 AND 45 HOURS FOR AIS AND RADAR RESPECTIVELY. THESE DATA REPRESENTED 1411 TRANSITS BY VESSELS BROADCASTING AIS FOR A TOTAL OF 69,606KM OF TRACK LINE, AND VESSELS ACQUIRED WITH RADAR REPRESENTED A TOTAL OF 506 TRANSITS FOR A TOTAL OF 8,702KM OF TRACK LINE. AIS AND RADAR DATA RESULTED IN 1.2 AND 0.9 TRANSITS PER HOUR RESPECTIVELY. WE CORRECTED THE AIS DATA TO MATCH RADAR EFFORT, AND, WHEN EFFORT WAS EQUAL, AIS DATA REPRESENTED ONLY 49.7% OF THE TOTAL LARGE VESSEL TRANSITS OBSERVED, AND TRANSITS PER HOUR WERE EQUAL FOR CORRECTED AIS AND RADAR DATA. WE RECORDED MORE INBOUND VESSELS USING AIS AND MORE OUTBOUND VESSELS WITH RADAR. THE DENSITY PATTERN OF VESSELS RECORDED USING AIS DIFFERED FROM THE RADAR PATTERN. THERE WAS A VERY DISCRETE PATTERN FOR VESSELS BROADCASTING AN AIS SIGNAL THAT CORRESPONDED WITH THE SHIPPING LANE BUOYS. VESSELS RECORDED USING RADAR, ON THE OTHER HAND, WERE MORE DISPERSED AND DISPLAYED A LESS DISCRETE PATTERN COVERING A LARGE AREA OUTSIDE OF THE SHIP BUOYS. WINTER WAS THE SEASON WITH THE FEWEST VESSEL TRANSITS FOR BOTH DATA COLLECTION METHODS (23.8% AIS; 17.0% RADAR), THOUGH THERE WAS NOT A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE OVER OTHER SEASONS IN THE AIS DATA. SPRING, SUMMER AND FALL WERE SIMILAR FOR AIS (24.2%, 25.7%, 26.3% RESPECTIVELY), BUT FALL (31.4%) HAD CONSIDERABLY MORE VESSELS RECORDED BY RADAR THAN SPRING AND SUMMER (26.5%, 25.1% RESPECTIVELY). WHEN EXAMINING VESSEL TYPE DATA, MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF THE VESSEL TRANSITS RECORDED USING AIS WERE CARGO VESSELS (68%; N 337). EXCLUDING UNKNOWN VESSELS, MILITARY VESSELS MADE UP 47% (N 179) OF THE VESSELS WE IDENTIFIED WITH RADAR, FOLLOWED BY FISHING (32%; N 120) AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT (USCG) VESSELS (10%, N 38). SPATIAL ANALYSIS WAS NECESSARY TO ACCURATELY EVALUATE SHIP SPEED OVER THE ENTIRE STUDY AREA. SPATIAL ANALYSES OF THESE DATA ALLOWED US TO EXAMINE SPEED BEHAVIOR IN A GRID FORMAT, REDUCING THE EFFECT OF DIRECTIONAL BIAS FROM AN OVERREPRESENTATION OF RECORDS FROM RELATIVELY SLOW MOVING VESSELS. WITHOUT UTILIZING SPATIAL ANALYSIS, ONE COULD DRAW THE CONCLUSION THAT VESSELS WERE TRANSITING THE AREA MORE SLOWLY THAN THEY ACTUALLY WERE BECAUSE AIS SPEED RECORDS ARE SKEWED BY THE GREATER NUMBER OF SPEED POINTS FOR SLOWER VESSELS. THERE WAS AN OBVIOUS REDUCTION IN SPEED OF VESSELS TRANSMITTING AIS IN THE SHIPPING LANES FROM BEFORE TO AFTER THE SHIP STRIKE RULE THAT WAS ENACTED IN DECEMBER 2008 TO PROTECT THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC RIGHT WHALE (EUBALAENA GLACIALIS). THE SHIP STRIKE RULE IDENTIFIED A SEASONAL MANAGEMENT AREA (SMA) WITHIN WHICH COMMERCIAL SHIPS > 65 FT. IN LENGTH WERE REQUIRED TO SLOW TO 10KTS OR LESS FOR PART OF THE YEAR (50 CFR224.105). ALTHOUGH VESSELS SLOWED, MANY WERE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE MANDATORY SPEED LIMIT OF THE RULE. SPEED RESTRICTIONS HAD NO EFFECT ON VESSELS OBSERVED USING RADAR, MOST OF WHICH WERE NOT REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE REGULATIONS. CARGO SHIPS CAN BE QUITE LARGE AND TRAVEL AT SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF 20KT, AND WERE REQUIRED TO BROADCAST AIS SIGNALS, SO THEIR BEHAVIOR WAS RELATIVELY EASY TO ASSESS. FEW CARGO VESSELS TRAVELED 10KT OR LESS FOR AN ENTIRE TRANSIT THROUGH THE SMA. THUS, WE OBSERVED AN APPARENT REACTION TO THE SPEED RESTRICTIONS IN THE SMA, BUT DID NOT OBSERVE STRICT COMPLIANCE. RECENTLY THE US COAST GUARD HAS BEGUN ISSUING SPEEDING CITATIONS TO VESSELS THAT HAVE BEEN RECORDED BLATANTLY DISREGARDING THE SPEED RESTRICTIONS IN SMAS. WE APPLAUD THESE EFFORTS AND SUSPECT THAT IF THE EFFORT CONTINUES CONSISTENTLY IT WILL ENCOURAGE COMPLIANCE. OUR DATA SUGGEST THAT AIS TRAFFIC LEVELS WERE RELATIVELY CONSTANT (SIMILAR TO 1.2 TRANSITS/ HR) AROUND THE CLOCK. FOR THIS PROJECT, WE CHOSE TO OPERATE THE RADAR UNIT DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS IN ORDER TO ASSESS VESSEL TYPE AND APPROXIMATE LENGTH FROM THE SHORE BASED PLATFORM. IN THE FUTURE, WE NEED TO ASSESS RADAR VESSEL TRAFFIC DURING ALL HOURS IN ORDER TO BETTER COMPARE IT TO AIS TRAFFIC. IN 2007, VIRGINIA PORTS WERE LISTED AS THE THIRD BUSIEST PORT ON THE U. S. ATLANTIC COAST FOR VESSEL CALLS. A LARGE PORTION OF THE VESSELS CALLS FOR THE PORT OF BALTIMORE ALSO ENTER AT CHESAPEAKE BAY. THE ADDITION OF COMMERCIAL BALTIMORE TRAFFIC AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND FISHING VESSELS NOT BROADCASTING AIS VERY LIKELY MAKES THE CHESAPEAKE BAY APPROACH ONE OF THE TWO BUSIEST COASTAL PORT APPROACHES AND MAY MAKE IT THE BUSIEST IN THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC. THIS PROJECT RAISES NUMEROUS QUESTIONS ABOUT VESSEL TRAFFIC PATTERNS, VESSEL SPEEDS, RISKS TO WHALES AND DATA INCORPORATED INTO MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING EFFORTS. THERE IS A DEFINITE NEED FOR BOTH LONGER REACHING SHIP RADAR DATA AND MORE DETAILED WHALE PRESENCE DATA IN THE MID ATLANTIC REGION, ESPECIALLY OFF ITS BUSIEST PORT. WITHOUT DATA ON WHALE PRESENCE, IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF RISK THAT THE VESSEL TRAFFIC PATTERNS PRESENT FOR WHALES AND ON HOW INSTALLATIONS OF OFFSHORE WIND AND OTHER ENERGY VENTURES MAY AFFECT WHALES AND SHIPS. THIS PROJECT BRINGS INTO QUESTION THE USE OF AIS DATA ALONE AS AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF LARGE VESSEL TRAFFIC IN COASTAL REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WITH HIGH FISHING AND MILITARY TRAFFIC. IN VIRGINIA, DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS, AIS DATA REPRESENT A MAXIMUM OF TWO THIRDS, AND, AS LITTLE AS ONE HALF, OF THE LARGE VESSEL (> 65 FEET) TRAFFIC IN THE CHESAPEAKE BAY APPROACH. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE ACCURATE DETERMINATION OF VESSEL SIZE WHEN USING RADAR. A MOBILE RESEARCH PLATFORM WITH THE CAPABILITY OF ASSESSING RADAR TARGETS ON THE WATER OR AN OFFSHORE PLATFORM WITH A GREATER RANGE AND USE OF NIGHT VISION TECHNOLOGY MAY PROVIDE SOLUTIONS.	***

MOBILE COUNTY NOW HAS A TOTAL OF EIGHT REAL TIME WATER LEVEL OBSERVATORIES TO PROVIDE FULL DATA COVERAGE OF ITS COASTLINE FROM THE MISSISSIPPI STATE LINE TO CHICKASAW IN THE MOBILE RIVER DELTA AT THE NORTH END OF THE COUNTY. MBSSMN IS ALSO THE FIRST LOCAL STORM SURGE NETWORK IN THE COUNTRY TO HAVE FIVE OF ITS MONITORING STATIONS ELEVATED TO CATEGORY FIVE MODELED STORM SURGE HEIGHTS, ENSURING THE COLLECTION OF DATA WHEN IT IS NEEDED MOST CRITICALLY. THE NETWORK WILL PROVIDE DATA AND PRODUCTS THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR COASTAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ACROSS THE REGION ON AN ONGOING BASIS, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY SUPPORTING EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT DECISIONS BEFORE AND DURING THE PASSAGE OF THE MOST SEVERE EPISODIC STORM EVENTS. DUE TO CHALLENGING STATION REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITED INFRASTRUCTURE IN KEY LOCATIONS, CO OPS OPTED TO EMPLOY REMOTE RADAR RANGE SENSORS TO MEASURE WATER LEVEL. UTILIZATION OF RADAR GAUGES FOR THIS PURPOSE PROVIDED MANY OPERATIONAL ADVANTAGES. AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF TESTING, THIS RADAR SENSOR IS BEING USED OPERATIONALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME BY CO OPS, WITH EXCELLENT RESULTS AFTER ITS FIRST YEAR OF DATA COLLECTION. THE FIRST THREE MBSSMN STATIONS WERE INSTALLED ATOP STATE HIGHWAY BRIDGES IN SOUTHERN MOBILE COUNTY. THIS SETUP WAS POSSIBLE DUE TO THE RADAR WATER LEVEL SENSORS ABILITY TO MEASURE THE SEA SURFACE REMOTELY FROM ABOVE, WITH NO COMPONENTS IN CONTACT WITH THE WATER COLUMN. INSTALLATION OF THE FIRST THREE STATIONS WAS COMPLETED IN JULY 2011 AND THE FIRST STORM SURGE EVENT TO BE CAPTURED WAS DURING THE PASSAGE OF TROPICAL STORM LEE IN SEPTEMBER 2011. THE FINAL TWO STATIONS ARE ELEVATED FOUR PILE STRUCTURES THAT WERE CONSTRUCTED TO RAISE THE INSTRUMENTATION ABOVE THE MAXIMUM MODELED CATEGORY FIVE HURRICANE STORM SURGE HEIGHT (22 25 FEET ABOVE NAVD88). THIS PAPER WILL SUMMARIZE THE UNIQUE PROJECT REQUIREMENTS, COMMITTED STAKEHOLDER SUPPORT, INVENTIVE PROBLEM RESOLUTION, AND SUPERB DATA QUALITY THAT IDENTIFY THE MBSSMN AS A TEMPLATE FOR FUTURE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS OF THIS TYPE. A SUMMARY OVERVIEW OF THE WATER LEVEL STATION DESIGNS WILL BE PRESENTED ALONG WITH OBSERVATIONS COLLECTED DURING THE PASSAGE OF TROPICAL STORM LEE AND OTHER HIGH WIND SURGE EVENTS. SAMPLE WATER LEVEL DATA THAT HAVE BEEN COLLECTED ACROSS THE FIVE NETWORK STATIONS DURING STORM EVENTS PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF A SURGE EVENT IN MOBILE BAY.	***

ADDITIONALLY, WE RESPOND TO LIVE AND DEAD STRANDINGS OF CETACEAN AND PINNIPED SPECIES FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO DENSITY OR TAGGING DATA IN THE AREA, BUT WHERE WE HAVE REGULAR DOCUMENTATION OF OCCURRENCE IN THE STRANDING RECORD. COMPILING THESE DATA INTO A SINGLE SPATIAL ANALYSIS ALLOWS US TO BETTER: 1) UNDERSTAND HUMAN AND WILDLIFE USE OF AREAS, 2) PLAN FOR DEVELOPMENT, AND 3) PREDICT POTENTIAL CONFLICTS. OUR TAGGING AND SIGHTING PROJECTS CAN BE USED TO UNDERSTAND SPECIES HABITAT USE. FOR THE TAGGING DATA, WE INCLUDED A MAXIMUM OF ONE LOCATION DATA POINT PER DAY FROM FIVE SATELLITE TAGGED LOGGERHEAD SEA TURTLES (CARETTA CARETTA) FROM JULY OCTOBER IN 2011. FROM THIS ANALYSIS, WE CALCULATED THAT 71% (64 OUT OF 118) OF THE DATA POINTS WERE WITHIN 30 NM OF ONE OR MORE MID ATLANTIC WIND ENERGY AREAS (MAWEAS). DURING 2011, A TOTAL OF 14,576 KM OF AERIAL SURVEY TRANSITS RESULTED IN 1,572 SEA TURTLE SIGHTINGS, WITH 1,122 ANIMALS (71%) LOCATED WITHIN 30 NM OF THE VIRGINIA WEA. IN ADDITION, 49% (227 OUT OF 648) OF BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN (TURSIOPS TRUNCATUS) GROUP SIGHTINGS, REPRESENTING 57% (1471 OUT OF 2588) INDIVIDUAL ANIMALS, WERE WITHIN 30NM OF MAWEAS. USING PHOTO IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES, WE DOCUMENTED A MINIMUM OF 57 HUMPBACK WHALES (MEGAPTERA NOVAEANGLIAE) AND 5 FIN WHALES (BALAENOPTERA PHYSALUS) IN NEAR SHORE VIRGINIA OCEAN WATERS FROM DECEMBER 2011 THROUGH FEBRUARY 2012. ONE MAJOR CHALLENGE TO APPLYING THIS BIOLOGICAL MONITORING DATA IN MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING EFFORTS IS THE LACK OF SPATIAL DENSITY DATA FOR MARINE MAMMALS AND SEA TURTLES, PARTICULARLY ON A REGIONAL AND SEASONAL SCALE. IN THE U. S. MID ATLANTIC REGION, RELATIVELY FEW SURVEY EFFORTS HAVE OCCURRED, AND THOSE THAT WERE CONDUCTED HAVE BEEN OF SUCH BROAD SCALE THAT FEW, IF ANY, OF THE LESS COMMON SPECIES WERE SIGHTED. THESE RESULTS HAVE LED TO CALCULATED DENSITIES OF ZERO OR NEAR ZERO FOR SOME SPECIES IN A REGION WHERE ANECDOTALLY WE KNOW THAT THEY REGULARLY OCCUR. WHEN THESE DENSITIES ARE APPLIED TO MANAGEMENT DOCUMENTS, INACCURATE CONCLUSIONS MAY BE MADE REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE 2012 DRAFT PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT (DPEIS) FOR THE ATLANTIC OCS PROPOSED GEOLOGICAL AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITIES MID ATLANTIC AND SOUTH ATLANTIC PLANNING AREAS USED MARINE MAMMAL DENSITY CALCULATIONS TO MODEL MARINE MAMMAL TAKES FROM SEISMIC SURVEYS AND ASSIGN AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT MEASURE TO THE ACTION. DENSITIES WERE REPORTED FOR ALL MARINE MAMMAL SPECIES WITH HABITAT RANGES IN THE AREA. THE DPEIS IDENTIFIES ZONE 20 EXTENDING ACROSS THE CONTINENTAL SHELF FROM CAPE LOOKOUT TO THE DELAWARE BAY, INCLUDING VIRGINIA WATERS. MANY OF THE SPECIES HAVE ZERO OR NEAR ZERO REPORTED DENSITIES, BUT HAVE REGULAR PRESENCE IN VIRGINIA STRANDING AND SIGHTING RECORDS (TABLE 1). HUMPBACK WHALES AND BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS (TURSIOPS TRUNCATUS) ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST, BECAUSE BOTH OUR SIGHTING REPORTS AND OUR STRANDING DATA ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THESE DENSITIES. A SIMILAR PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED IN ANALYSES OF VERTICAL LINE AND WHALE CO OCCURRENCE THAT WAS CONDUCTED FOR THE NOAA FISHERIES ATLANTIC LARGE WHALE TAKE REDUCTION TEAM. LACK OF FORMAL SURVEY DATA FROM THE MID ATLANTIC REGION RESULTED IN A MODEL WITH LARGE AREAS OF ZERO DENSITY, DESPITE EXTENSIVE ANECDOTAL STRANDING AND SIGHTING RECORDS. WE PROPOSE THAT A METHOD FOR DETERMINING MINIMUM DENSITY SHOULD BE DEVELOPED AND UTILIZED FOR SPECIES WITH VERIFIED ANECDOTAL RECORDS, SUCH AS STRANDING DATA. THEN WE CAN BETTER MODEL ANIMAL PRESENCE, AND POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM HUMAN ACTIVITIES, FOR SPECIES WITH INADEQUATE DATA FROM FORMAL SURVEYS. THE MONITORING OF ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITY IN MARINE HABITATS IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO PREDICT THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF DEVELOPMENT TO POPULATIONS AND SPECIES. DURING OUR 2008 2009 SHIP CHARACTERIZATION STUDY, WE UTILIZED AIS TECHNOLOGY TO RECORD 323 VESSELS (18,473KM OF TRANSITS) TRAVELING THROUGH THE VIRGINIA WEA, REPRESENTING 30% OF ALL AIS RECORDED LARGE VESSEL TRAFFIC. SHIP TRAFFIC REROUTING AS A RESULT OF WIND ENERGY DEVELOPMENT COULD INCREASE THE RISK OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN WILDLIFE AND HUMAN ACTIVITY BY POTENTIALLY DISPLACING WHALES AND SHIPS INTO SMALLER, HIGHER DENSITY AREAS. COMMERCIAL FISHING AND FEDERAL VESSEL ACTIVITY ARE CURRENTLY UNREPRESENTED IN AIS DATASETS, AND SHOULD BE MONITORED AND CONSIDERED IN SPATIAL PLANNING EFFORTS IN ORDER TO HAVE A COMPLETE PICTURE OF HOW OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WILL AFFECT ALL VESSEL ACTIVITY. MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO MITIGATE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS ASSOCIATED WITH OCEAN USE ISSUES, AND BOTH BIOLOGICAL MONITORING DATA AND HUMAN USE INFORMATION ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE PROCESS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THIS ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT NON TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF DATA, IN ADDITION TO DATA FROM TRADITIONAL DENSITY SURVEYS, ARE BEING USED TO MONITOR ENDANGERED AND PROTECTED SPECIES AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE SPATIAL PLANNING PROCESS TO INFORM MANAGEMENT DECISIONS.	***

NERACOOS IS ONE OF THE ELEVEN REGIONAL ASSOCIATIONS OF THE US INTEGRATED OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM (IOOS). THE BUOYS ARE DEPLOYED AND MAINTAINED BY THE PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY GROUP OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MAINE, INITIALLY AS PART OF THE GULF OF MAINE OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM. ANALYSIS OF THIS LARGE TIMESERIES (OVER 10(5) SAMPLES FOR A SINGLE DEPTH) SHOWS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT WARMING TRENDS AT ALL DEPTHS FOR ALL LOCATIONS, PROVIDING THE FIRST DEPTH RESOLVED RATES OF TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY FOR THE U. S. EAST COAST FROM CONTINUOUS DATA. ANALYSIS STEPS INCLUDE QUALITY CONTROL OF THE DATA, CALCULATION AND AVERAGING OF DAILY MEANS AND ANOMALIES, ACCORDING TO THE DECORRELATION TIMESCALE (SIMILAR TO 20 DAYS) AND CALCULATION OF RATES OF CHANGE WITH LINEAR REGRESSION. USE OF THE DECORRELATION TIMESCALE ALLOWS FOR OPTIMAL DETERMINATION OF ERRORS BY ASSESSING THE NUMBER OF UNIQUE SAMPLES WITHIN THE LARGE DATASET, IN WHICH OBSERVATIONS ARE CLOSELY CORRELATED TO ADJACENT RECORDS. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY AND TIME (P<0.05), AND ALL RATES OF CHANGE ARE POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05), ALTHOUGH THE TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY EXPLAINED BY TIME ALONE IS LOW (AVERAGE 12%). WARMING RATES ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH DEPTH; THE GREATEST RATES ARE OBSERVED MID WATER COLUMN AT THE DEEPEST LOCATIONS. LONG TERM HISTORICAL TIME SERIES INDICATE THAT BETWEEN 1940 AND 1950 THE GULF OF MAINE WARMED AT APPROXIMATELY 0.25 DEGREES C YR( 1), FOLLOWED BY OVER A DECADE OF COOLING AT A SIMILAR RATE, ALL SUPERIMPOSED ON AN OVERALL WARMING TREND OF 0.01 DEGREES C YR( 1). THE PERIOD OF RAPID WARMING RECORDED BY THE NERACOOS BUOYS SINCE 2004, OF SIMILAR MAGNITUDE TO THE 1940 50 WARMING TREND, MAY REPRESENT ANOTHER CYCLE OF DECADAL VARIABILITY OR PERHAPS INDICATE A SHIFT IN THE LONG TERM WARMING TREND. IF CURRENT WARMING TRENDS CONTINUE, THE GULF OF MAINE ECOSYSTEM IS PROJECTED TO UNDERGO A TRANSITION IN SPECIES COMPOSITION AND FOOD WEB STRUCTURE. DIRECT EFFECTS OF WARMING INCLUDE CHANGES IN THERMAL HABITAT (AFFECTING GROWTH, MOLTING AND REPRODUCTION CYCLES) AND SPECIES SHIFTS IN LOCAL SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND BIOGEOGRAPHIC RANGE. WHILE THE TRANSITION STATES AND THEIR TIMING CANNOT BE WELL PREDICTED, THE PRESENT UNDERSTANDING POINTS TO PARTICULAR IMPACTS ON A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT SPECIES THAT RESIDE AT THE SOUTHERN EXTENT OF THEIR BIOGEOGRAPHIC RANGE IN THE GULF OF MAINE. THE DIFFICULTY IN PREDICTION OF ECOSYSTEM STATES AND IMPACTS REINFORCES THE NEED TO OBSERVE NOT ONLY TEMPERATURE AND HYDROGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, BUT ALSO LOWER LEVEL ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY, DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF KEY DOMINANT SPECIES IN THE COASTAL ZONE, AN AREA NOT WELL OBSERVED BY CURRENT SAMPLING STRATEGIES. SUSTAINED HIGH TEMPORAL FREQUENCY, FIXED LOCATION TIME SERIES ARE CRITICAL TO DETECTION OF PHYSICAL VARIABILITY IN AS SHORT A TIMEFRAME AS POSSIBLE. WITHOUT COMPARABLE SAMPLING OF ECOLOGICAL VARIABILITY, WE WILL NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR TIMELY DETECTION OF ECOSYSTEM RESPONSES. KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXTENT OF CHANGE IN THE GULF OF MAINE COASTAL ECOSYSTEM WILL CONTRIBUTE TO INFORMED DECISIONS FOR ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF GULF OF MAINE ECOSYSTEM RESOURCES.	***

WE SUMMARIZE THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE OF METEOROLOGICALLY FORCED HIGH WATER LEVEL ANOMALIES IN LONG ISLAND SOUND USING ARCHIVED SEA LEVEL RECORDS. WE THEN EXPLAIN THE SPATIAL VARIATION OF THE RETURN INTERVAL FOR ANOMALIES RESULTING FROM EXTRA TROPICAL (NOREASTERS) AND TROPICAL (HURRICANES) CYCLONES. EXTRA TROPICAL CYCLONES GENERATE MUCH LARGER SEA LEVEL ANOMALIES IN THE WESTERN SOUND BECAUSE THE LOCALLY GENERATED SETUP AUGMENTS THE SHELF RESPONSE. AS A RESULT, 2M ANOMALIES DUE TO NOREASTERS HAVE A RETURN PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY A DECADE IN THE WESTERN SOUND AND A CENTURY IN THE EASTERN SOUND. HURRICANES ARE INFREQUENT AND AFFECT NEW ENGLAND IN THE LATE SUMMER. THE DIRECTION OF THE WINDS THEY INDUCE AND THEIR RAPID TRANSLATION SPEEDS DO NOT LEAD TO THE SAME SUPERPOSITION OF EFFECTS; THEREFORE, STATISTICS OF SEA LEVEL EXTREMES IN THE SUMMER ARE SIMILAR THROUGHOUT THE SOUND. THE RETURN PERIOD FOR A 2M SURGE DUE TO A HURRICANE IS APPROXIMATELY A CENTURY. SINCE LARGER ANOMALIES OCCUR MUCH MORE FREQUENTLY IN THE WESTERN SOUND THAN THE EAST, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE COASTAL COMMUNITIES IN THE EAST ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO HURRICANE INDUCED SURGES. FURTHER, SINCE SEA LEVEL RISE WILL HAVE A GREATER IMPACT ON THE RETURN PERIODS OF LARGE SURGES IN THE EASTERN SOUND THE VULNERABILITY WILL INCREASE.	***

THE VISIBILITY AND VISUAL CONTRAST OF OFFSHORE WIND FACILITIES DEPEND ON COMPLEX INTERACTIONS AMONG FACILITY SIZE, TURBINE SIZE AND COLOR, DISTANCE FROM SHORE, LIGHTING, AND WEATHER AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT OVERALL VISIBILITY. HOWEVER, LITTLE SYSTEMIC STUDY OF VISIBILITY AND VISUAL CONTRAST OF OFFSHORE WIND FACILITIES IN REAL SEASCAPE SETTINGS HAS BEEN CONDUCTED. AS A RESULT, THERE IS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF OFFSHORE WIND FACILITIES ON SENSITIVE VISUAL RESOURCE AREAS IN COASTAL REGIONS, SUCH AS NATIONAL SEASHORES, HISTORIC SITES, AND TRAIL CORRIDORS. AS PART OF A RESEARCH STUDY SPONSORED BY THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIORS BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT, AN ASSESSMENT OF THE VISIBILITY AND VISUAL CONTRAST OF 11 UTILITY SCALE OFFSHORE WIND FACILITIES WAS CONDUCTED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER OF 2011. THE OBSERVED FACILITIES RANGED FROM 25 TO 140 TURBINES AND WERE LOCATED WITHIN 5.5 52.0 KM (3.4 32.3 MI) OF 29 COASTAL VIEWPOINTS. TURBINE POWER OUTPUT RANGED FROM 2.0 TO 5.0 MW, WITH BLADE TIP HEIGHTS RANGING FROM 113.5 TO 153 M (372 TO 502 FT). STUDY OBJECTIVES INCLUDED IDENTIFYING THE MAXIMUM DISTANCES AT WHICH THE FACILITIES COULD BE SEEN FROM THE COASTAL VIEWPOINTS IN BOTH DAYTIME AND NIGHT TIME VIEWS AND ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF DISTANCE ON THE DEGREE OF VISUAL CONTRAST ASSOCIATED WITH THE FACILITIES. OBSERVERS INCLUDED A LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT, A GEOSPATIAL VISUALIZATION DEVELOPER, AND AN ARCHAEOLOGIST. FOR EACH FACILITY, THE OBSERVERS RECORDED DATA ABOUT WEATHER AND LIGHTING CONDITIONS, PHOTOGRAPHED THE FACILITIES AT DIFFERENT FOCAL LENGTHS, AND USED A NUMERIC SCALE TO ASSESS THE FACILITIES DEGREE OF VISIBILITY. A TOTAL OF 48 DAYTIME OBSERVATIONS OF 11 OFFSHORE WIND FACILITIES WERE MADE, AND AN ADDITIONAL 6 OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE AT NIGHT. WEATHER AND VISIBILITY CONDITIONS VARIED WIDELY DURING THE 10 DAY FIELD STUDY. IN THE COURSE OF THIS STUDY, UNDER FAVORABLE BUT NOT EXCEPTIONAL VIEWING CONDITIONS, MODERATE SIZED OFFSHORE WIND FACILITIES WERE FREQUENTLY FOUND TO BE VISIBLE AT DISTANCES EXCEEDING 21 MI (34 KM); THEY WERE VISIBLE AT A MAXIMUM DISTANCE OF 43 KM (27 MI), AS SEEN FROM AN ELEVATED VIEWPOINT. WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, REGARDLESS OF FACILITY SIZE OR LIGHTING CONDITIONS, ON DAYS WITH GOOD VISIBILITY, OFFSHORE WIND FACILITIES WERE JUDGED TO BE MAJOR FOCI OF VISUAL ATTENTION AT DISTANCES OF 16 KM (10 MI) OR LESS, SUGGESTING POTENTIALLY HIGH LEVELS OF VISUAL IMPACT FOR SENSITIVE VIEWERS. SMALLER WIND FACILITIES (25 48 TURBINES) WERE GENERALLY JUDGED TO BE EASILY VISIBLE AT DISTANCES OF 23 24 KM (14 15 MI). LARGER OFFSHORE WIND FACILITIES (100 OR MORE TURBINES) WERE JUDGED LIKELY TO BE SEEN EASILY BY CASUAL OBSERVERS AS FAR AWAY AS 29 KM (18 MI), AND WERE VISIBLE WITH EXTENDED OR CONCENTRATED VIEWING AT DISTANCES GREATER THAN 40 KM (25 MI). THAT THESE DISTANCES ARE GREATER THAN THOSE REPORTED IN PREVIOUS STUDIES IS LIKELY A FUNCTION OF THE LONG TERM TREND TOWARD LARGER OFFSHORE WIND FACILITIES WITH MORE AND LARGER TURBINES THAN THOSE ASSESSED IN PREVIOUS STUDIES. TURBINE BLADE MOVEMENT WAS VISIBLE IN 42 OF THE 49 DAYTIME OBSERVATIONS, AT DISTANCES AS GREAT AS 42 KM (26 MI) AS SEEN FROM AN ELEVATED VIEWPOINT, AND WAS OBSERVED ROUTINELY AT DISTANCES OF 34 KM (21 MI) OR LESS. AT NIGHT, AERIAL HAZARD NAVIGATION LIGHTING WAS VISIBLE AT DISTANCES GREATER THAN 39 KM (24 MI). THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT AS COUNTRIES BEGIN SITING OFFSHORE WIND FACILITIES WITH HUNDREDS OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF LARGE WIND TURBINES, THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR IMPACTS ON SENSITIVE VISUAL RESOURCES IN COASTAL AREAS AT GREATER DISTANCES THAN PAST STUDIES HAVE INDICATED.	***

THIS PAPER REPORTS ON SEA CUCUMBER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT USING A DIGITAL DIARY SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED. AT RUMOI, WHICH IS LOCATED IN WESTERN HOKKAIDO, FISHING FOR SEA CUCUMBER IS CARRIED OUT IN THE SUMMER EACH YEAR BY DREDGE NET FISHING. ALTHOUGH FISHING FOR SEA CUCUMBER HAS BEEN CONDUCTED FOR OVER 30 YEARS, SINCE 2003 THE PRICE OF SEA CUCUMBER HAS RISEN SHARPLY DUE TO GROWING DEMAND IN CHINA, AND THERE ARE CONCERNS OVER SEA CUCUMBER DEPLETION DUE TO THE RAPID INCREASE IN CATCH SIZES. DURING THE FISHING SEASONS FROM 2007 TO 2009, WE ESTIMATED RESOURCE AMOUNTS BY USING THE SWEPT AREA METHOD BY FITTING DATA LOGGERS THAT RECORD GPS POSITION INFORMATION TO 3 VESSELS FROM AMONG THE TOTAL OF 16 SEA CUCUMBER DREDGE NET FISHING VESSELS IN RUMOI AND MATCHED THE VESSEL TRAJECTORIES WITH FISHING DIARIES WRITTEN IN NOTEPADS BY THE FISHERS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT SEA CUCUMBER RESOURCES WERE DECREASING YEAR BY YEAR. WE THEN DEVELOPED A REAL TIME FISHERY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WITH THE AIM OF ALLOWING THE FISHERS THEMSELVES TO PERFORM AUTONOMOUS RESOURCE MANAGEMENT BY USING ESTIMATES OF THE RESOURCE AMOUNT. THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF A DIGITAL DIARY SYSTEM AND A VESSEL MONITORING SYSTEM. BOTH OF THESE SYSTEM COMPONENTS ARE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET VIA MOBILE PHONE LINES, WITH FISHING OPERATION INFORMATION AND CATCH INFORMATION FROM THE DIGITAL DIARY SYSTEM AND POSITION INFORMATION FROM THE VESSEL MONITORING SYSTEM COLLECTED ON A SERVER IN REAL TIME. IN 2012, THE FISHERY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WAS INSTALLED ON ALL 16 VESSELS, WITH REAL TIME RESOURCE ESTIMATES CARRIED OUT ON A WEEKLY BASIS. THE FISHERS WORKED TOWARD AUTONOMOUS RESOURCE MANAGEMENT WHERE THEY DECIDED THE RESOURCE AMOUNT TO LEAVE BEHIND, AND USED THE DIFFERENCE FROM THE ESTIMATED RESOURCE AMOUNT AS THE PERMISSIBLE CATCH LIMIT FOR THAT YEAR. FURTHERMORE, THE SHARING OF POSITION INFORMATION USING THE VESSEL MONITORING SYSTEM ENABLED EFFICIENT UTILIZATION OF THE FISHING GROUNDS AND COORDINATION OF FISHING OPERATIONS. THE FISHERS CLOSED THE FISHING SEASON EARLY BASED ON VARIATIONS IN THE CATCH PER UNIT EFFORT THAT WAS UPDATED IN REAL TIME AS AN INDICATOR. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SEA CUCUMBER RESOURCE AMOUNT WAS MAINTAINED AND DEMONSTRATE THE USEFULNESS OF THE DEVELOPED REAL TIME FISHERY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.	***

THE COMBINATION OF SEA LEVEL RISE AND POPULATION GROWTH IN COASTAL REGIONS MAKES IT ESSENTIAL TO CONTINUE IMPROVING FLOOD MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO MODEL AND COMPARE THE IMPACT OF SEA LEVEL RISE ON THE FREQUENCY OF INUNDATION FOR TWO FLORIDA LOCATIONS, PENSACOLA AND KEY WEST. THE RESEARCH IS BASED ON DATA FROM THESE TWO STATIONS THAT BENEFIT FROM EXISTING LONG TERM SEA LEVEL RECORDS, HAVE SIMILAR RELATIVE SEA LEVEL RISE TRENDS, BUT DIFFERENT SURGE HISTORIES AND BATHYMETRY. PENSACOLA IS A SEA PORT ON PENSACOLA BAY, WHICH JOINS THE GULF OF MEXICO. WATER LEVEL RECORDS MEASURED HOURLY ARE AVAILABLE STARTING IN JANUARY 1924 TILL PRESENT. THE KEY WEST STATION IS LOCATED AT THE SOUTHERNMOST POINT OF FLORIDA. THE STATIONS RECORDS ARE AVAILABLE STARTING IN JANUARY 1913 TILL PRESENT AND INCLUDE WATER LEVELS MEASURED HOURLY. BOTH AREAS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY HURRICANES. HURRICANE WILMA IN 2005 WAS THE LAST MAJOR STORM TO IMPACT KEY WEST, WHILE HURRICANE IVAN IN 2004 AND HURRICANE KATRINA IN 2005 WERE THE LAST HURRICANES TO IMPACT PENSACOLA. PREVIOUS WORK IDENTIFIED THE GENERAL EXTREME VALUE (GEV) DISTRIBUTION AS AN APPROPRIATE MODEL FOR SURGES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. ENSEMBLES OF SURGE MODELS ARE COMPUTED BASED ON THE 99 YEAR RECORD OF KEY WEST, FLORIDA AND THE 88 YEAR RECORD OF PENSACOLA, FLORIDA. THE EXTREME SURGE DISTRIBUTIONS ARE THEN COMBINED WITH SEA LEVEL RISE PROJECTIONS TO ESTIMATE FUTURE WATER LEVEL EXCEEDANCE PROBABILITIES. INCREASES IN INUNDATION FREQUENCIES ARE COMPUTED BASED ON TWO POSSIBLE SEA LEVEL RISE SCENARIOS, A CONSERVATIVE LINEAR CONTINUATION OF THE PAST CENTURYS TREND AND A SCENARIO BASED ON THE UPPER LIMIT OF THE SEA LEVEL RANGE IN THE IPCC AR4 REPORT, I.E. THE A1FI SCENARIO. THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH SURGES CLIMATIC VARIABILITY IS INVESTIGATED USING A BOOTSTRAP TECHNIQUE. THE BOOTSTRAP IS USED TO ESTIMATE 90% AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS AROUND THE ESTIMATED PROPORTIONAL CHANGE IN WATER LEVEL EXCEEDANCE PROBABILITIES FOR VARYING SURGES FOR THESE TWO SEA LEVEL RISE SCENARIOS. VERTICAL LAND MOTION, GLOBAL SEA LEVEL RISE, AND TIDAL AND ATMOSPHERIC FORCINGS ARE CONSIDERED SEPARATELY. THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE PROJECTIONS OF THE PROBABILITIES OF INUNDATION DEFER SIGNIFICANTLY. THE RELATIVE INCREASES IN THE ESTIMATED PROBABILITIES REACH THEIR MAXIMUM FOR DIFFERENT WATER LEVELS: 0.43 M FOR THE KEY WEST STATION AND AT 0.64 M FOR THE PENSACOLA STATION ASSUMING A CONTINUATION OF LAST CENTURYS RATE OF SEA LEVEL RISE. BY THE END OF THE CENTURY THE FREQUENCY OF EXCEEDING WATER LEVELS OF 0.43 M IS PROJECTED TO INCREASE AT LEAST BY 5 TIMES FOR STATION KEY WEST, BUT ONLY BY 2 FOR 0.64 M WATER LEVEL FOR STATION PENSACOLA, WITH VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 90% AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. THE DIFFERENCES IN WATER LEVEL EXCEEDANCE PROBABILITIES ARE DISCUSSED AND ASSOCIATED WITH THE STATISTICAL PARAMETERS OF THE DISTRIBUTIONS, LOCAL COASTAL SETTINGS AND SURGE HISTORIES. THE PROBABILITY OF WATER LEVELS EXCEEDING THE LEVELS ASSOCIATED WITH HURRICANE WILMA IN 2005 (ONE OF THE MOST DEVASTATING HURRICANES IN THE HISTORY OF FLORIDA KEYS) MAY TRIPLE BY THE END OF THE CENTURY FOR THE MORE CONSERVATIVE SEA LEVEL RISE SCENARIO.	***

IN ALL INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES, THIS COMPLEXITY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON THE WELFARE OF CITIZENS, SOCIAL ORGANIZATION, ECONOMY AND TERRITORIAL SECURITY. IN FACT, A PARTIAL OR TOTAL DETRIMENT OF THE NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS CAPACITY CAN HAVE A DEBILITATING IMPACT ON SOCIETY, ON DEFENSE AND SECURITY BOTH LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY FOR THE DOMINO EFFECT. OBVIOUSLY, IF THE CITIES ARE DENSELY POPULATED THIS PROBLEM IS AMPLIFIED. FINALLY, THE INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN NETWORKS AND URBAN SYSTEM IS MADE POSSIBLE BY THE RAPID GROWTH AND INTEGRATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS. IF THIS HAS IMPROVED THE LIVES OF CITIZENS, HAS ALSO MADE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM MORE DELICATE AND VULNERABLE. TO MITIGATE THIS RISK PROFILE AND OPTIMIZING THE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION ACTIONS AND TO COUNTERACT THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH EVENTS, THERE ARE SOME KEY ELEMENTS: I) MONITORING AND CONTROL OF INFRASTRUCTURES AND TERRITORY, II) THE ADOPTION OF APPROPRIATE EMERGENCY AND CONTINGENCY PLANS, III) THE INCREASING THE RESILIENCE, IV) THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SECURITY POLICIES FOR PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP BUT OVERALL, V) THE PROPER MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ACHIEVE A HOLISTIC, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL APPROACH DURING CRISIS OR EMERGENCIES. TO ACHIEVE THIS NEW WAY TO DEAL WITH THE CRISIS/EMERGENCY EVENT, WE MUST TAKE BOTH A TECHNOLOGICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE AND EVOLUTION OF THE GENERAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE SYSTEM. SO WE CAN BUILT AN HOMOGENOUS AND COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT THAT ALLOW US TO CREATE AN INSTITUTIONAL, GEOGRAPHICAL, TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL CONNECTIVITY AND THE CONCRETIZATION OF A RATIONAL, CONSISTENT AND INTEROPERABLE RESPONSE. THEREFORE, WE NEED TO BUILT A INTEGRATED CHAIN OF ACQUISITION, ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OF DATA AND INFORMATION COMING FROM THE ENTIRE TERRITORY PASSING THROUGH THE USE OF AN INTEGRATION STRATEGY AMONG SPACE, AIRBORNE AND GROUND DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEMS. IN THIS WAY, WE CAN ACHIEVE A HIGH LEVEL OF DETAIL. THIS IS ALLOWED BECAUSE THE DATA, THE INFORMATION AND IMAGES OF THE EVENT, MAY NOT ONLY BE MANIPULATED, ANALYZED AND DISPLAYED, BUT ALSO CONVERTED AND USED AS DATA INPUT TO SYSTEM SUCH AS GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS) AND COMMON OPERATIONAL PICTURE (COP). SO, THE DECISION MAKERS CAN GET AN OVERVIEW OF OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK OF THE EVENT AND MAY ALSO SHARE THIS VISION WITH DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS, STRUCTURES AND ORGANIZATIONS. THEY CAN BE SUPPORTED IN THE CHARACTERIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CRISIS OR EMERGENCY AND ALSO IN COLLABORATIVE PLANNING.	***

THE MUNICIPALITY OF BANI IN THE PROVINCE OF PANGASINAN CONSIDERS FRL AS A FEASIBLE STRATEGY TO SUPPORT THE SUSTAINABLE USE OF ITS MUNICIPAL FISHERIES RESOURCES. SPEARHEADED BY THE OFFICE OF THE MUNICIPAL AGRICULTURIST (OMAG), BANI INITIALLY IMPLEMENTED AN FRL SYSTEM AT THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL. THERE WAS VERY LOW COMPLIANCE UNDER THIS SYSTEM PRIMARILY BECAUSE FISHER FOLK FROM FAR FLUNG VILLAGES WERE UNABLE TO AFFORD THE HIGH TRANSPORTATION COSTS OF GOING TO THE TOWN CENTER TO REGISTER. IN RESPONSE, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OF BANI DEVOLVED FISHERIES REGISTRATION TO THE VILLAGE LEVEL. THROUGH EXECUTIVE ORDER #03 ENACTED BY THE MUNICIPAL MAYOR IN 2006, VILLAGE OFFICIALS WERE MOBILIZED TO IMPLEMENT FRL SYSTEMS IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS. TO BUILD THEIR CAPABILITY TO UNDERTAKE SUCH, THEY WERE TRAINED BY THE OMAG WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE SAGIP LINGAYEN GULF PROJECT. BASED ON THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS, DEVOLVING FRL TO THE VILLAGE LEVEL HAS DECREASED IMPLEMENTATION COST AND HAS ALSO SHORTENED THE FRL CYCLE. COMPLIANCE RATES FROM 2003 TO 2007 REVEALED THAT THE DEVOLVED SYSTEM HAS ALSO BEEN EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF REGISTRANTS. THE DEVOLVED SYSTEM IS ALSO CREDITED WITH HAVING FACILITATED EASY AND MORE RELIABLE MONITORING OF FISHING ACTIVITIES GIVEN THE PROXIMITY OF VILLAGE ENFORCERS TO FISHER FOLK. POLICY WISE, MORE EFFECTIVE MONITORING RESULTED IN MORE ACCURATE, VALID AND TIMELY DATA INPUTTING INTO THE MUNICIPALITYS SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES REGULATION AND MANAGEMENT DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM. TO DATE, NOT ALL COASTAL MUNICIPALITIES/CITIES IN THE COUNTRY ARE IMPLEMENTING AN FRL SYSTEM, DESPITE ITS CRUCIAL ROLE IN SUSTAINABLE COASTAL GOVERNANCE AND IN CONFERRING PRIORITY RIGHTS TO MUNICIPAL FISHERIES RESOURCES TO LOCAL FISHER FOLK. GIVEN ITS MERITS, THE BANI EXPERIENCE IN DEVOLVING FRL COULD SERVE AS A MODEL THAT MAY BE REPLICATED IN OTHER AREAS IN THE PHILIPPINES WITH THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC CONFIGURATION. (C) 2012 THE AUTHORS.

THE HEAVY METALS CANNOT BE DECOMPOSED BUT CAN BE TRANSFERRED AND ACCUMULATED WITH FOOD CHAINS [1, 2]. MANY HEAVY METALS ARE TOXIC TO HUMAN BEINGS. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MEASURE THE HEAVY METAL CONCENTRATION IN THE COASTAL WATERS FOR WATER QUALITY INVESTIGATION, ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND FOR SECURITY OF AQUACULTURE PRODUCTS. THE REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED FOR ESTIMATION OF MANY PARAMETERS OF WATER QUALITY, SUCH AS THE SUSPENDED SEDIMENTS [3], CHLOROPHYLL A, [4 6], CDOM (COLORED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER) [7 8], EUTROPHICATION [9 10], SALINITY [11], AND WATER QUALITY GRADES [12]. THE REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGY HAS MANY ADVANTAGES OVER THE CONVENTIONAL INVESTIGATION OF WATER QUALITY FOR ITS HIGH SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION, LOW COST, BIG COVERAGE OF DATA AND SYNCHRONIZATION. WITH ITS DEVELOPMENT, THE REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUE IS EXPECTED TO RETRIEVE MORE PARAMETERS OF WATER QUALITY. AS THE HEAVY METALS IN WATER EXIST IN THREE FORMS[13 14], EACH OF WHICH IS RESPECTIVELY CONTROLLED BY OPTICALLY SIGNIFICANT PARAMETERS, SUSPENDED SEDIMENTS, DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTERS AND PHYTOPLANKTON. PREVIOUS WORK SHOWED THE POSSIBILITY OF DETECTING HEAVY METAL CONCENTRATION FROM REMOTE SENSING DATA[15]. EIGHT CRUISES WERE CONDUCTED FOR IN SITU DATA COLLECTION IN THE PEARL RIVER ESTUARY IN AUGUST, OCTOBER, NOVEMBER, DECEMBER 2009 AND FEBRUARY, MARCH, JULY AND OCTOBER 2010, RESPECTIVELY. AN ABOVE WATER METHOD WAS USED FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF REMOTE SENSING REFLECTANCE (RRS). THE WATER LEAVING RADIANCE, THE RADIANCE REFLECTED BY A REFERENCE PANEL WITH 25% REFLECTANCE AND THE SKY RADIANCE WERE MEASURED IN TURN FOR 3 TIMES USING THE OCEAN OPTICS USB4000 SPECTROMETER (WAVELENGTH RANGE FROM 346 TO 1037 NM WITH A SPECTRAL RESOLUTION OF 0.22 NM) AT 128 SAMPLING POINTS, WHERE THE WATER SAMPLES WERE SYNCHRONOUSLY COLLECTED FOR LAB ANALYSIS OF CONCENTRATION FOR THREE HEAVY METALS (CU, PB AND ZN) AND OTHER WATER COMPONENTS (SUSPENDED SEDIMENTS, CHLOROPHYLL A AND CDOM). THE IN SITU MEASURED RRS DATA WERE CALCULATED TO MATCH THE BANDS OF EO 1 HYPERION AND THE LANDSAT TM BAND 1 TO 4. THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE CONCENTRATION OF THE THREE HEAVY METALS (CU, PB AND ZN) AND THE REMOTE SENSING REFLECTANCE WERE ANALYSED. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT ALL THE THREE HEAVY METALS HAVE GOOD CORRELATIVE RELATION WITH RRS DATA. THE CORRELATIVE RELATION COULD BE IMPROVED IF IT WAS ANALYZED RESPECTIVELY FROM DATA COLLECTED IN DRY SEASON OR WET SEASON, AND THE CORRELATIVE RELATION COULD BE IMPROVED WITH THE BAND RATIO OF RRS. ALGORITHMS FOR ESTIMATION OF HEAVY METAL CONCENTRATION WERE DEVELOPED USING THE RATIO BAND COMBINATION, WHICH HAS THE MAXIMUM CORRELATIVE COEFFICIENT WITH HEAVY METALS. THEN THE ALGORITHMS WERE APPLIED TO LANDSAT TM DATA FOR ESTIMATION OF THE HEAVY METALS (CU, PB, ZN) CONCENTRATION. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE THREE HEAVY METALS CONCENTRATION IS REASONABLE.	***

THE MAIN RESULTS SHOW THAT COUPLING WINTER TO SUMMER OPTICAL MULTISPECTRAL IMAGERY ALLOWS DISCRIMINATING INVASIVE (SPARTINA ANGLICA) FROM ENDEMIC (SPARTINA MARITIMA) LOWER SALT MARSH VEGETATION SPECIES. ALSO, THE BOTTOM COLOR AND HENCEFORTH SEDIMENT MINERALOGY LARGELY INFLUENCES THE DETERMINATION OF SEAGRASS MEADOWS COVER. IN ADDITION, PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW THE POTENTIAL OF IDENTIFYING BIOFILMS OVER SANDY TO MUDDY SAND.

AMELIORATING THE INCIDENCE OF SUCH EVENTS REQUIRES AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW HARMFUL TAXA RESPOND TO DIFFERENT N SOURCES. IN PARTICULAR, THE BLOOMS OF TOXIC HETEROSIGMA HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO CAUSE COSTLY AND HIGHLY DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS TO SURROUNDING ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION. THE THREAT IS ESPECIALLY DIRE IN THE CASE OF SINGAPORE WHERE GROWTH DYNAMICS OF HETEROSIGMA SPECIES UNDER TROPICAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. THE PRESENT STUDY EXAMINED HOW THE GROWTH RATES OF HETEROSIGMA SPECIES ISOLATED FROM THE JOHOR STRAITS OF SINGAPORE DIFFER UNDER VARIOUS N SOURCES AS WELL AS VARYING LIGHT INTENSITY. HETEROSIGMA WAS FOUND TO GROW WELL UNDER BOTH NITROGEN SOURCES, BUT GREW AT A FASTER RATE WHEN EXPOSED TO NITRATE COMPARED TO AMMONIUM. IN ADDITION, THE STUDY ALSO OBSERVED TOLERANCE FOR HIGH AND LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT PRESENT MODIFICATIONS TO THE COASTAL ENVIRONMENT THROUGH HIGH SEDIMENTATION AND NUTRIENT POLLUTION RATES MIGHT BE CREATING CONDITIONS CONDUCIVE TO THE GROWTH OF HETEROSIGMA.	***

NOMOS CONSISTS OF SEVERAL SUBSYSTEMS: POMOS, GALATA, SHKORPILOVTCI, BULSEAL AND BULARGO. POMOS IS AN OBSERVING SYSTEM LOCATED IN THE PORTS (14 MEASURING SITES, 45 INSTRUMENTS, 14 WEATHER AND SEASTATE PARAMETERS), DESIGNED TO PROVIDE WEATHER AND SEA STATE OPERATIONAL INFORMATION FOR THE AREAS OF MAJOR BULGARIAN PORTS (VARNA, BURGAS AND BALCHIK), INTENDED TO SECURE SAFETY SHIPPING IN PORTS, CANALS AND BAYS. GALATA IS A PLATFORM WHICH PROVIDES OPEN SEA REAL TIME METEOROLOGICAL AND OCEANOGRAPHIC INFORMATION FROM 24 SENSORS, MEASURING 31 MAJOR OCEANOGRAPHIC AND METEOROLOGICAL PARAMETERS. SHKORPILOVTCI IS A COASTAL OCEANOGRAPHIC STATION COMPILING: WEATHER STATION, SEA LEVEL GAUGE, UV RADIATION SENSOR AND RECORDING DOPPLER CURRENT PROFILER WITH WAVE SENSOR. BULSEAL IS A NETWORK OF SEA LEVEL STATIONS INCLUDING FOUR HISTORICAL SITES, MEASURING SEA LEVEL FROM MORE THAN 80 YEARS. BULARGO IS A SET OF ARGO FLOATS DEPLOYED IN THE FRAME IF THE PROJECT SUPPORTED BY BULGARIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE FUND, MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, YOUTH AND SCIENCE. THE PURPOSE OF THE BULARGO PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A NEW NATIONAL MARINE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE FOR IN SITU OBSERVATION IN BLACK SEA BASED ON AUTONOMOUS PROFILING FLOATS AS A BULGARIAN COMPONENT OF THE EURO ARGO NETWORK. THESE SUBSYSTEMS COLLECT REAL TIME DATA USING VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS AND SENSORS PLACED AT DIFFERENT STRATEGIC LOCATIONS. ALL INSTRUMENTS ARE CONNECTED TO COMMUNICATION SYSTEM VIA INTRANET WHICH PROVIDES DIRECT ACCESS TO THE SENSORS. THE MEASURED DATA ARE TRANSMITTED TO THE CENTRAL COLLECTING SYSTEM, WHERE THE INFORMATION IS PROCESSED AND STORED IN DATABASE. ACCESS TO DATABASE IS THROUGH INTERNET/INTRANET WITH THE HELP OF BROWSERS. ACTUAL DATA IS CONTROLLED BY DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AN CAN BE DISPLAYED ON THE COMPUTER SCREENS USING REPORT SERVER SUPPORTING THEREBY NEEDS OF DIFFERENT GROUP OF USERS. NEXT FUTURE DEVELOPMENT WILL BE TO INSTALL NEW SYSTEM WHICH INCLUDES FIVE OPEN SEA MOORINGS EQUIPPED WITH METEOROLOGICAL AND OCEANOGRAPHIC SENSORS AS WELL AS WITH SEISMOMETERS AS A MAIN COMPONENT OF A MARINE HAZARDS EARLY WARNING SYSTEM. THE MAIN GOAL OF NOMOS IS TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BULGARIAN BLACK SEA COAST AND EEZ, AND THE MAIN TASK IS TO PROVIDE OPERATIONAL INFORMATION FOR THE NEEDS OF: NATIONAL SECURITY, CIVIL PROTECTION, SEARCH AND RESCUE, GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES, PORT AUTHORITIES, SHIPPING, MARINE INDUSTRY, FISHERY AND AQUACULTURE, TOURIST INDUSTRY, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, COAST PROTECTION, OIL SPILLS COMBAT AND OTHER INTERESTED. NOMOS REAL TIME DATA IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SOURCES OF MULTI PARAMETER OPERATIONAL INFORMATION IN THE BLACK SEA WHICH WILL SERVE FOR MONITORING, VERIFICATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF MODEL RESULTS AND FORECASTS AS WELL AS FOR COLLECTING LONG TIME SERIES OF DATA NEEDED FOR CLIMATIC RESEARCH, MARINE PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY. FREE REAL TIME DATA ACCESS AND DEVELOPED USER FRIENDLY WEB AND WAP INTERFACES MADE THE SYSTEM USEFUL NOT ONLY FOR SCIENCE, MARINE INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES BUT ALSO FOR GENERAL PUBLIC, ESPECIALLY FOR YACHTSMEN AND WINDSURFERS.	***

THEY ARE USED AS A POSSIBLE TOOL FOR FISHERIES MANAGEMENT IN MAXIMIZING RESOURCE ENHANCEMENT, RESOURCE CONSERVATION, HABITAT REHABILITATION AND MITIGATING AS WELL AS ONE OF THE STEPS TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM OF DEPLETING FISH RESOURCES IN THE COASTAL WATERS. THIS PAPER OUTLINE THE HISTORICAL AND THE RECENT TREND ON DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF ARTIFICIAL REEFS (ARS) PROGRAM IN MALAYSIA WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT BY FOUR MAIN DEPARTMENTS IE. THE DEPARTMENT OF FISHERIES MALAYSIA (DOFM), FISHERIES DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY BOARD OF MALAYSIA (FDAM), MARINE PARK DEPARTMENT (MPD) AND THE MALAYSIAN MARITIME ENFORCEMENT AGENCY (MMEA). A STUDY TO UNDERSTAND THE DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES IN ARS TECHNOLOGY ESPECIALLY IN THE DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, INSTALLATION, MATERIAL USED, WHERE THESE CHANGES WERE CAUSED BY PAST MANAGEMENT POLICY ON ARS DEVELOPMENT WAS DONE. DATA AND INFORMATION THAT WAS GATHERED FROM PAST PUBLISHED AND UNPUBLISHED PAPERS/TECHNICAL REPORTS/ANNUAL REPORTS MOSTLY WRITTEN BY OFFICERS AND RESEARCHERS WERE REVIEWED TO SUPPORT THE STUDY. INITIAL MONITORING ON THE FISH CATCHES USING THE LATEST DESIGN OF THE ARTIFICIAL REEFS ON FEW LOCATIONS WAS ALSO DONE. STUDY SHOWS THAT CONTINUOUS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCES BY MALAYSIA FOR MORE THAN 35 YEARS HAS RESULTED IN MAJOR MODIFICATIONS IN ARS TECHNOLOGY ESPECIALLY IN THE DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, INSTALLATION, PRE AND POST DEPLOYMENT MONITORING, AS WELL AS MATERIAL USED. IT WAS FOUND THAT, THE FOUR AGENCIES HAVE DIFFERENT IN THEIR POLICY OBJECTIVES AND GUIDELINES IN ARS MANAGEMENT CONCERNING THE MATERIAL USED, DEPLOYMENT AND ASSESSMENT. IT SEEMED THAT THE CONCEPT AND PURPOSE OF ESTABLISHING ARS FROM THE BEGINNING WAS ALSO NOT CLEARLY DEFINED BY THESE AGENCIES AND HAS CAUSE UNSUSTAINABLE WAY IN MANAGING THE ARS. INITIAL RESULTS ALSO INDICATED THAT USING THE LATEST DESIGN OF ARTIFICIAL REEFS HAS SHOWN SOME BETTER POTENTIAL IN THE TYPE OF FISH CATCHES AND IT CAN BE FURTHER DEVELOPED BY MANAGING THE ARS IN A SUSTAINABLE MANNER.	***

TYPICAL HYDROLOGICAL PARAMETERS MEASURED INCLUDE WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, CONDUCTIVITY, WATER TEMPERATURE AND DEPTH. WAVE INFORMATION IS OF INTEREST TO PORTS (R) USERS, BUT HAS ONLY BEEN OBTAINED RECENTLY IN A FEW PORTS (R) SITES. HOWEVER, CONTINUED STUDY AND LABORATORY AND FIELD TESTING OF VARIOUS WAVE MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENTS AND REAL TIME DATA TELEMETRY TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED SINCE 2003. THESE INSTRUMENTS AND TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDE TRIAXYS DIRECTIONAL WAVE BUOY, DIRECTIONAL WAVERIDER BUOY, AND ACOUSTIC DOPPLER CURRENT PROFILERS, UNDERWATER ACOUSTIC MODEM AND LINKS WITH RADIO AND SATELLITE. EXTRACTION OF NON DIRECTIONAL WAVE INFORMATION FROM NEAR SHORE TIDE GAUGES (E. G., AIR ACOUSTIC GAGE AND MICROWAVE RADAR ALTIMETER) HAS ALSO BEEN STUDIED. AMONG THESE, ACOUSTIC DOPPLER CURRENT PROFILERS (OR ADCP) ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST SINCE THEY ARE KEY INSTRUMENT IN PORTS (R) FOR CURRENT MEASUREMENTS. IT IS ECONOMICALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY ATTRACTIVE TO MEASURE BOTH CURRENTS AND WAVES. THIS PAPER SUMMARIZES THE NOS OPERATIONAL SYSTEM AND RESULTS OF TWO NOS FIELD STUDIES OF REAL TIME ADCP SYSTEMS FOR CURRENT AND WAVE MEASUREMENTS IN PORTS AND HARBORS. THE OPERATIONAL SYSTEM INCLUDES BOTTOM MOUNTED ADCP WITH BURIED CABLE IN THE NAVIGATION CHANNEL. LATER, THE SYSTEM WAS REPLACED BY A U. S. COAST GUARD AID TO NAVIGATION (ATON) BUOY MOUNTED ADCP WITH TELEMETRY RADIO. SHORE BASED HORIZONTAL ADCPS ARE ALSO BEING USED FOR REAL TIME CURRENT MEASUREMENT. THE TWO STUDIES (IN 2003 AND 2008) USED DIFFERENT ADCP INSTRUMENTS AND DATA TELEMETRY TECHNIQUES. THE ADCPS USED WERE RDI WORKHORSE SERIES AND AWAC (WITH INTERNAL PROCESSOR).

THESE EVENTS HAVE ALSO RAISED AWARENESS OF THE NEED FOR RISK ASSESSMENT FOR LOCAL (E.G. SUBMARINE AND SUBAERIAL LANDSLIDE GENERATED) AND NEAR FIELD TSUNAMIS (THOSE THAT CAN IMPACT A COASTAL COMMUNITY LESS THAN AN HOUR AFTER GENERATION). ALTHOUGH EXISTING TSUNAMI WARNING SYSTEMS SUCH AS DART (DEEP OCEAN ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING OF TSUNAMIS) ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT PROVIDING AN ASSESSMENT AND WARNING OF FAR FIELD TSUNAMI EVENTS, COMPARABLE SYSTEMS DO NOT CURRENTLY EXIST FOR LOCAL AND NEAR FIELD EVENTS. TSUNAMI INUNDATION MODELS CAN PREDICT COASTAL RUN UP YET THE LACK OF WAVE AMPLITUDE, DIRECTION, AND SHAPE DATA WITHIN A FEW MINUTES OF A NEAR FIELD TSUNAMI EVENT LIMITS THE INFORMATION NEEDED FOR WARNING POPULATIONS AT RISK. THE OCEAN NETWORKS CANADA (ONC) OBSERVATORY, COMBINING THE VENUS AND NEPTUNE CANADA CABLED NETWORKS, IS THE WORLDS LARGEST REGIONAL OCEAN OBSERVATION SYSTEM WITH OVER 900 KM OF ELECTRO OPTIC CABLE. THE ONC OBSERVATORY, LOCATED OFF THE EAST AND WEST COASTS OF VANCOUVER ISLAND SPANS THE JUAN DE FUCA TECTONIC PLATE AND EDGE OF THE OVERRIDING NORTH AMERICAN PLATE, A REGION KNOWN TO PRODUCE MEGA THRUST EARTHQUAKES. THE ONC OBSERVATORY HAS AN EXTENSIVE TSUNAMI MONITORING SYSTEM OF BOTTOM PRESSURE RECORDERS USED TO PROVIDE HIGH RESOLUTION TSUNAMI DATA FOR MODELING FAR FIELD TSUNAMIS IN COASTAL REGIONS [1]. SINCE THE START UP OF OPERATIONS OF THE NEPTUNE CANADA NETWORK IN 2009, THE CAPABILITY OF THE SYSTEM HAS ALREADY BEEN PROVEN BY THE HIGH PRECISION OF THE BOTTOM PRESSURE RECORDERS THAT MONITORED THE PASSAGE OF THE TSUNAMI WAVES GENERATED BY THE SAMOAN, CHILEAN, AND JAPANESE EARTHQUAKE EVENTS. THE OBSERVATORY HAS AN EXTENSIVE SENSOR NETWORK COVERING A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCH THEMES AND PROVIDES STANDARDIZED CONNECTION PORTS FOR GUEST INSTRUMENTS. THE SYSTEM IS SUPPORTED BY A SOPHISTICATED DATA MANAGEMENT AND ARCHIVING SYSTEM, WHICH PROVIDES DATA ACQUISITION, ARCHIVING, PROCESSING AND VISUALIZATION FROM SOURCES ACROSS THE OBSERVATORY. WITH THE BASE CORE TECHNOLOGIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR TSUNAMI WARNING SYSTEM RESEARCH, THE ONC OBSERVATORY IS AN IDEAL SITE FOR THE TEST AND EVALUATION OF NEAR FIELD TSUNAMI DETECTION TECHNOLOGIES. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES HOW THIS UNIQUE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE USED TO FACILITATE INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION, COMBINING NEW TECHNOLOGIES, CONCEPTS AND ALGORITHMS TO CREATE AN INTERNATIONAL NEAR FIELD TSUNAMI RESEARCH FACILITY TO DEVELOP, EVALUATE, AND TEST WARNING TECHNOLOGIES AND SOLUTIONS FOR AT RISK POPULATIONS.	***

UNDERLYING APPROXIMATELY 2200 KM(2) OF THE SWAN COASTAL PLAIN, THE GGS COMPRISES SEVERAL AQUIFER LEVELS WITH PARTIAL INTERCONNECTIVITY. SUPPLIES OF GGS GROUNDWATER ARE UNDER UNPRECEDENTED STRESS, DUE TO REDUCED RECHARGE AND INCREASES IN EXTRACTION. STORED RESERVES IN THE SUPERFICIAL AQUIFER FELL BY 700 GL BETWEEN 1979 AND 2008. OVER A SIMILAR PERIOD, ANNUAL EXTRACTION FOR PUBLIC SUPPLY INCREASED BY MORE THAN 350% FROM THE SYSTEM OVERALL. SOME MANAGEMENT AREAS ARE OVER ALLOCATED BY AS MUCH AS 69%. ONE POTENTIAL POLICY RESPONSE IS A TRADING SCHEME FOR GROUNDWATER USE. THERE HAS BEEN ONLY LIMITED TRADING BETWEEN GGS IRRIGATORS. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A ROBUST GROUNDWATER TRADING SCHEME FACES HYDROLOGICAL AND/OR HYDRO ECONOMIC CHALLENGES, AMONG OTHERS. GROUNDWATER TRADING INVOLVES TRANSFERS OF THE RIGHT TO EXTRACT WATER. THE RESULTING POTENTIAL FOR SPATIAL (AND TEMPORAL) REDISTRIBUTION OF THE IMPACTS OF EXTRACTION REQUIRES MANAGEMENT. IMPACTS AT THE RESPECTIVE SELLING AND BUYING LOCATIONS MAY DIFFER IN SCALE AND NATURE. NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES FROM GROUNDWATER TRADING MAY BE UNCERTAIN AS WELL AS NOT MONETARILY COMPENSABLE. AN IDEAL GROUNDWATER TRADING SCHEME WOULD ENSURE THAT MARGINAL COSTS FROM TRADES DO NOT EXCEED MARGINAL BENEFITS, INCORPORATING FUTURE EFFECTS AND IMPACTS ON THIRD PARTIES. IF THIS CONDITION COULD BE MET, ALL TRANSACTIONS WOULD RESULT IN CONSTANT OR IMPROVED OVERALL WELFARE. THIS PAPER EXAMINES ISSUES THAT COULD REDUCE PUBLIC WELFARE IF GROUNDWATER TRADING IS NOT SUBJECT TO WELL DESIGNED GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO MEETING THE ABOVE CONDITION. IT ALSO OUTLINES SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS KEY RISKS WITHIN THE DESIGN OF A GROUNDWATER TRADING SCHEME. WE PRESENT A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES, FOCUSING ON THOSE WITH HYDROLOGICAL BASES AND/OR INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS. THESE INCLUDE THE APPROPRIATE HYDROLOGICAL DEFINITION OF THE BOUNDARIES OF A TRADING AREA, THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DEFINING OF SUSTAINABLE YIELD AND CONSUMPTIVE POOL, AND THE ESTIMATION OF EFFECTS OF EXTRACTIONS ON ECOSYSTEMS AND HUMAN USERS. WE SUGGEST SEVERAL POSSIBLE DESIGN TOOLS. A COMBINATION OF SUSTAINABLE EXTRACTION LIMITS, TRADING RULES, MANAGEMENT AREAS, AND/OR EXCHANGE RATES MAY ENABLE A TRADING SCHEME TO ADDRESS THE ABOVE GOALS. (C) 2011 ELSEVIER B.V.

BEING AN URBANIZED COASTAL CITY, HONG KONG HAS ADOPTED A DUAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM SINCE THE 1950S FOR SEAWATER TOILET FLUSHING FOR 80% OF ITS 7 MILLION INHABITANTS. DESPITE ITS SUCCESS IN SAVING 750,000 M(3)/DAY OF FRESHWATER, THE SALINE SEWAGE (CONSISTING OF ABOUT 20 30% OF SEAWATER) APPEARS TO HAVE SACRIFICED THE URBAN WATER CYCLE IN TERMS OF WASTEWATER REUSE AND RECYCLING. CAN SEAWATER TOILET FLUSHING BE APPLIED WITHOUT AFFECTING THE URBAN WATER CYCLE WITH RESPECT TO SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT? TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, WE EXAMINED THE ENTIRE URBAN WATER CYCLE AND DEVELOPED AN INNOVATIVE WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM BY INTEGRATING FRESHWATER, SEAWATER AND RECLAIMED GREY WATER INTO A SUSTAINABLE, LOW FRESHWATER DEMAND, LOW ENERGY CONSUMPTION, AND LOW COST TRIPLE WATER SUPPLY (TWS) SYSTEM. THE APPLICABILITY OF THIS NOVEL SYSTEM HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED AT THE HONG KONG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT WHICH REDUCED 52% OF ITS FRESHWATER DEMAND.	***

THE USAGE OF POROUS PAVEMENTS FOR STORM WATER MANAGEMENT IN NORTHERN CLIMATES HAS MANY CHALLENGES, MOST OF WHICH RELATE TO THE EXTREME COLD AND SIGNIFICANT FROST PENETRATION INTO THE POROUS MEDIA. THE POROUS PAVEMENT SYSTEM WAS MONITORED FOR HYDRAULIC AND WATER QUALITY PERFORMANCE FROM 2004 TO 2008. THE USE OF POROUS PAVEMENTS FOR PARKING LOTS FOR NEW AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE ONE WATERSHED BASED STRATEGY THAT CAN BOTH MITIGATE IMPACTS FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND REVERSE IMPACTS IN AREAS WITH REDEVELOPMENT. SURFACE INFILTRATION CAPACITY AND FROST PENETRATION WERE MEASURED MONTHLY TO ASSESS WINTER PERFORMANCE. BECAUSE OF THE WELL DRAINED NATURE OF THE POROUS PAVEMENT AND RESERVOIR BASE, ISSUES RELATED TO FROZEN MEDIA WERE MINIMIZED. SIGNIFICANT FROST PENETRATION WAS OBSERVED UP TO DEPTHS OF 71 CM WITHOUT DECLINES IN HYDROLOGIC PERFORMANCE OR OBSERVABLE FROST HEAVE. NO CONSISTENT STATISTICAL DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED FOR SEASONAL HYDROLOGIC PERFORMANCE WITH MEAN INFILTRATION CAPACITY RANGING FROM 1,490 TO 2,690 CM/H. ADVERSE FREEZE THAW EFFECTS, SUCH AS HEAVING, WERE NOT OBSERVED, AND FOR THAT REASON, THE LIFE SPAN IS EXPECTED TO EXCEED THAT OF TYPICAL PAVEMENT APPLICATIONS IN NORTHERN CLIMATES. OBSERVED HYDROLOGIC RESPONSE RESEMBLED SHALLOW DEPTH GROUNDWATER DRAINAGE, AS IS THE GOAL FOR LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT DESIGNS. PEAK FLOWS WERE REDUCED BY 90% TO 0.58 M(3)/S/KM(2)+/ 0.74 IN COMPARISON WITH STANDARD IMPERVIOUS COVER5.5 M(3)/S/KM(2)+/ 7.7.

THE EFFECT OF THE USE OF COMPUTER SIMULATIONS IN THE COURSE SHOWS THAT THE STUDENTS WHO WERE TAUGHT WITH SIMULATION GAINED A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF LINEAR SCHEDULING CONCEPTS AND TECHNIQUES THAN THOSE STUDENTS TAUGHT WITHOUT SIMULATION. THE DATA AND ANALYSIS LEADING TO THIS FINDING ARE PRESENTED AND DISCUSSED IN THIS PAPER. TWO GROUPS OF STUDENTS WERE CONSIDERED IN THIS RESEARCH: (1) CIVIL ENGINEERING STUDENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL AND COASTAL ENGINEERING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA AND (2) CIVIL ENGINEERING STUDENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHILE. EACH GROUP WAS RANDOMLY SEPARATED INTO TWO SUBGROUPS: ONE SUBGROUP WAS TAUGHT BY USING THE TRADITIONAL METHOD OF LINEAR SCHEDULING (WITHOUT THE USE OF COMPUTER SIMULATION) AND THE OTHER SUBGROUP WAS TAUGHT BY USING SIMULATIONS. AT THE END OF THE TEACHING PERIOD, THE STUDENTS IN BOTH SUBGROUPS ANSWERED AN OBJECTIVE TEST TYPE QUESTIONNAIRE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF LINEAR SCHEDULING TECHNIQUES. THEY WERE ALSO REQUIRED, IN A MORE SUBJECTIVE WAY, TO PROVIDE THEIR EVALUATION OF THE TEACHING METHOD INVOLVED. TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF INCORPORATING COMPUTER SIMULATION IN TEACHING LINEAR SCHEDULING, THE STUDENTS EVALUATIONS AND ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE WERE STATISTICALLY COMPARED. THE ANALYSIS OF THE RESPONSES SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE STUDENTS UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBJECT BY USING THE TWO TEACHING METHODS, WITH THE USE OF COMPUTER SIMULATION SHOWN TO BE A MORE EFFECTIVE TEACHING TOOL FOR LINEAR SCHEDULING TECHNIQUES.

HOWEVER, OWING TO THE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL COMPLEXITY OF THE COASTAL FLUSHING PROCESS, EXISTING METHODS FOR DETERMINING FLUSHING TIME MAY NOT BE GENERALLY APPLICABLE. IN THIS PAPER, A SYSTEMATIC METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE FLUSHING TIME IN FCZS IS PRESENTED, IN WHICH BATHYMETRY, RUNOFF, TIDAL RANGE AND STRATIFICATION ARE PROPERLY ACCOUNTED FOR. WE DETERMINE THE FLUSHING TIME VIA NUMERICAL TRACER EXPERIMENTS, USING ROBUST 3D HYDRODYNAMIC AND MASS TRANSPORT MODELS. FOR FCZS LOCATED IN SHELTERED AND LAND LOCKED TIDAL INLETS, THE SYSTEM BOUNDARY CAN BE NATURALLY DEFINED AT THE CONNECTION WITH THE OPEN SEA. FOR FCZS LOCATED IN OPEN WATERS, HYDRODYNAMIC TRACKING IS FIRST USED TO ASSESS THE EXTENT OF TIDAL EXCURSION AND THUS DELIMIT THE INITIAL BOUNDARY BETWEEN CLEAN WATER AND POLLUTED WATER. THIS GENERAL METHOD IS APPLIED TO ALL DESIGNATED MARINE FCZS IN HONG KONG FOR BOTH THE DRY AND WET SEASONS, INCLUDING 20 SHELTERED FCZS (IN SEMI ENCLOSED WATERS OF TOLO HARBOUR, MIRS BAY, AND PORT SHELTER) AND 6 FCZS IN OPEN WATERS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT FLUSHING TIME IS THE LONGEST IN INNER PORT SHELTER (ABOUT 40 DAYS IN DRY SEASON), AND THE SHORTEST FOR THE FCZS IN OPEN WATERS (LESS THAN ONE WEEK IN DRY SEASON). IN ADDITION, THE FLUSHING TIME IN DRY SEASON IS COMMONLY LONGER THAN THAT IN WET SEASON: 20%SIMILAR TO 40% FOR MOST WELL SHELTERED FCZS; 2.6 SIMILAR TO 4 TIMES FOR THE OTHERS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE FLUSHING TIME AND DISTANCE TO OPEN BOUNDARY, SUPPORTING THE VIEW THAT THE FLUSHING TIME OF A FCZ IS CLOSELY RELATED TO ITS LOCATION. THIS STUDY PROVIDES A SOLID BASIS FOR MARICULTURE MANAGEMENT SUCH AS THE DETERMINATION OF CARRYING CAPACITY OF FCZS.	***

IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER POLLUTION REDUCTION STRATEGIES WERE EFFECTIVE, WE HAVE EVALUATED THE HISTORICAL TRENDS OF POLLUTION RECORDED IN SEDIMENTS OF THE BAY. A SEDIMENT CORE WAS DATED RADIOMETRICALLY USING NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FALLOUT RADIONUCLIDES. AN IRREGULARITY IN THE (210)PB RECORD WAS CAUSED BY AN EPISODE OF ACCELERATED SEDIMENTATION. THIS EPISODE WAS DATED TO OCCUR IN 1982, A YEAR COINCIDENT WITH THE HEAVIEST RAINS REPORTED IN HAVANA OVER THE XX CENTURY. PEAKS OF MASS ACCUMULATION RATES (MAR) WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HURRICANES AND INTENSIVE RAINS. IN THE PAST 60 YEARS, THESE MAXIMA ARE RELATED TO STRONG EL NINO PERIODS, WHICH ARE KNOWN TO INCREASE RAINFALL IN THE NORTH CARIBBEAN REGION. WE OBSERVED A STEADY INCREASE OF POLLUTION (MAINLY PB, ZN, SN, AND HG) SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY TO THE MID 90S, WITH ENRICHMENT FACTORS AS HIGH AS 6. MAR AND POLLUTION DECREASED RAPIDLY AFTER THE MID 90S, ALTHOUGH SOME TRACE METAL LEVELS REMAIN HIGH.

IN THIS ARTICLE, WE DISCUSS RECENT INDICATIONS OF TROPHIC CASCADES ON THE ATLANTIC AND BALTIC COASTS OF SWEDEN, WHERE INCREASED ABUNDANCES OF MESOPREDATORY FISH ARE LINKED TO INCREASED NEARSHORE PRODUCTION AND BIOMASS OF EPHEMERAL ALGAE. BASED ON SYNTHESIS OF MONITORING DATA, WE SUGGEST THAT OFFSHORE EXPLOITATION OF LARGER PREDATORY FISH HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN MESOPREDATOR FISH ALSO ALONG THE COASTS, WITH INDIRECT NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON IMPORTANT BENTHIC HABITATS AND COASTAL WATER QUALITY. THE RESULTS EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO REBUILD OFFSHORE AND COASTAL POPULATIONS OF LARGER PREDATORY FISH TO LEVELS WHERE THEY REGAIN THEIR CONTROL OVER LOWER TROPHIC LEVELS AND IMPORTANT LINKS BETWEEN OFFSHORE AND COASTAL SYSTEMS ARE RESTORED.	***

THE GOAL WAS TO REDUCE NITRATE AND TOTAL NITROGEN CONCENTRATIONS IN NUTRIENT SENSITIVE WATERSHEDS. TWO FIELD STUDIES IN THE PIEDMONT REGION OF NORTH CAROLINA, WHERE THE IN SITU SOILS TYPICALLY HAVE HIGH CLAY CONTENT, SHOWED THIS DESIGN FEATURE HAD POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE EXFILTRATION AND REDUCE DRAINAGE FROM BIORETENTION. TWO BIORETENTION CELLS IN ROCKY MOUNT, NORTH CAROLINA, WERE MONITORED FOR TWO YEAR LONG PERIODS TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF VARYING IWS ZONE DEPTHS OVER SANDIER UNDERLYING SOILS. NEARLY 99% OF RUNOFF ENTERING THE BIORETENTION CELL WITH SAND UNDERLYING SOIL (SAND CELL) WAS NEVER DIRECTLY DISCHARGED TO THE STORM WATER NETWORK. HOWEVER, THE HYDRAULIC RETENTION TIME (CONTACT TIME) OF RUNOFF IN THE MEDIA WAS LESS THAN 3 H, AND EXCEPT FOR TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLIDS (TSS), MINIMAL POLLUTANT REMOVAL WAS ACHIEVED. THE OTHER BIORETENTION CELL HAD A SANDY CLAY LOAM UNDERLYING SOIL (SCL CELL); THE PERCENTAGE OF RUNOFF LEAVING VIA EXFILTRATION AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION FROM THIS CELL WAS 87% DURING THE MONITORING PERIOD WITH A 1.03 M IWS ZONE DEPTH AND 75% WHEN THE IWS ZONE DEPTH WAS 0.73 M. THE UNDERLYING SOIL OF THE SCL CELL HAD A LOWER HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY, SO WATER WOULD REMAIN IN THE IWS ZONE FOR UP TO 7 DAYS. THE INCREASED HYDRAULIC RETENTION TIME IN THE MEDIA RESULTED IN LOWER OUTFLOW CONCENTRATIONS. FOR EVENTS MONITORED WITH DRAINAGE FROM THE SCL CELL, EFFICIENCY RATIOS OF ALL THE NITROGEN SPECIES AND TSS EXCEEDED 0.5. AS AN ADDITIONAL METRIC OF PERFORMANCE, THE PARKING LOT RUNOFF AND TREATED RUNOFF FROM BOTH THE SCL AND SAND CELLS WERE COMPARED TO CONCENTRATIONS CONSISTENT WITH GOOD AND FAIR BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATE HEALTH IN STREAMS. USING THIS METRIC, THE PARKING LOT RUNOFF ONLY MET THE FAIR STANDARD FOR TOTAL NITROGEN (TN) AND TOTAL PHOSPHORUS (TP), AND TREATED RUNOFF FROM THE SCL CELL ACHIEVED THE GOOD STANDARD FOR BOTH TN AND TP. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE SHORT HYDRAULIC RETENTION TIME OF RUNOFF IN THE MEDIA FOR THE SAND CELL, THIS CELL ONLY MAINTAINED THE FAIR STANDARD FOR TN AND DID NOT ACHIEVE THE FAIR STANDARD FOR TP.

NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT PLANS BASED ON SUCH RELATIONSHIPS, MOSTLY ESTABLISHED OVER TRENDS OF INCREASING RATHER THAN DECREASING NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS, ASSUME FULL REVERSIBILITY OF COASTAL EUTROPHICATION. MONITORING DATA FROM 28 ECOSYSTEMS LOCATED IN FOUR WELL STUDIED REGIONS WERE ANALYZED TO STUDY THE GENERALITY OF CHLOROPHYLL A VERSUS NUTRIENT RELATIONSHIPS AND THEIR APPLICABILITY FOR ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT. WE DEMONSTRATE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES ACROSS REGIONS AS WELL AS BETWEEN SPECIFIC COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS WITHIN REGIONS IN THE RESPONSE OF CHLOROPHYLL A TO CHANGING NITROGEN CONCENTRATIONS. WE ALSO SHOW THAT THE CHLOROPHYLL A VERSUS NITROGEN RELATIONSHIPS OVER TIME CONSTITUTE CONVOLUTED TRAJECTORIES RATHER THAN SIMPLE UNIQUE RELATIONSHIPS. THE RATIO OF CHLOROPHYLL A TO TOTAL NITROGEN ALMOST DOUBLED OVER THE LAST 30 40 YEARS ACROSS ALL REGIONS. THE UNIFORMITY OF THESE TRENDS, OR SHIFTING BASELINES, SUGGEST THEY MAY RESULT FROM LARGE SCALE CHANGES, POSSIBLY ASSOCIATED WITH GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE AND INCREASING HUMAN STRESS ON COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS. ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT MUST, THEREFORE, DEVELOP ADAPTATION STRATEGIES TO FACE SHIFTING BASELINES AND MAINTAIN ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AT A SUSTAINABLE LEVEL RATHER THAN STRIVING TO RESTORE AN ECOSYSTEM STATE OF THE PAST.	***

ALL ELECTRODE MATERIALS PERFORMED SIMILARLY IN TERMS OF SULFIDE REMOVAL, REMOVING 78 +/ 5%, 77 +/ 1%, 85 +/ 4%, 84 +/ 1%, AND 83 +/ 2% AT A CURRENT DENSITY OF 10 MA/CM(2) USING TA/IR, AU/IR, PT/IR, SNO(2) AND PBO(2), RESPECTIVELY. ELEVATED CHLORIDE CONCENTRATIONS, OFTEN OBSERVED IN COASTAL AREAS, DID NOT ENTAIL ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN PERFORMANCE. INDEPENDENT OF THE ELECTRODE MATERIAL USED, SULFIDE OXIDATION BY IN SITU GENERATED OXYGEN WAS THE PREDOMINANT REACTION MECHANISM. PASSIVATION OF THE ELECTRODE SURFACE BY DEPOSITION OF ELEMENTAL SULFUR DID NOT OCCUR. HOWEVER, SCALING WAS OBSERVED IN THE CATHODE COMPARTMENT. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT ALL THE MMO COATED TITANIUM ELECTRODE MATERIALS STUDIED ARE SUITABLE ANODIC MATERIALS FOR SULFIDE REMOVAL FROM WASTEWATER. TA/IR AND PT/IR COATED TITANIUM ELECTRODES SEEM THE MOST SUITABLE ELECTRODES SINCE THEY POSSESS THE LOWEST OVERPOTENTIAL FOR OXYGEN EVOLUTION, ARE STABLE AT LOW CHLORIDE CONCENTRATION AND ARE ALREADY USED IN FULL SCALE APPLICATIONS.

FECAL COLIFORM AND ENTEROCOCCI CONCENTRATIONS WERE MEASURED IN THE INFLOWING STORM WATER RUNOFF AND GROUNDWATER DOWNSLOPE OF THE SYSTEMS. BOTH GROUNDWATER BACTERIA CONCENTRATIONS NEAR THE SYSTEMS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE BACTERIA CONCENTRATIONS IN THE INFLOWING STORM WATER (P < 0.001). FURTHERMORE, GROUNDWATER FECAL COLIFORM CONCENTRATIONS AFTER IMPLEMENTING THE DISS WERE STATISTICALLY SIMILAR TO PRECONSTRUCTION LEVELS (P < 0.05). THE INITIAL RESULTS ARE PROMISING, AND THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR MORE WIDESPREAD USE. HOWEVER, FURTHER COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH IS RECOMMENDED TO MORE THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND THE VIABILITY OF THE DIS AS A STORM WATER BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE AND THE FATE AND TRANSPORT OF THE BACTERIA WITHIN THE DUNES.

THE USE OF NUMERICAL MODELS FOR AQUIFER SIMULATION WITHIN OPTIMIZATION MODELS IS CONSTRAINED BY THE HUGE COMPUTATIONAL BURDEN INVOLVED. APPROXIMATION SURROGATES ARE WIDELY USED TO REPLACE THE NUMERICAL SIMULATION MODEL, THE WIDELY USED SURROGATE MODEL BEING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS (ANN). THIS STUDY EVALUATES GENETIC PROGRAMMING (GP) AS A POTENTIAL SURROGATE MODELING TOOL AND COMPARES THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WITH THE NEURAL NETWORK BASED SURROGATE MODELING APPROACH. TWO LINKED SIMULATION OPTIMIZATION MODELS BASED ON ANN AND GP SURROGATE MODELS ARE DEVELOPED TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION RATES FOR AN ILLUSTRATIVE COASTAL AQUIFER. THE SURROGATE MODELS ARE LINKED TO A GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR OPTIMIZATION. THE OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS OBTAINED USING THE TWO APPROACHES ARE COMPARED AND THE ADVANTAGES OF GP OVER THE ANN SURROGATES EVALUATED.	***

THE FIRST STEP IN DEFINING THE ROLE OF ECOHYDROLOGY FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EU WATER FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE SHOULD BE THE ANALYSIS OF THE PATTERN OF SCIENTIFIC METHODOLOGIES THAT STIMULATE RECENT PROGRESS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES. SUCH PROGRESS HAS BEEN DIRECTLY TRANSLATED INTO GOOD ECOLOGICAL STATUS OF INLAND AND COASTAL WATERS. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE EVOLUTION OF PARADIGMS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES DURING RECENT DECADES, THREE STAGES CAN BE DISTINGUISHED. THE FIRST TWO ARE INFORMATION (STRUCTURE STATES, RELATIONSHIPS) AND KNOWLEDGE (THROUGH INTEGRATION OF DIFFERENT SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES, SYNERGIES IN INFORMATION CAN HIGHLIGHT THE PATTERNS AND PROCESSES (E.G. ECOHYDROLOGY)). THE THIRD AND MOST ADVANCED STAGE OF THE SCIENCE IS WISDOM THE ABILITY TO USE INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS WITH CONSIDERATION OF PRIORITIES TO SOCIETY. THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR TRANSITION FROM THE FIRST TO THE SECOND AND THIRD STAGES IS PROVIDED BY THREE PRINCIPLES OF ECOHYDROLOGY: HYDROLOGICAL (INFORMATION ON THE ABIOTIC STRUCTURE OF A RIVER BASIN; DYNAMICS OF HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SPATIAL TEMPORAL SPECIFICS OF ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS); ECOLOGICAL (THE POTENTIAL FOR BASIN RESILIENCE ENHANCEMENT); ECOTECHNOLOGICAL (THE USE OF INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ECOLOGICAL BIOTECHNOLOGIES AND SYSTEM SOLUTIONS). THE IMPLICIT CONCLUSION IS THAT IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE COST EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EU WATER FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE, MORE EFFORT HAS TO BE PUT INTO THE TRANSITION FROM RESEARCH TO INTERDISCIPLINARY EFFORTS TO DEEPEN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF PROCESSES AND REGULATORY MECHANISMS WITHIN ECOSYSTEMS. FURTHER PROGRESS FROM KNOWLEDGE TO WISDOM HAS TO BE MADE BY BROADER INVOLVEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTISTS WHO USE FORESIGHT METHODOLOGY FOR HARMONISATION TECHNOLOGIES, ENVIRONMENTAL POTENTIAL AND CULTURAL HERITAGE IN LARGE SCALE PROJECTS OF ENVIRONMENT RESTORATION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE.	***

A MAJOR DIFFICULTY IS THE LACK OF DETAIL IN THE DIRECTIVE REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MONITORING PROGRAMMES. THIS PAPER REVIEWS AND DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF MODELLING IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIRECTIVE, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON INTEGRATION OF MODELLING INTO DIRECTIVE MONITORING SYSTEMS. NEW APPROACHES, SUCH AS THE BAYESIAN MAXIMUM ENTROPY METHOD, ARE DISCUSSED. THE METHOD UTILISES MODELS IN THE PROCESSES OF WATERBODY MAPPING AND ASSESSMENT AND OPTIMISATION OF WATER QUALITY MONITORING PROGRAMMES; THE AUTHORS ARE CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING THE METHOD TO IRISH COASTAL WATERBODIES. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT ONE OF THE MAIN DIFFICULTIES IN IMPLEMENTING THE DIRECTIVE IS THE LACK OF A STRUCTURED APPROACH IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF MONITORING PROGRAMMES; MATHEMATICAL MODELS ARE RECOMMENDED TOOLS TO HELP OVERCOME THESE DIFFICULTIES.	***

THIS STUDY PROVIDES QUANTITATIVE INSIGHT INTO THE MORPHOLOGIC VARIABILITY OF MANAGED FOREDUNES OVER TIME SPANS OF DECADES. WE USED EMPIRICAL ORTHOGONAL FUNCTION (EOF) ANALYSIS ON A 45 YEAR DATA SET OF ANNUALLY SURVEYED DUNE PROFILES ALONG 97 KM OF THE NETHERLANDS COAST. ON AVERAGE, 70% OF THE DEVIATIONS FROM THE TIME AVERAGED PROFILES COULD BE RELATED TO CROSS SHORE COHERENT CHANGES IN FOREDUNE SHAPE AS MAPPED ONTO EOF 1.

TEN YEARS AGO, DESALINATION WAS CONFINED TO THE INDUSTRIAL USE ONLY ESPECIALLY IN OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY AS THE COUNTRY WAS RELYING ON RAIN WATER AND OTHER AVAILABLE SOURCES TO SUPPLY FRESH WATER TO MUNICIPALITIES. DUE TO CHRONIC DROUGHT CONDITIONS, THE MINISTRY OF WATER RESOURCES REVIEWED THE NATIONAL WATER STRATEGY AND A STRONG OPTION FOR DESALINATION WAS ADOPTED WHERE AN AMBITIOUS PROGRAM WAS THUS PUT INTO ACTION. SIXTEEN MEGA PLANTS, WITH CAPACITIES RANGING FROM 100,000 TO 500,000 M(3) PER DAY, PRIMARILY BASED ON REVERSE OSMOSIS TECHNOLOGY, WERE LAUNCHED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS MAKING THE ALGERIAN DESALINATION PROGRAM ONE OF THE WORLDS FASTEST GROWING MARKETS.

THEREFORE SALTWATER INTRUSION SHOULD BE PREVENTED OR AT LEAST CONTROLLED TO PROTECT GROUNDWATER RESOURCES. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A COST EFFECTIVE METHOD TO CONTROL SEAWATER INTRUSION IN COASTAL AQUIFERS. THIS METHODOLOGY ADR (ABSTRACTION, DESALINATION AND RECHARGE) INCLUDES; ABSTRACTION OF SALINE WATER AND RECHARGE TO THE AQUIFER AFTER DESALINATION. A COUPLED TRANSIENT DENSITY DEPENDENT FINITE ELEMENT MODEL IS DEVELOPED FOR SIMULATION OF FLUID FLOW AND SOLUTE TRANSPORT AND USED TO SIMULATE SEAWATER INTRUSION. THE SIMULATION MODEL HAS BEEN INTEGRATED WITH AN OPTIMIZATION MODEL TO EXAMINE THREE SCENARIOS TO CONTROL SEAWATER INTRUSION INCLUDING; ABSTRACTION, RECHARGE AND A COMBINATION SYSTEM, ADR. THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE MODELS ARE TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL DEPTHS, LOCATIONS AND ABSTRACTION/RECHARGE RATES FOR THE WELLS TO MINIMIZE THE TOTAL COSTS FOR CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION AS WELL AS SALT CONCENTRATIONS IN THE AQUIFER. A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE COMBINED SYSTEM (ADR) AND THE INDIVIDUAL ABSTRACTION OR RECHARGE SYSTEM IS MADE IN TERMS OF TOTAL COST AND TOTAL SALT CONCENTRATION IN THE AQUIFER AND THE AMOUNT OF REPULSION OF SEAWATER ACHIEVED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED ADR SYSTEM PERFORMS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN USING ABSTRACTION OR RECHARGE WELLS ALONE AS IT GIVES THE LEAST COST AND LEAST SALT CONCENTRATION IN THE AQUIFER. ADR IS CONSIDERED AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO CONTROL SEAWATER INTRUSION AND CAN BE APPLIED IN AREAS WHERE THERE IS A RISK OF SEAWATER INTRUSION.	***

MILK PRODUCTION LEVELS (KG/COW DAY) DIFFERED CONSIDERABLY WITH 2.57 FOR THE HIGHLAND AND 19.54 FOR THE COASTAL SYSTEM. A LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY WAS CALCULATED FOR THE FUNCTIONAL UNIT OF 1 KG ENERGY CORRECTED MILK (ECM) AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS GLOBAL WARMING, ACIDIFICATION AND EUTROPHICATION WERE ESTIMATED FOR 1 KG ECM, 1 HA AND 1 ANIMAL, CONSIDERING THE MULTI FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SYSTEM. THE HIGHLAND SYSTEM WAS CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH LAND USE (23.1 M(2)A/KG ECM VS. 1.71 M(2)A/KG ECM AT THE COAST). IRRIGATION WATER AND ENERGY WERE ON THE OTHER HAND USED TO A MUCH HIGHER AMOUNT AT THE COAST (7291 L/KG ECM AND 8791 MJ/KG ECM, RESPECTIVELY) THAN IN THE HIGHLANDS (848 L/KG ECM AND 0.20 MJ/KG ECM). GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL, ACIDIFICATION AND EUTROPHICATION WERE HIGHER FOR 1 KG ECM PRODUCED IN THE HIGHLANDS THAN AT THE COAST BY 10.6 KG CO(2) EQUIVALENTS, 6.58 G SULFUR DIOXIDE EQUIVALENTS AND 10.63 G PHOSPHATE EQUIVALENTS, RESPECTIVELY. NEVERTHELESS, 5220 KG CO(2) EQUIVALENTS MORE WERE EMITTED PER ANIMAL AT THE COAST THAN IN THE HIGHLANDS. ALSO ACIDIFICATION AND EUTROPHICATION WERE ESTIMATED TO BE ON AVERAGE 6 AND 4 TIMES HIGHER AT THE COAST COMPARED TO THE HIGHLANDS WHEN EXPRESSED FOR THE FUNCTIONAL UNITS OF 1 HA AND 1 ANIMAL. RESULTS: WHEREAS LIVESTOCK IS MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPACTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE HIGHLANDS, AT THE COAST BOTH LIVESTOCK RELATED EMISSIONS AND FORAGE CULTIVATION PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE. FURTHERMORE CO(2) RELEASES FROM SOYBEAN CULTIVATIONS HEAVILY CONTRIBUTE TO TOTAL EMISSIONS. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT FOR DAIRY SYSTEMS RELYING ON CROP BY PRODUCTS AS FEED THE CHOICE OF THE ALLOCATION METHOD IS A CRUCIAL POINT IN A LCA STUDY. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY, STRATEGIES IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN OF MILK PRODUCTION SHOULD FOCUS ON AN INCREASE OF PRODUCTION LEVELS AND A REDUCTION OF METHANE EMISSIONS FROM ENTERIC FERMENTATION IN THE HIGHLANDS AND A MODIFICATION OF THE CONCENTRATE COMPONENTS REPLACING SOYA AS THE PROTEIN SOURCE AT THE COAST.

HERE, GROUNDWATER IS DEFINED AS ALL SUBSURFACE WATER INCLUDING SOIL WATER, DEEPER VADOSE ZONE WATER, AND UNCONFINED AND CONFINED AQUIFER WATERS. POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE COMBINED WITH LAND AND WATER MANAGEMENT ON SURFACE WATERS HAVE BEEN STUDIED IN SOME DETAIL. EQUIVALENT STUDIES OF GROUNDWATER SYSTEMS HAVE LAGGED BEHIND THESE ADVANCES, BUT RESEARCH AND BROADER INTEREST IN PROJECTED CLIMATE EFFECTS ON GROUNDWATER HAVE BEEN ACCELERATING IN RECENT YEARS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW AND SYNTHESIS OF THE KEY ASPECTS OF SUBSURFACE HYDROLOGY, INCLUDING WATER QUANTITY AND QUALITY, RELATED TO GLOBAL CHANGE. ADAPTATION TO GLOBAL CHANGE MUST INCLUDE PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF GROUNDWATER AS A RENEWABLE, BUT SLOW FEEDBACK RESOURCE IN MOST CASES. GROUNDWATER STORAGE IS ALREADY OVER TAPPED IN MANY REGIONS, YET AVAILABLE SUBSURFACE STORAGE MAY BE A KEY TO MEETING THE COMBINED DEMANDS OF AGRICULTURE, INDUSTRY, MUNICIPAL AND DOMESTIC WATER SUPPLY, AND ECOSYSTEMS DURING TIMES OF SHORTAGE. THE FUTURE INTENSITY AND FREQUENCY OF DRY PERIODS COMBINED WITH WARMING TRENDS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE CONTEXT OF GROUNDWATER RESOURCES, EVEN THOUGH PROJECTIONS IN SPACE AND TIME ARE FRAUGHT WITH UNCERTAINTY.

SOME FORM OF BIOLOGICALLY BASED, HABITAT SPECIFIC REFERENCE STANDARD SEEMS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR WISE MANAGEMENT AND STEWARDSHIP OF MARSH ECOSYSTEMS. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A STATISTICAL METHOD TO DEFINE AND TO CHARACTERIZE A WATER BODY TYPOLOGY FOR DRAINED MARSHES OF THE CHARENTE MARITIME WETLANDS ON THE FRENCH ATLANTIC COAST, PLACING PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AS HYDRAULIC FUNCTIONING, HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND PEDOLOGICAL SUBSTRATUM. THE CHARENTE MARITIME MARSHES REPRESENT A GOOD FIELD STUDY BECAUSE OF HIS HIGH DIVERSITY OF TYPES OF MARSHES AND OF ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES IN A RESTRICTIVE AREA THUS ERASING SPATIAL CLIMATIC EFFECT (LATITUDE EFFECT). THE STATISTICAL METHOD DEVELOPED HERE HAD PERMITTED TO DEFINE AND CHARACTERIZE 12 DIFFERENT WATER BODIES, 7 IN FRESHWATER (F1 TO F7) AND 5 IN SALT WATER MARSHES FOR THE CHARENTE MARITIME AREA. THIS TYPOLOGY DEMONSTRATED AN IMPORTANT LINK BETWEEN THE SIZE CATCHMENT AREA, NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS, AND LEACHING OF PRECIPITATION FROM CULTURED SOILS. EVEN THOUGH THE CHARENTE MARITIME MARSHES ARE STRONGLY IMPACTED BY HUMANS, THEY MAY STILL RETAIN THE ABILITY TO REMOVE NITRATE. THE INCREASING GRADIENT OF WATER RENEWAL IN THE FRESHWATER MARSHES FROM F1 TO F7 EXPLAINED THE DECREASING GRADIENT OF EUTROPHICATION. A BETTER MANAGEMENT OF THE HYDRODYNAMIC OF THE MARSHES CAN AVOID EUTROPHICATION RISK ON THE COASTAL SEA AREA.

WE INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF SUCH A HUGE TOPOGRAPHIC INTERVENTION ON TIDAL DYNAMICS, WHICH IS A KEY ASPECT IN HYDRODYNAMICS, AND INDIRECTLY ALSO AFFECTING MORPHODYNAMICS AND ECOLOGY. BECAUSE OF THE UNPRECEDENTED EXTENT OF THE EXTRACTION SCENARIO, WE FOLLOW A GENERIC APPROACH AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSICAL MECHANISMS BEHIND THE CHANGES, THE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE AND AREA OF INFLUENCE. HENCE, RATHER THAN APPLYING AN EXISTING NUMERICAL MODEL, WE DEVELOP AN IDEALIZED MODEL FOR TIDE PROPAGATION IN SEMI ENCLOSED RECTANGULAR BASINS. THE MODEL GEOMETRY CONSISTS OF THREE ADJACENT COMPARTMENTS WITH A REALISTIC CROSS BASIN DEPTH PROFILE, THE TRENCH BEING LOCATED IN THE SECOND COMPARTMENT, WHILE ASSUMING ALONG BASIN UNIFORMITY OF DEPTH WITHIN EACH COMPARTMENT. THE PROBLEM IS FORCED BY AN INCOMING KELVIN WAVE. THE SOLUTION IN EACH COMPARTMENT, SATISFYING THE LINEAR DEPTH AVERAGED SHALLOW WATER EQUATIONS ON THE F PLANE INCLUDING BOTTOM FRICTION, IS WRITTEN AS THE SUPERPOSITION OF SEMI NUMERICALLY OBTAINED WAVE SOLUTIONS. A COLLOCATION TECHNIQUE IS EMPLOYED TO SATISFY NO NORMAL FLOW ACROSS THE BASINS CLOSED END AS WELL AS CONTINUITY OF ELEVATION AND FLUX ACROSS THE INTERFACES BETWEEN THE COMPARTMENTS. THE RESULTS INDICATE CHANGES IN TIDAL RANGE, PHASE AND CURRENTS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BASIN, WHICH SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF A MODEL DOMAIN ON THE SCALE OF THE BASIN. CHANGES IN COASTAL TIDAL RANGE SHOW ZONES OF DECREASE AND INCREASE (ORDER CM). CHANGES IN COASTAL SHORE PARALLEL TIDAL CURRENT AMPLITUDES ARE OF THE ORDER OF CM S( 1). A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS FOR VARIOUS TRENCH GEOMETRIES SHOWS THAT THE HYDRODYNAMIC IMPACT GENERALLY INCREASES WITH INCREASING EXTRACTION VOLUME, BEING MORE SENSITIVE TO TRENCH DEPTH AND WIDTH THAN TRENCH LENGTH. THE CHANGES IN TIDAL CURRENTS MAY STRUCTURALLY ALTER SEDIMENT TRANSPORT RATES WITH SEVERAL PERCENTS. AS THE BATHYMETRY AND COASTAL MORPHOLOGY RESULT FROM SUBTLE BALANCES IN LONG TERM SEDIMENT TRANSPORT, THE TRENCH MAY INDIRECTLY AFFECT VARIOUS USER FUNCTIONS AND VALUES (COASTAL SAFETY, NAVIGATION, MARINE ECOLOGY, CABLES AND PIPELINES) AND, HENCE, BE OF CONCERN TO COASTAL MANAGEMENT.

THIS DATA SET HAS BEEN PROCESSED TO CREATE SEPARATE TIME SERIES OF BEACH VOLUMES AT LONGSHORE INTERVALS OF ABOUT 250 M, GIVING OVER 2000 TIME SERIES IN TOTAL. THESE TIME SERIES TYPICALLY SHOW A HIGH ANNUAL VARIABILITY WITH WEAK LONG TERM TRENDS. THE PRESENT DUTCH NATIONAL COASTAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY INVOLVES MAKING YEAR AHEAD FORECASTS OF BEACH VOLUMES BY EXTRAPOLATING A LINEAR LEAST SQUARES TREND THROUGH THE PREVIOUS TEN YEARS DATA SEPARATELY FOR EACH LONGSHORE LOCATION. IN THIS PAPER, THESE FORECASTS ARE SHOWN TO BE WORSE THAN THE TRIVIAL FORECAST IN WHICH THE MOST RECENTLY MEASURED BEACH VOLUME PERSISTS UNCHANGED INTO THE FUTURE, WITH A MEAN SQUARE ERROR (MSE) ABOUT 13.5% WORSE (EQUIVALENT TO A ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR (RMSE) 6.5% WORSE). IMPROVEMENTS TO THESE FORECASTS ARE SOUGHT BY TESTING SIX DIFFERENT UNIVARIATE FORECASTING METHODS. THE TWO BEST METHODS IMPROVE ON THE PERSISTENCE OF THE MOST RECENTLY MEASURED BEACH VOLUME BY ABOUT 15% MSE (8% RMSE), AND ON THE PRESENTLY USED LINEAR LEAST SQUARES TREND METHOD BY ABOUT 25% MSE (13.5% RMSE). FURTHER COMPARISONS ARE MADE BETWEEN THE FORECASTING METHODS TO INVESTIGATE SEVERAL FACTORS. THESE INCLUDE VARYING THE AMOUNT OF FITTING DATA FOR THE FORECASTING METHODS, SMOOTHING OF THE FITTING DATA, DIFFERENT METHODS FOR INTERPOLATING GAPS IN THE DATA, THE LONGSHORE AGGREGATION OF DATA, MAKING FORECASTS FOR COASTAL PROFILES WITH AND WITHOUT NOURISHMENTS, AND MAKING FORECASTS UP TO FIVE YEARS AHEAD. THESE FORECASTING METHODS ARE DESIGNED AS A COASTAL MANAGEMENT TOOL TO PROVIDE YEARLY FORECASTS QUICKLY AND ROUTINELY FOR THE WHOLE DUTCH NORTH SEA COAST. (C) 2011 ELSEVIER B.V.

A HIGHER RECOVERY RATE IS AN IMPORTANT GOAL BECAUSE IT INCREASES PRODUCTION AND IMPROVES COST EFFECTIVENESS. AS THE RECOVERY RATIO INCREASES, HOWEVER, THE CONCENTRATION OF DISSOLVED IONS IN THE BRINE BECOMES HIGH ENOUGH TO FORM SCALING CAUSED BY PRECIPITATION OF SUPER SATURATED SALTS. THESE PRECIPITATES MIGHT FORM A SCALE NOT ONLY ON MEMBRANES SURFACES BUT ALSO IN THE BRINE DISPOSAL LINE. IN ORDER TO PREVENT SCALE FORMATION, SPECIAL ANTISCALANTS ARE ADDED TO THE REVERSE OSMOSIS FEED. IT IS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT ANTISCALANTS ONLY DELAY THE ONSET OF PRECIPITATION, RESULTING IN POSSIBLE SCALE PRECIPITATION IN LONG OUTLET PIPES. IN ADDITION TO THE TENDENCY OF SCALING, BRINE DISPOSAL CAN BE A SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN THAT NEEDS TO BE STUDIED AND CONSIDERED WHEN BUILDING A DESALINATION PLANT. MARINE BRINE DISPOSAL CAN CAUSE THREE POSSIBLE HAZARDS: PRECIPITATION ON THE PIPE WALLS, SOIL AND MARINE CONTAMINATION. SINCE 2004, MEKOROT HAS EXCLUSIVELY OPERATED AND MAINTAINED A UNIQUE 30 KM LONG BRINE DISPOSAL PIPELINE TO THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA WITH THE REQUIRED PERMISSION FROM THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. THE PIPE IS USED TO DISPOSE BRINE STREAMS FROM THE GAT AND GRANOT BWRO DESALINATION PLANTS, WHICH ARE LOCATED IN SOUTHWESTERN ISRAEL NEAR THE CITY OF ASHKELON. A BRINE DISPOSAL PIPE WAS DEVELOPED BY MEKOROT AS PART OF A COASTAL AQUIFER REHABILITATION PROJECT AND WAS CHOSEN AS THE MOST ECONOMIC SOLUTION FOR THESE TWO PLANTS. A FEW YEARS AGO, AN EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM WAS RUN TO OBTAIN THE DESIGN PARAMETERS FOR PREVENTING SCALE DEPOSITION FROM A CONCENTRATE SOLUTION. THROUGH THE DESIGN OF OPTIMAL OPERATION OF BRINE PIPES, WE PREVENT SOIL CONTAMINATION AND AVOID SCALE DEPOSITION FROM CONCENTRATE SOLUTIONS FROM BOTH DESALINATION PLANTS. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF THE BRINE DISPOSAL PIPE, INCLUDING EARLY SCALE DETECTION, AS WELL AS THE STANDARD AND SPECIAL MONITORING PROGRAMS FOR THE LONG BRINE DISPOSAL PIPE AT MEKOROT.	***

IN THIS PAPER, THE EFFECTIVE VARIABLES HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED AND PRIORITIZED USING MULTI CRITERIA ANALYSIS WITH ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS (ANN) AND EXPERT OPINION AND JUDGMENT. THE SELECTED VARIABLES WERE CLASSIFIED AND ORGANIZED USING THE MULTIVARIATE TECHNIQUES OF CLUSTER ANALYSIS, FACTOR ANALYSIS, PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS AND CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE RESULTS OF ANN ANALYSIS AND EXPERT OPINION AND JUDGMENT IN TERMS OF RANKING AND PRIORITIZING THE SOCIO ECONOMIC VARIABLES.

THIS ENSURES THE SUCCESS OF UNDERTAKING RESPONSIVE TECHNICAL, MANAGERIAL AND REGULATORY MEASURES. INCOME PER CAPITA HAS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY. EFFICIENCY OF REVENUE COLLECTION IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT SOCIO ECONOMIC FACTOR. THE MODELS STRENGTHEN THE INTEGRATION OF PREVENTIVE APPROACH INTO GROUNDWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.

THE ECOSYSTEM IS POISED UNDER RISKS OF: ECOLOGICAL FAILURE DUE TO INCREASED FRAGMENTATION BY URBANIZATION; GROUNDWATER FLOW DISRUPTION BECAUSE OF SINKHOLE FORMATION; AND INTRUSION OF OCEANIC WATER WITH DECREASING WATER TABLE HEAD BECAUSE OF DROUGHT OR OVER PUMPING. IT WAS FOUND IMPORTANT TO SYNTHESIZE THE SPATIOTEMPORAL STATE OF THE GROUNDWATER HYDROLOGY AND ALSO DEVELOP A FORECASTING MODEL TO SUPPORT THE INTENSIVE MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING IN PLACE. IN THIS STUDY, AN OBJECTIVE WAS SET TO DEVELOP A STOCHASTIC SEQUENCE MODEL CAPABLE OF FORECASTING GROUNDWATER LEVELS ON A MONTHLY SPAN AT A DAILY TIME SCALE. THE GROUNDWATER LEVEL SIMULATION WAS CONCEPTUALIZED AS A SEQUENCE OF DAILY FLUCTUATING STATES OF MAGNITUDES AND PATTERNS THAT HAS A DEFINED PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE. THE MODEL SETUP INVOLVED REPRESENTATION OF DAILY FLUCTUATION MAGNITUDES IN TEN STATES AND PATTERN CHANGES IN THREE STATES. THE SEQUENTIAL OCCURRENCE OF STATES OF MAGNITUDES AND PATTERNS AT EACH TIME STEP WAS USED FOR ESTIMATION OF THE TRANSITIONAL PROBABILITIES AND EMPLOYED IN A HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL FRAME WORK FOR ENSEMBLE GENERATION AND ESTIMATION OF POSTERIOR PROBABILITIES. A REALIZATION WAS CHOSEN BASED ON THE HIGHEST MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD RATIO OF 90% AND SMALLEST ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR OF 0.05 0.12 M AGAINST THE HISTORICAL DATA. A MONTHLY FORECASTING AT DAILY TIME STEP WAS DONE DYNAMICALLY INCORPORATING OBSERVED DATA AT EACH TIME STEP AND REVISING PRIOR AND POSTERIOR PROBABILITY ESTIMATION IN THE HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL FORMULATION. A CASE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT THREE WELL SITES, WHICH ARE SITUATED AT THREE DIFFERENT HYDROGEOLOGIC SETTINGS. THE MODEL NOT ONLY REPRODUCED ANNUAL GROUNDWATER FLUCTUATION PATTERNS BUT ALSO FORECASTED PRECEDING MONTHLY FLUCTUATIONS AT MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD RATIO ABOVE 90% AND ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR BELOW 0.15 M. A FURTHER STUDY WAS RECOMMENDED FIRST TO ANALYZE BREAK POINT PARAMETRIC ESTIMATION FOR SEASONAL ANALYSIS, AND SECONDLY TO INTEGRATE THE APPROACH IN OTHER HYDROLOGICAL MODELS FOR THE PURPOSE OF SYNTHETIC GROUNDWATER FLUCTUATION GENERATION.	***

RECENT DATA, HOWEVER, SUGGEST THIS PERSISTENCE IS UNDER THREAT AS DATA INDICATE SOME SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN ASPECTS OF THEIR ABUNDANCE SINCE 1999. THE INFLUENCE OF CHANGES IN LAKE LEVEL, ALLODIVERSITY AND FISHING EFFORT ON THIS DECLINE WAS TESTED AND SHOWED THAT A DECLINE IN LAKE LEVEL WAS A SIGNIFICANT CAUSAL FACTOR. THE RECENT CHANGE IN ALLODIVERSITY, WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DOMINANCE OF CYPRINUS CARPIO IN THE FISHERY, WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT ON THE CATCH PER UNIT EFFORT OF O. LEUCOSTICTUS BUT WAS ON T. ZILLII. SINCE 1999, CATCHES OF TILAPIINES IN THE FISHERY HAVE BEEN INDEPENDENT OF FISHING EFFORT, CONTRARY TO BETWEEN 1975 AND 1987, SUGGESTING THEIR MANAGEMENT THROUGH APPLICATION OF FISHERY MODELS MAY NO LONGER BE APPLICABLE. AS IT WAS ANTHROPOGENIC MEDIATED LAKE LEVEL CHANGES THAT WERE MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR DECLINE, THEN LAKE MANAGEMENT SHOULD FOCUS ON SUSTAINABLE WATER UTILIZATION THAT MAXIMIZES LAKE LEVELS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BASIN WIDE WATER BALANCE.	***

THE NEW MODEL DEPARTS FROM TRADITIONAL APPROACHES THAT USE THE SLOPE OF THE BEACH FACE BETA(F) AND THE IRIBARREN NUMBER XI(0) AS PARAMETERS FOR PREDICTING RUN UP AND INSTEAD USES THE DISTANCE OFFSHORE X(H) TO WATER DEPTH H TO ESTIMATE A NEAR SHORE PROFILE SLOPE AS S H/X(H), WHERE THE DEPTH OF CLOSURE IS THE PROPOSED CHOICE FOR H. EXTREME RUN UP R X IS THEN EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF S AS R X/HO CS2/3. OBSERVATIONS FROM RECENT SEVERE STORM EVENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA ARE USED TO ESTIMATE THE DIMENSIONLESS COEFFICIENT C SIMILAR OR EQUAL TO 7.5. THE DATA ARE ALSO COMPARED WITH THOSE OF HOLMAN [1986] AND THE RESULTS VERIFY HIS REGRESSION EQUATIONS AND CONFIRM THEY ARE VALID FOR SIGNIFICANT WAVE HEIGHTS EXTENDING TO 8.5 M FOR BEACH FACE SLOPES AROUND 0.1 . THE RUN UP PREDICTIONS OF HOLMAN [1986], NIELSEN AND HANSLOW [1991] AND STOCKDON ET AL. [2006] ARE COMPARED TO THOSE OF THE PROPOSED NEW MODEL. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE NEW MODEL REDUCES THE UNCERTAINTIES IN PREDICTING WAVE RUN UP ON NATURAL BEACHES COMPARED WITH PREVIOUS MODELS, AND THUS ENABLES IMPROVED ESTIMATES OF EXTREME WAVE RUN UP AND THE UPPER LIMIT OF BEACH CHANGE FOR COASTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT.	***

ACROSS CALIFORNIA, THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOSSES BY 2100 AND PREDICTIVE INUNDATION MODELS WILL BE RELIED UPON AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO PLAN ADAPTATION STRATEGIES AND FORECAST LOCALIZED FLOOD IMPACTS TO SUPPORT EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. HOWEVER, THE PREDICTIVE SKILL OF URBAN INUNDATION MODELS FOR EXTREME TIDE EVENTS HAS NOT BEEN CRITICALLY EXAMINED PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO DATA QUALITY AND FLOOD MAPPING METHODOLOGIES. WITH A CASE STUDY OF NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA, WE SHOW THAT TIDAL FLOODING CAN BE RESOLVED ALONG STREETS AND AT INDIVIDUAL PARCELS USING A 2D HYDRAULIC INUNDATION MODEL THAT CAPTURES EMBAYMENT AMPLIFICATION OF THE TIDE, OVERTOPPING OF FLOOD DEFENSES, AND OVERLAND FLOW ALONG STREETS AND INTO PARCELS.

PUBLISHED APPROACHES TO THE OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT OF GROUNDWATER ABSTRACTION FROM REGULATED COASTAL AQUIFERS COMPRISE ELEMENTS OF TRIGGER LEVEL MANAGEMENT AND FLUX BASED MANAGEMENT. TRIGGER LEVEL MANAGEMENT RELIES ON MEASURED GROUNDWATER LEVELS, GROUNDWATER SALINITIES AND/OR ECOSYSTEM HEALTH INDICATORS, WHICH ARE COMPARED TO OBJECTIVE VALUES (TRIGGER LEVELS), THEREBY INVOKING MANAGEMENT RESPONSES (E.G. PUMPING CUT BACKS). FLUX BASED MANAGEMENT APPORTIONS GROUNDWATER ABSTRACTION RATES BASED ON ESTIMATES OF AQUIFER RECHARGE AND DISCHARGE (INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL WATER REQUIREMENTS). THIS PAPER OFFERS A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF COASTAL AQUIFER MANAGEMENT PARADIGMS USING PUBLISHED COASTAL AQUIFER CASE STUDIES COMBINED WITH A SIMPLE EVALUATION OF THE ULEY SOUTH COASTAL AQUIFER, SOUTH AUSTRALIA. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT TRIGGER LEVEL MANAGEMENT OFFERS ADVANTAGES OVER FLUX BASED APPROACHES THROUGH THE EVALUATION OF REAL TIME RESOURCE CONDITIONS AND TRENDS, ALLOWING FOR MANAGEMENT RESPONSES AIMED AT PROTECTING AGAINST WATER QUALITY DETERIORATION AND EXCESSIVE STORAGE DEPLETION. HOWEVER, FLUX BASED APPROACHES ARE CRITICAL FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND ARE REQUIRED TO PREDICT AQUIFER RESPONSES TO CLIMATIC AND PUMPING STRESSES. A SIMPLIFIED MODELLING ANALYSIS OF THE ULEY SOUTH BASIN RESPONSES TO DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES DEMONSTRATES THE ADVANTAGES OF CONSIDERING A HYBRID MANAGEMENT APPROACH THAT INCLUDES BOTH TRIGGER LEVEL AND FLUX BASED CONTROLS. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT WHERE POSSIBLE, TRIGGER LEVEL AND FLUX BASED APPROACHES BE ADOPTED CONJUNCTIVELY TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF COASTAL GROUNDWATER DEGRADATION AND TO UNDERPIN STRATEGIES FOR FUTURE AQUIFER MANAGEMENT AND WELL FIELD OPERATION.	***

IN THIS STUDY, WE USE 5 MONTHS OF CONTINUOUS RADON ((222)RN, A NATURAL GROUNDWATER TRACER) OBSERVATIONS TO LINK ESTUARINE ACIDIFICATION TO GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE IN AN AUSTRALIAN CASS CATCHMENT (TUCKEAN SWAMP). THE RADON TIME SERIES BEGAN IN THE DRY SEASON, WHEN RADON ACTIVITIES WERE LOW (2 3 DPM L( 1)), AND THE PH OF SURFACE WATER WAS 6.4. WE CAPTURED A MAJOR RAIN EVENT (213 MM ON 2 MARCH 2010) THAT FLOODED THE CATCHMENT. AN IMMEDIATE DROP IN PH. DURING THE FLOOD MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO SURFACE WATER INTERACTIONS WITH SOIL PRODUCTS. DURING THE POST FLOOD STAGE, INCREASED RADON ACTIVITIES (UP TO 19.3 DPM L( 1)) AND FLOODPLAIN GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE RATES (UP TO 2.01 M(3) S( 1), EQUIVALENT TO 19% OF TOTAL RUNOFF) COINCIDED WITH LOW PH (3.77). ANOTHER SPIKE IN RADON ACTIVITIES (13.2 DPM L( 1)) COINCIDED WITH THE LOWEST RECORDED SURFACE WATER PH (3.62) AFTER 72 MM OF RAIN BETWEEN 17 AND 20 APRIL 2010. ABOUT 80% OF CATCHMENT ACID EXPORTS OCCURRED WHEN THE ESTUARY WAS DOMINATED BY GROUNDWATER DISCHARGING FROM HIGHLY PERMEABLE CASS DURING THE FLOOD RECESSION.	***

THE GEOLOGIC HETEROGENEITIES CONTROLLING THE WATER FLOW ARE OFTEN INSUFFICIENTLY MAPPED. AS KARST AQUIFERS ARE VERY VULNERABLE TO POLLUTION, GROUNDWATER PROTECTION AND LAND USE MANAGEMENT ARE CRUCIAL TO PRESERVE WATER RESOURCES AND MAINTAIN ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. MULTIPLE MODEL SIMULATION HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPACT OF MODEL STRUCTURE UNCERTAINTY ON MANAGEMENT DECISIONS USING SEVERAL PLAUSIBLE CONCEPTUAL MODELS. MULTIPLE MODEL SIMULATION WAS USED FOR THIS PURPOSE ON THE YUCATAN PENINSULA, WHICH IS ONE OF THE WORLDS LARGEST KARSTIC AQUIFERS. THE AQUIFER IS THE ONLY AVAILABLE FRESH WATER SOURCE FOR HUMAN USERS AND ECOSYSTEMS ON THE PENINSULA. ONE OF MEXICOS LARGEST PROTECTED AREAS, THE GROUNDWATER DEPENDENT SIAN KAAN BIOSPHERE RESERVE (5280 KM(2)) IS FED BY THE AQUIFERS THIN FRESHWATER LENS. INCREASING GROUNDWATER ABSTRACTIONS AND POLLUTION THREATENS THE FRESH WATER RESOURCE, AND CONSEQUENTLY THE ECOSYSTEM INTEGRITY OF BOTH SIAN KAAN AND THE ADJACENT COASTAL ENVIRONMENT. SEVEN DIFFERENT CATCHMENT SCALE CONCEPTUAL MODELS WERE IMPLEMENTED IN A DISTRIBUTED HYDROLOGICAL MODELLING APPROACH. EQUIVALENT POROUS MEDIUM CONCEPTUALIZATIONS WITH UNIFORM AND HETEROGENEOUS DISTRIBUTIONS OF HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITIES WERE USED. THE MODELS DEMONSTRATED THAT SIAN KAANS WETLANDS ARE INDEED GROUNDWATER FED. THE WATER QUANTITIES IN THE WETLANDS AND THE FLOODING DYNAMICS ARE DETERMINED BY THE LARGER GROUNDWATER CATCHMENT. THE OVERALL WATER BALANCE FOR THE MODEL DOMAIN SHOWED THAT RECHARGE CONSTITUTES 4400 +/ 700 MILLION M(3)/YEAR. OF THIS, 4 12% EXITS AS OVERLAND FLOW, AND 88 96% EXITS AS GROUNDWATER FLOW. NET GROUNDWATER OUTFLOW FROM THE MODEL DOMAIN TO THE NORTH VIA THE HOLBOX FRACTURE ZONE APPEARS AS AN IMPORTANT CROSS BASIN TRANSFER BETWEEN REGIONS OF THE PENINSULA. PROBABILITY MAPS OF SIAN KAANS CATCHMENT WERE OBTAINED THROUGH AUTOMATIC CALIBRATION AND STOCHASTIC MODELLING. GROUNDWATER TRAVEL TIME ZONES WERE CALCULATED BASED ON DIFFERENT CALIBRATED EFFECTIVE POROSITIES. THE SPATIAL MODELLING RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPACT OF REGIONAL SCALE STRUCTURES ON THE FLOW FIELD AND TRANSPORT TIMES. (C) 2011 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

THIS PAPER PRESENTS A NEW PHYSICAL METHOD OF ESTIMATING HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY BASED ON THE WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATION MODEL DEVELOPED BY PARK AND PARKER (PARK, E., PARKER, J.C., 2008. A SIMPLE MODEL FOR WATER TABLE FLUCTUATIONS IN RESPONSE TO PRECIPITATION. J. HYDROL. 356, 344 349). THE DEVELOPED PROCEDURE WAS VALIDATED BY COMPARISON WITH THE HYPOTHETICAL NUMERICAL MODEL FOR A VARIETY OF HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITIES, AQUIFER INCLINATIONS, AND THE HETEROGENEITIES. THE MODEL WAS FOUND TO BE HIGHLY RELIABLE WHEN USING WATER LEVEL DATA FAR FROM THE HYDRAULIC BOUNDARIES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE MONITORING DATA OBTAINED OVER A RANGE OF RELATIVE DISTANCES OF AN OBSERVATION LOCATION (X) TO THE FLOW DOMAIN (W), X/W > 0.2 AVOIDED THE BOUNDARY EFFECTS. A CORRECTION FACTOR WAS ALSO PROPOSED BASED ON THE DEVIATION ANALYSIS OF THE CALIBRATED K AND F/N (RATIO OF RECHARGE TO PRECIPITATION DIVIDED BY POROSITY). THE RESULTS FROM THE BASAL INCLINATIONS AND THE HETEROGENEITIES CASES SUGGEST THAT THE ESTIMATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY IS REPRESENTING REGIONAL PROPERTY RATHER THAN THE LOCAL ONE. TO CONFIRM THE VALIDITY OF THE PROPOSED PROCEDURE, IT WAS APPLIED TO THE COASTAL AQUIFER OF JEJU ISLAND, KOREA. THE CALIBRATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITIES WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE RESULTS FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED METHOD IS AN EFFECTIVE AND ECONOMICAL MEANS TO ESTIMATE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY OF LARGE SUPPORTING VOLUMES OF SUBSURFACE AQUIFERS WITH THE CONVENIENT USE OF RECHARGE AND GROUNDWATER LEVEL DATA.

HOWEVER, ECOSYSTEMS AND HUMAN SETTLEMENTS IN COASTAL REGIONS CAN BE VULNERABLE TO NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS TSUNAMIS. AROUND INDONESIA, SEISMIC ACTIVITY UNDER THE INDIAN OCEAN HAS CAUSED FREQUENT EARTHQUAKES AND TSUNAMIS. IN THIS PAPER, WE DESCRIBE A GIS BASED MULTI CRITERIA ANALYSIS OF TSUNAMI VULNERABILITY FOR THE JEMBRANA REGENCY IN BALI, INDONESIA. WE USED MULTIPLE GEOSPATIAL VARIABLES OF TOPOGRAPHIC ELEVATION AND SLOPE, TOPOGRAPHIC RELATION TO TSUNAMI DIRECTION, COASTAL PROXIMITY, AND COASTAL SHAPE. WE ALSO INCORPORATED EXPERT KNOWLEDGE BY THE ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS (AHP) TO CONSTRUCT A WEIGHTING SCHEME FOR THE GEOSPATIAL VARIABLES. IN ORDER TO EXAMINE TSUNAMI VULNERABILITY IN RELATION TO LAND USE, WE OVERLAID AN OFFICIAL LAND USE MAP ON THE TSUNAMI VULNERABILITY MAP. BUILDINGS AS WELL AS RESIDENTIAL AND AGRICULTURAL AREAS WERE FOUND TO BE PARTICULARLY AT RISK IN OUR STUDY AREA. GIS BASED ANALYSES CAN AID IN A WIDE RANGE OF DISASTER ASSESSMENT AND FACILITATE REGIONAL PLANNING FOR MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION OF NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS TSUNAMIS. WE EXPECT THAT THE TSUNAMI VULNERABILITY MAP PRESENTED HERE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO PRELIMINARY TSUNAMI MITIGATION AND MANAGEMENT EFFORTS IN THE JEMBRANA REGENCY.	***

WATER SAMPLES WERE OBTAINED BY MULTILEVEL SAMPLER UNDER NATURAL GRADIENT FLOW CONDITIONS FROM A MONITORING WELL WHICH PENETRATES THE ENTIRE AQUIFER. THE VERTICAL CHEMICAL VARIABILITY DETECTED AT A SINGLE POINT IN TIME IN THIS WELL WAS FOUND TO BE SIMILAR TO THE RANGE OF CONCENTRATIONS DETECTED FOR CL ( ) IN PUMPING WELLS LOCATED OVER AN AREA OF ABOUT 1,000 KM(2) IN THE SAME AQUIFER. SIMILARLY, VERTICAL VARIATIONS IN NO(3)( ) CONCENTRATION IN THE SINGLE MONITORING WELL REPRESENT MORE THAN 50% OF THE TOTAL VARIATION IN NITRATE LEVELS IN PUMPING WELLS SAMPLED ACROSS THE ENTIRE AQUIFER.

LACK OF STRONG PREDICTIVE TOOLS, OR PERHAPS THE LACK OF EXPERIENCED USERS OF THOSE TOOLS, MAY CONTRIBUTE TO PROBLEMS IN DATA INTERPRETATION AND FAILURE TO REACH CONSENSUS ABOUT THE NEED FOR KEY WATER MANAGEMENT ACTIONS. THEREFORE, IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO COMPREHEND THE SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATIONS OF THE WATER LEVEL FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF GROUNDWATER IN THE COASTAL AREAS. IN THIS ARTICLE, A HYBRID, ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK GEOSTATISTICS METHODOLOGY IS PRESENTED FOR SPATIOTEMPORAL PREDICTION OF GROUNDWATER LEVELS. THE PROPOSED MODEL CONTAINS TWO SEPARATED STAGES. AT THE FIRST STAGE, AN ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK IS TRAINED FOR EACH PIEZOMETER FOR TIME SERIES MODELING OF THE WATER LEVEL, SO THAT THE MODEL CAN PREDICT THE GROUNDWATER LEVEL THE NEXT MONTH. AT THE SECOND STAGE, PREDICTED VALUES OF WATER LEVELS AT DIFFERENT PIEZOMETERS ARE IMPOSED TO A CALIBRATED GEOSTATISTICS MODEL IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE GROUNDWATER LEVEL AT ANY DESIRED POINT IN THE PLAIN. THIS METHODOLOGY IS APPLIED FOR THE SHABESTAR PLAIN, WHICH ADJOINS TO URMIEH LAKE AS A COASTAL AQUIFER IN EAST AZERBAIJAN PROVINCE, IRAN. THE MOST APPROPRIATE SET OF INPUT VARIABLES TO THE MODEL ARE SELECTED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE AND AVAILABLE DATA SERIES. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE FEED FORWARD NEURAL NETWORK TRAINED WITH LEVENBERG MARQUARDT ALGORITHM FOR TEMPORAL AND KRIGING SCHEME FOR SPATIAL MODELING ARE GOOD CHOICES FOR PREDICTING GROUNDWATER LEVELS IN THE COASTAL AQUIFER.	***

PROCESS BASED WATERSHED MODELS ARE OFTEN USED FOR THIS PURPOSE. ONE OF THE MAIN INPUTS TO THESE MODELS IS THE SPATIALLY EXPLICIT SOILS DATA. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE USE OF TWO COMMONLY USED SOIL DATA SETS, THE STATE SOIL GEOGRAPHIC (STATSGO) AND THE SOIL SURVEY GEOGRAPHIC (SSURGO) DATA, CAN LEAD TO DIFFERENCES IN LOCATION OF CSAS OF SEDIMENT. A WATERSHED MODEL, SOIL AND WATER ASSESSMENT TOOL (SWAT), IN COMBINATION WITH THE TUKEY KRAMER TEST WAS USED FOR LOCATING CSAS IN THE FISH RIVER WATERSHED LOCATED IN COASTAL ALABAMA. THE MODEL WAS CALIBRATED AND VALIDATED USING FLOW DATA FROM A U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY (USGS) GAUGING STATION LOCATED WITHIN THE WATERSHED. THE LOCATIONS OF THE CSAS OF SEDIMENT WERE ANALYZED AT SUBWATERSHED AND HYDROLOGIC RESPONSE UNIT (HRU) LEVELS. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE LOCATIONS OF THE CSAS WERE DIFFERENT FOR THE TWO SOIL DATA SETS. THE LOCATIONS OF THE CSAS VARIED AT BOTH SUBWATERSHED AND HRU LEVELS. THE USE OF STATSGO SOIL DATA RESULTED IN HIGHER SOIL ERODIBILITY FACTOR AND SURFACE RUNOFF. AS A RESULT, HIGHER SEDIMENT YIELD WAS OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE STATSGO DATA AS COMPARED WITH THE SEDIMENT YIELD OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SSURGO DATA. THEREFORE, FOR ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION OF CSAS OF SEDIMENT (AND POTENTIALLY OTHER POLLUTANTS) AND FOR EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE BMPS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO USE THE MOST DETAILED SPATIAL DATA SET AVAILABLE.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS A MANAGEMENT MODEL WITH THE ECONOMIC OBJECTIVE OF MAXIMISING THE NET BENEFIT DERIVED FROM A PUMPED FRESHWATER VOLUME WHILE ELIMINATING THE UTILITY COST IN COASTAL AQUIFERS THREATENED BY SALTWATER INTRUSION. BECAUSE THE SEARCH SPACE IS BOTH DISCONTINUOUS AND EXTREMELY WIDE, AND ALSO CONTAINS NUMEROUS LOCAL MINIMA, EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS CAN BE HELPFUL IN THE SEARCH FOR NEAR OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS. IN THIS PAPER, A SIMULATION MODEL OF THE SHARP SALTWATER FRESHWATER INTERFACE IS CONSIDERED TO BE TIME INDEPENDENT. MOREOVER, THE HONEY BEE MATING OPTIMISATION (HBMO) ALGORITHM IS APPLIED TO A TEST CASE AND THE RESULTS ARE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF A PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED GENETIC ALGORITHM (GA) FOR THE SAME CASE. THE COMPARISON INDICATES THAT THE HBMO ALGORITHM CAN BE EFFECTIVELY USED TO OBTAIN NEAR GLOBAL OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS FOR THE PROBLEM UNDER CONSIDERATION. THE HBMO ALGORITHM IS THEN APPLIED TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE COASTAL AQUIFER UNDERLYING THE CITY OF MIAMI BEACH IN NORTHEASTERN SPAIN. COMPARED WITH THE GA, THE HBMO ALGORITHM RESULTS SHOW A SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER PERFORMANCE AND ADVANTAGES IN TERMS OF BOTH THE FINAL OBJECTIVE FUNCTION VALUE (MORE BENEFIT) OBTAINED AND TOTAL PUMPED DISCHARGE FROM THE SYSTEM. FURTHERMORE, THE EFFICIENCY OF THE HBMO ALGORITHM IN HANDLING NON LINEAR DISCONTINUOUS GROUND WATER SIMULATION/OPTIMISATION PROBLEMS MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN THE GA IS A PROMISING POINT FOR FURTHER USE OF THE ALGORITHM IN THE FIELD OF GROUNDWATER OPTIMISATION.	***

GROUNDWATER WITHDRAWAL FOR MEETING THIS DEMAND OFTEN CAUSES SEAWATER INTRUSION AND DEGRADATION OF WATER QUALITY OF COASTAL AQUIFERS. IN ORDER TO SATISFY DEMAND, A COMBINED MANAGEMENT PLAN IS PROPOSED AND IS UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR THE ISLAND OF SANTORINI. THE PLAN INVOLVES: (1) DESALINIZATION (IF NEEDED) OF PUMPED WATER TO A POTABLE LEVEL USING REVERSE OSMOSIS AND (2) INJECTION INTO THE AQUIFER OF BIOLOGICALLY TREATED WASTE WATER. THE MANAGEMENT PLAN IS FORMULATED IN A MULTI OBJECTIVE, OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK, WHERE SIMULTANEOUS MINIMIZATION OF ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS IS DESIRED, SUBJECT TO A CONSTRAINT SO THAT CLEANED WATER SATISFIES DEMAND. THE DECISION VARIABLES CONCERN THE WELL LOCATIONS AND THE CORRESPONDING PUMPING AND RECHARGING RATES. THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED USING A COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT, MULTI OBJECTIVE, GENETIC ALGORITHM (NSGAII). THE CONSTRAINED MULTI OBJECTIVE, OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM IS TRANSFORMED TO AN UNCONSTRAINED ONE USING A PENALTY FUNCTION PROPORTIONAL TO CONSTRAINT VIOLATION. THIS EXTENDS THE DEFINITION OF THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION OUTSIDE THE DOMAIN OF FEASIBILITY. THE IMPACT OF PROLONGED DROUGHTS ON COASTAL AQUIFERS IS INVESTIGATED BY ASSUMING VARIOUS SCENARIOS OF REDUCED GROUNDWATER RECHARGE. WATER FLOW AND QUALITY IN THE COASTAL AQUIFER IS SIMULATED USING A THREE DIMENSIONAL, VARIABLE DENSITY, FINITE DIFFERENCE MODEL (SEAWAT). THE METHOD IS INITIALLY APPLIED TO A TEST AQUIFER AND THE TRADE OFF CURVES (PARETO FRONTS) ARE DETERMINEDL FOR EACH DROUGHT SCENARIO. THE TRADE OFF CURVES INDICATE AN INCREASE ON THE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL COST AS GROUNDWATER RECHARGE REDUCES DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE.	***

THIS RESEARCH HYPOTHESIZES THAT THE COMPLEX EFFECTS OF SURFACE WATER AND SHALLOW GROUNDWATER ON THE SOIL MOISTURE DYNAMICS OF FLOODPLAIN WETLANDS ARE SPATIALLY COMPLEMENTARY. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, 31 LONG TERM (4 YEAR) HYDROLOGICAL TIME SERIES WERE COLLECTED IN THE FLOODPLAIN OF THE LOXAHATCHEE RIVER (FLORIDA, USA), WHERE WATERSHED MODIFICATIONS HAVE LED TO REDUCED FRESHWATER FLOW, ALTERED HYDROPERIOD AND SALINITY, AND A DEGRADED ECOSYSTEM.

THE RESULTING DYNAMIC FACTOR MODELS YIELDED GOOD PREDICTIONS OF OBSERVED SOIL MOISTURE SERIES (OVERALL COEFFICIENT OF EFFICIENCY 0.90) BY IDENTIFYING SURFACE WATER ELEVATION, GROUNDWATER ELEVATION, AND NET RECHARGE (CUMULATIVE RAINFALL CUMULATIVE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION) AS IMPORTANT EXPLANATORY VARIABLES. STRONG AND COMPLEMENTARY LINEAR RELATIONSHIPS WERE FOUND BETWEEN FLOODPLAIN ELEVATION AND SURFACE WATER EFFECTS (SLOPE 0.72, R 2 0.86, P < 0.001), AND BETWEEN ELEVATION AND GROUNDWATER EFFECTS (SLOPE 0.71, R 2 0.71, P 0.001), WHILE THE EFFECT OF NET RECHARGE WAS HOMOGENOUS ACROSS THE EXPERIMENTAL TRANSECT (SLOPE 0.03, R 2 0.05, P 0.242). THIS STUDY PROVIDES A QUANTITATIVE INSIGHT INTO THE SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF GROUNDWATER AND SURFACE WATER EFFECTS ON SOIL MOISTURE THAT WILL BE USEFUL FOR REFINING MONITORING PLANS AND DEVELOPING ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION AND MANAGEMENT SCENARIOS IN DEGRADED COASTAL FLOODPLAINS.

A NEW PROCESS BASED CLASSIFICATION SCHEME BASED ON THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PRIMARY, SECONDARY, AND TERTIARY PROCESSES IS PRESENTED. THIS SCHEME PERMITS A SEMIQUANTITATIVE CLASSIFICATION OF ELASTIC COASTAL DEPOSITIONAL SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, IT PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR NEW MODELS FOR CLASTIC SHORELINES THAT CONVOLVE THE EFFECTS OF BASIN SHAPE, COASTAL MORPHOLOGY, ACCOMMODATION SPACE, SEDIMENT SUPPLY, SHORELINE TRAJECTORY, AND SHELF WIDTH PARAMETERS ON DEPOSITIONAL PROCESSES. THE END RESULT IS A MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN THE PREDICTIVE CAPABILITIES OF MODELS. THE MODELS CAN DESCRIBE AND PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD OF PRIMARY, SECONDARY, AND TERTIARY DEPOSITIONAL PROCESSES ACTING IN SHORELINE DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENTS VIA EITHER A MATRIX OR A DECISION TREE APPROACH. THEY ARE ALSO DYNAMIC IN NATURE AND CAN BE APPLIED TO PREDICT ALONG STRIKE, UPDIP, AND DOWNDIP, OR VERTICAL CHANGES IN THE DOMINANCE OF DEPOSITIONAL PROCESSES ACTING AT ANY GIVEN LOCATION THROUGH GEOLOGIC TIME. THE KEY IMPLICATIONS OF THESE MODELS ARE THAT GIVEN SETS OF KNOWN PARAMETERS, DOMINANT AND SUBORDINATE DEPOSITIONAL PROCESSES OR RANGES OF POTENTIAL DOMINANT AND SUBORDINATE DEPOSITIONAL PROCESSES ACTING AT A COASTLINE CAN BE PREDICTED. THIS PROVIDES AN AUDITABLE METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING RESERVOIR MODELING SCENARIOS AND REDUCING AND MANAGING THE UNCERTAINTIES IN PREDICTIONS OF CHANGES IN CLASTIC COASTAL DEPOSITIONAL PROCESSES THROUGH TIME AND SPACE.	***

IN THIS STUDY, BENTHIC COMMUNITIES ON SIX BREAKWATERS RANGING FROM 1 TO 31 YEARS OF AGE WERE COMPARED TO PROVIDE AN UNDERSTANDING OF PATTERNS OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ON ENGINEERED COASTAL DEFENSES, AND THESE WERE COMPARED TO COMMUNITIES ON NATURAL REEFS TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW COMMUNITIES DEVELOP ON ARTIFICIAL STRUCTURES RELATIVE TO THOSE IN NATURAL HABITATS. MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES INDICATED THAT BENTHIC COMMUNITIES ON BREAKWATERS BECAME MORE SIMILAR TO NATURAL REEFS WITH INCREASING AGE, BUT THAT COMMUNITIES ON EVEN THE MOST MATURE (31 YEARS) BREAKWATER WERE DISTINCT FROM THOSE ON NATURAL REEFS (ANOSIM P < 0.001). GENERALLY, BREAKWATERS < 5.5 YEARS HAD HIGHER ABUNDANCE OF TURF ALGAE, SPONGES, BIVALVES, AND BARE PAVEMENT, WHILE MORE MATURE (> 25 YEARS) BREAKWATERS WERE DOMINATED BY CORALS. CORAL COVER ON 25 AND 31 YEARS OLD BREAKWATERS (46% AND 56%, RESPECTIVELY) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN ON NATURAL REEFS (37%; HSD TEST P < 0.05 AND P < 0.001, RESPECTIVELY). THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT BREAKWATERS DEVELOP BENTHIC COMMUNITIES THAT CONTINUE TO CHANGE OVER PERIODS EXCEEDING 31 YEARS, AND THAT ALTHOUGH THEY BECOME MORE SIMILAR TO COMMUNITIES ON NATURAL REEFS WITH INCREASING AGE, THESE COMMUNITIES REMAIN DISTINCT.

IT IS ALSO A MAJOR CENTER FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY. THE INCREASING ARRAY OF ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES MAY HAVE SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON MARINE ECOSYSTEMS, BUT THIS HAS RECEIVED LITTLE ATTENTION UNTIL RECENTLY. WE REVIEW THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE ON THE GULFS MARINE ENVIRONMENT AND DETAIL OUR RECENT EXPERIENCE IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (U.A.E.) TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE IN THIS MARINE ECOSYSTEM. EXTENSIVE COASTAL DEVELOPMENT MAY NOW BE THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ANTHROPOGENIC STRESSOR. WE OFFER SUGGESTIONS FOR HOW TO BUILD AWARENESS OF ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS OF CURRENT PRACTICES, ENHANCE REGIONAL CAPACITY FOR COASTAL MANAGEMENT, AND BUILD COOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT OF THIS IMPORTANT, SHARED MARINE SYSTEM. AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY EXISTS FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE BORDERING COUNTRIES TO INITIATE A BOLD AND EFFECTIVE, LONG TERM, INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT FOR THE GULF.	***

IN THIS PAPER, THE UTILIZATION OF ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERING SPECIES FOR ACHIEVING CIVIL ENGINEERING OBJECTIVES OR THE FACILITATION OF MULTIPLE USE OF LIMITED SPACE IN COASTAL PROTECTION IS FOCUSED UPON, EITHER BY USING ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERING SPECIES THAT TRAP SEDIMENT AND DAMP WAVES (OYSTER BEDS, MUSSEL BEDS, WILLOW FLOODPLAINS AND MARRAM GRASS), OR BY ADJUSTING HARD SUBSTRATES TO ENHANCE ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING. TRANSLATING DESIRED COASTAL PROTECTION FUNCTIONALITY INTO DESIGNS THAT MAKE USE OF THE CAPABILITY OF APPROPRIATE ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERING SPECIES IS, HOWEVER, HAMPERED BY LACK OF A GENERIC FRAMEWORK TO DECIDE WHICH ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERING SPECIES OR WHAT TYPE OF HARD SUBSTRATE ADAPTATIONS MAY BE USED WHERE AND WHEN.

HOWEVER, DEBATE EXISTS WHETHER THIS IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE METRIC TO USE. IN THIS STUDY, A STORM WATER WETLAND CONSTRUCTED AND MONITORED IN THE COASTAL PLAIN OF NORTH CAROLINA IS EVALUATED FOR WATER QUALITY AND HYDROLOGIC PERFORMANCE USING FOUR DIFFERENT METRICS: CONCENTRATION REDUCTION, LOAD REDUCTION, COMPARISON TO NEARBY AMBIENT WATER QUALITY MONITORING STATIONS, AND COMPARISON TO OTHER WETLANDS STUDIED IN NORTH CAROLINA. THE RIVER BEND STORM WATER WETLAND WAS CONSTRUCTED IN SPRING 2007 AND WAS MONITORED FROM JUNE 2007 THROUGH MAY 2008. TWENTY FOUR HYDROLOGIC AND 11 WATER QUALITY EVENTS WERE CAPTURED AND EVALUATED. THE WETLAND REDUCED PEAK FLOWS AND RUNOFF VOLUMES BY 80 AND 54%, RESPECTIVELY. REDUCTIONS WERE SIGNIFICANT. CONCENTRATIONS FOR THE FOLLOWING POLLUTANTS INCREASED: TOTAL KJELDAHL NITROGEN (TKN), NH(4) N, TOTAL NITROGEN (TN), AND TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLIDS (TSS); INFLOW AND OUTFLOW CONCENTRATIONS DID NOT CHANGE FOR TOTAL PHOSPHORUS (TP), WHILE ONLY NO(2 3) N AND ORTHOPHOSPHORUS (OP) CONCENTRATIONS WERE LOWER AT THE OUTLET. USING A LOAD REDUCTION METRIC, RESULTS WERE STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT, SHOWING POSITIVE LOAD REDUCTIONS OF 35, 41, 42, 36, 47, 61, AND 49% FOR THESE RESPECTIVE POLLUTANTS: TKN, NO(2 3) N, NH(4) N, TN, TP, OP, AND TSS. WHEN COMPARING THE EFFLUENT CONCENTRATIONS FROM THE WETLAND TO AMBIENT WATER QUALITY IN THE TRENT RIVER, ALL EFFLUENT NITROGEN SPECIES CONCENTRATION WERE EITHER SIMILAR OR LOWER. TP AND TSS CONCENTRATIONS LEAVING THE WETLAND WERE HIGHER THAN AMBIENT WATER QUALITY DATA. FINALLY, BY COMPARING POLLUTANT CONCENTRATIONS AMONG DIFFERENT NORTH CAROLINA WETLANDS, IT IS APPARENT THE RIVER BEND WETLAND RECEIVED RELATIVELY CLEAN WATER AND RELEASED WATER WITH POLLUTANT CONCENTRATIONS COMPARABLE TO ALL OTHER STUDIES EXAMINED. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS FROM THIS STUDY INCLUDE: (1) STORM WATER WETLANDS SITED IN SANDIER SOILS (SUCH AS THOSE OF THE NORTH CAROLINA COASTAL PLAIN) SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT TOOL AND (2) THE SELECTION OF PERFORMANCE METRIC HAS A PRONOUNCED BEARING ON HOW A BMPS PERFORMANCE IS PERCEIVED. SOLE RELIANCE ON A CONCENTRATION REDUCTION METRIC IS DISCOURAGED.	***

CURRENT MONITORING TECHNIQUES RELY ON THE TIME INTENSIVE CULTURING OF FECAL INDICATOR BACTERIA (FIB) FROM WATER SAMPLES, BUT RAPIDLY CHANGING FIB CONCENTRATIONS RESULT IN MANAGEMENT ERRORS THAT LEAD TO THE PUBLIC BEING EXPOSED TO HIGH FIB CONCENTRATIONS (TYPE II ERROR) OR BEACHES BEING CLOSED DESPITE ACCEPTABLE WATER QUALITY (TYPE I ERROR). EMPIRICAL PREDICTIVE MODELS MAY PROVIDE A RAPID SOLUTION, BUT THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AT IMPROVING HEALTH PROTECTION HAS NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY ASSESSED. WE SOUGHT TO DETERMINE IF EMERGING MONITORING APPROACHES COULD EFFECTIVELY REDUCE RISK OF ILLNESS EXPOSURE BY MINIMIZING MANAGEMENT ERRORS. WE EXAMINED FOUR MONITORING APPROACHES (INACTIVE, CURRENT PROTOCOL, A SINGLE PREDICTIVE MODEL FOR ALL BEACHES, AND INDIVIDUAL MODELS FOR EACH BEACH) WITH INCREASING REFINEMENT AT 14 CHICAGO BEACHES USING HISTORICAL MONITORING AND HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL DATA AND COMPARED MANAGEMENT OUTCOMES USING DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR DECISION MAKING. PREDICTABILITY (R(2)) OF FIB CONCENTRATION IMPROVED WITH MODEL REFINEMENT AT ALL BEACHES BUT ONE. PREDICTIVE MODELS DID NOT ALWAYS REDUCE THE NUMBER OF MANAGEMENT ERRORS AND THEREFORE THE OVERALL ILLNESS BURDEN. USE OF A CHICAGO SPECIFIC SINGLE SAMPLE STANDARD RATHER THAN THE DEFAULT 235 E. COB CFU/100 ML WIDELY USED TOGETHER WITH PREDICTIVE MODELING RESULTED IN THE GREATEST NUMBER OF OPEN BEACH DAYS WITHOUT ANY INCREASE IN PUBLIC HEALTH RISK. THESE RESULTS EMPHASIZE THAT EMERGING MONITORING APPROACHES SUCH AS EMPIRICAL MODELS ARE NOT EQUALLY APPLICABLE AT ALL BEACHES, AND COMBINING MONITORING APPROACHES MAY EXPAND BEACH ACCESS.

SULPHIDIC SOILS OXIDIZE WHEN FLOODPLAINS ARE DRAINED FOR URBAN AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT. AS A RESULT, LARGE AMOUNTS OF SULPHURIC ACID MAY BE RELEASED TO NEARBY WATERWAYS. MACROPORES MAY CREATE EXCELLENT CONDITIONS FOR GROUNDWATER FLOW IN COASTAL ACID SULPHATE SOILS (CASS). AN AUTOMATED RADON ((222)RN) MEASUREMENT SYSTEM WAS USED TO QUANTIFY GROUNDWATER INPUTS INTO A TIDALLY DOMINATED ESTUARY THAT IS KNOWN TO BE INFLUENCED BY ACID DISCHARGES FROM CASS (RICHMOND RIVER ESTUARY, AUSTRALIA). A HIGH RESOLUTION RADON SURVEY ALONG A 120 KM LONG SEGMENT OF THE TIDAL RIVER IDENTIFIED TWO AREAS OF PREFERENTIAL GROUNDWATER INPUTS. INTENSIVE TIME SERIES MEASUREMENTS IN ONE OF THOSE AREAS (THE TUCKEAN BROADWATER) DEMONSTRATED THAT GROUNDWATER INPUTS ARE HIGHLY VARIABLE OVER HOURLY AND SEASONAL TIME SCALES AND INVERSELY RELATED TO SURFACE WATER PH. ELEVATED RADON CONCENTRATIONS (UP TO 12 DPM/L) AND LOW PH (AS LOW AS 3.3) WERE OBSERVED IN SURFACE WATERS AT LOW TIDE A FEW WEEKS AFTER A LARGE RAIN EVENT. THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT ACIDIC WATERS ARE ENTERING THE ESTUARY VIA TIDALLY MODULATED GROUNDWATER FLOW PATHWAYS. GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE RATES INTO DRAINS IN THE TUCKEAN SWAMP WERE ESTIMATED FROM A DUAL ASSUMPTION RADON MASS BALANCE TO BE 0.09 0.16 AND 0.56 0.89 M(3) S( 1) DURING THE DRY AND WET SEASON, RESPECTIVELY (OR 6 10 AND 37 59 CM/DAY IF THE AREA IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT). WHILE SURFACE RUNOFF INCREASED ONLY 2 FOLD IN THE WET SEASON RELATIVE TO THE DRY SEASON, GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE RATES INCREASED SIMILAR TO 6 FOLD. SINCE GROUNDWATER CAN BE A MAJOR DRIVER OF SURFACE WATER QUALITY, RADON CAN BE USEFUL IN CASS MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT EFFORTS. (C) 2010 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

THE SYSTEM OPERATED A REAL TIME DATA BUOY ARRAY THAT COLLECTED OCEANOGRAPHIC AND METEOROLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS IN A 24/7 OPERATION AT AS MANY AS 11 LOCATIONS IN THE GULF OF MAINE (GOM). THE DATA RETURN OF THE GOM SENSOR ARRAY HAS AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY 90% OVER ITS FIRST DECADE OF OPERATION. IN ADDITION TO THE HOURLY OPERATIONAL DATA DELIVERY TO SEVERAL ONLINE WEBSITES, THE UNIVERSITY OF MAINE PROVIDES AN ARCHIVE OF DATA AND MODEL OUTPUT THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCING THE SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE GOM AS A PHYSICAL AND ECOLOGICAL SYSTEM. OVER THE DECADE OF OPERATION, THE DATA HAVE REVEALED MARKED SEASONAL AND INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY OF THE CIRCULATION AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE GULF. FROM THE TIME OF THE INITIAL DEPLOYMENTS IN THE SUMMER OF 2001, THE GOM BUOY ARRAY HAS BEEN AN UNUSUALLY COMPREHENSIVE SUITE OF OCEANOGRAPHIC SENSORS INCLUDING SURFACE CURRENT METERS, DOPPLER CURRENT PROFILERS FOR SUBSURFACE CURRENTS, TEMPERATURE, SALINITY, DISSOLVED OXYGEN, CHLOROPHYLL AND COLORED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER (CDOM) FLUOROMETERS, RADIOMETERS, MULTI WAVELENGTH ABSORPTION, AND ATTENUATION SENSORS AT MULTIPLE DEPTHS. IN ADDITION, WAVE INSTRUMENTS AND METEOROLOGICAL SENSORS WERE DEPLOYED ON THE BUOYS INCLUDING AIR TEMPERATURE, WIND SPEED AND DIRECTION, ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE, AND FORWARD SCATTERING VISIBILITY. IN RECENT YEARS THE SAMPLING SCHEME OF THE SYSTEM HAS INCREASED IN RESOLUTION BEYOND HOURLY FOR SEVERAL HIGH VALUE DATA STREAMS. THE METEOROLOGICAL DATA ARE COLLECTED AT TEN MINUTE INTERVALS, AND WATER COLUMN TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY ARE MEASURED AT THREE MINUTE INTERVALS TO PROVIDE RECORDS OF INTERNAL WAVE ACTIVITY. THE HIGHER FREQUENCY RECORDS ARE NOT PROVIDED IN REAL TIME. THE FULL TEN MINUTE METEOROLOGICAL DATA ARE UPDATED HOURLY (OR HALF HOURLY DURING STORM EVENTS), AND THE HIGHER FREQUENCY TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY DATA ARE UPDATED SEMIANNUALLY. WAVE MEASUREMENTS HAVE RECENTLY INCLUDED WAVE DIRECTIONAL SPECTRA. THE BROAD SUITE OF SENSORS ON THE GOM INTEGRATED OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM (GOMIOOS) SERVE A WIDE VARIETY OF REAL TIME OCEANOGRAPHIC AND MARINE METEOROLOGICAL DATA AND DATA PRODUCTS TO SCIENTISTS, STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORS, THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE, THE US AND CANADIAN COAST GUARDS, EDUCATORS, REGIONAL NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGERS, THE GULF OF MAINE FISHING AND MARITIME INDUSTRIES, FISHERMEN, BOATERS, AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THE SUCCESS OF THE SYSTEM HAS RESULTED IN AN ENERGIZED AND ENTHUSIASTIC SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL COMMUNITY INVOLVED IN OPERATIONAL OCEAN OBSERVING ACTIVITIES, AND A LARGE USER GROUP WHICH HAVE COME TO DEPEND ON THE REAL TIME DATA STREAMS THE SYSTEM PROVIDES. THE FIRST DECADE OF DATA COLLECTED BY THE GOMIOOS HAS PROVIDED A WEALTH OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION, AND LEAD TO A NEW UNDERSTATING IN OF THE OCEANOGRAPHY OF THE GOM. IN MANY CASES THE BUOY ARRAY PROVIDED THE FIRST BASELINE INFORMATION AS WELL AS THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE CHARACTERIZATIONS OF MARKED SEASONAL AND INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY OF THE CIRCULATION AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE GULF. BETWEEN THE FALL OF 2004 AND SPRING OF 2005 DOPPLER CURRENTS MEASURED, FOR THE FIRST TIME, OUTFLOW OF DEEP SALTY SLOPE WATERS THAT SUGGESTED A REGIME SHIFT IN THE TRANSPORTS THROUGH THE NORTHEAST CHANNEL (NEC). EXPERIMENTS FROM EARLIER DECADES CONSISTENTLY OBSERVED INFLOW OF DENSE SLOPE WATERS THROUGHOUT ALL SEASONS. DURING THE SAME PERIOD A SALINITY ANOMALY EVENT LOWERED SALINITY THROUGHOUT THE GOM BY ROUGHLY 2 PSU BY THE WINTER OF 2005. IN FOLLOWING YEARS, THE PREVIOUSLY UNUSUAL SLOPE OUTFLOW AND REDUCED SALINITY HAVE OFTEN REOCCURRED. THESE MODERN MEASUREMENTS ARE OCEANOGRAPHIC ANOMALIES THAT SUGGEST CLIMATE CHANGE MAY BE CAUSING SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATIONS. OCEAN SENSORS, OCEAN PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES, AND MODELING AND VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES ARE IN A PERIOD OF RAPID TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT. IF STABLE FUNDING CAN BE ACHIEVED, THE CAPABILITIES OF OPERATIONAL OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEMS WILL INCREASE DRAMATICALLY OVER THE NEXT DECADE. AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES COULD BECOME THE FAST RESPONSE SURVEY FLEET OF THE INTEGRATED OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM (IOOS (R)), AS WELL AS THE WORKHORSES FOR ROUTINE, SUSTAINED, MARINE SURVEY FUNCTIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE USING RESEARCH VESSELS. PRACTICAL AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES WILL LIKELY EXPAND BEYOND GLIDERS AND PROPELLER DRIVEN AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES (AUVS) TO INCLUDE AUTONOMOUS SURFACE VESSELS (ASVS). THE COMBINATION OF TIME SERIES MEASUREMENTS FROM PROFILING PACKAGES ON BUOY ARRAYS WITH THE REPEATED SPATIAL SURVEYS OF THE AUTONOMOUS FLEETS WILL PROVIDE A NEW LOOK AT OUR COASTAL OCEANS THAT COULD TRANSFORM COASTAL OCEAN SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT.	***

WFD AIMS TO PROVIDE A COMMON FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROTECTION AND IMPROVEMENT OF SURFACE WATERS (RIVERS, LAKES, TRANSITIONAL WATERS AND COASTAL WATERS) AND GROUNDWATERS IN EUROPE. CONSEQUENTLY, MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ESTABLISH THE CURRENT STATUS OF WATER BODIES THROUGH SYSTEMATIC MONITORING NETWORKS THAT GENERATE TEMPORAL SERIES OF HUGE AMOUNT OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION THAT MUST BE MANAGED EFFICIENTLY. GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS (GIS) HAVE BEEN A KEY COMPONENT OF THE MANAGEMENT PROCESS DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WFD AND NATURA 2000 NETWORK IN CANTABRIA. THE EVOLUTION OF GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SOFTWARE OVER THE LAST DECADES HAS BEEN EVIDENT; FROM ISOLATED DESKTOP GI SOFTWARE TO EUROPEAN SPATIAL DATA INFRASTRUCTURES (SDI), ALLOWING SCIENTISTS, MANAGERS, ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERTS AND PARTNERS TO OBTAIN NEW GIS CAPABILITIES TO MANAGE ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION. THIS PAPER IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE SPECIALLY FOCUSED ON ANSWERING ENVIRONMENTAL EUROPEAN DIRECTIVES. THE ENVIRONMENTAL DATA IS MANAGED THROUGH A RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS) AND A GIS SERVER. THESE TWO COMPONENTS ALLOW THE CENTRALIZATION OF DATA AND CREATION OF SERVICES THAT CAN BE EXPLOITED FROM DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS. SCIENTISTS AND MANAGERS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE INFORMATION THROUGH HEAVIER WEIGHT DESKTOP CLIENTS OR THROUGH WEB CLIENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY. CONSEQUENTLY, A MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BEEN BUILT TO MANAGE ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION OF THE CANTABRIA REGION. ENVIRONMENTAL PROFESSIONALS CAN ACCESS SPECIFIC WEB SITES THAT ANSWER THE NEEDS OF EUROPEAN DIRECTIVES WHEREAS PUBLIC WEB SITES RETRIEVE ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE SYSTEM. THE ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION SYSTEM PRESENTED ALLOWS RESEARCHERS AND MANAGERS TO MANAGE LARGE AMOUNTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION, IMPLEMENT METHODOLOGICAL PROCEDURES TO ANSWER ENVIRONMENTAL EUROPEAN DIRECTIVES AND PROVIDE INTEROPERABILITY PROTOCOLS TO SHARE ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION.

HOWEVER, LITTLE CONCERN FOCUSES ON THIS IN CHINA. THE PARABOLIC RELATIONSHIP IS THE MOST WIDELY USED EMPIRICAL RELATIONSHIP FOR DETERMINING THE STATIC EQUILIBRIUM SHAPE OF HEADLAND BAY BEACHES. THIS PAPER UTILIZES THE RELATION TO PREDICT AND CLASSIFY 31 HEADLAND BAY BEACHES AND CONCLUDES THAT THESE BAYS CANNOT ACHIEVE THE ULTIMATE STATIC EQUILIBRIUM PLANFORM IN SOUTH CHINA. THE EMPIRICAL BAY EQUATION CAN MORPHOLOGICALLY ESTIMATE BEACH STABILIZATION STATE, BUT IT IS JUST A REFERENTIAL PREDICTABLE MEANS AND IS DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE HEADLAND BAY SHORELINE MOVEMENTS IN YEARS AND DECADES. BY USING DIGITAL SHORELINE ANALYSIS SYSTEM SUGGESTED BY USGS, THE RATES OF SHORELINE RECESSION AND ACCRETION OF THESE DIFFERENT HEADLAND BAY BEACHES ARE QUANTITATIVELY CALCULATED FROM 1990 TO 2000. THE CONCLUSIONS OF THIS PAPER INCLUDE THAT (A) MOST OF THESE 31 BAYS MAINTAIN RELATIVELY STABLE AND THE RATES OF EROSION AND ACCRETION ARE RELATIVELY LARGE WITH THE IMPACT OF MAN MADE CONSTRUCTIONS ON ESTUARINE WITHIN THESE BAYS FROM 1990 TO 2000; (B) TWO BAYS, HAIMEN BAY AND HAILINGSHAN BAY, ORIGINALLY IN THE QUASI STATIC EQUILIBRIUM PLANFORM DETERMINED BY THE PARABOLIC BAY SHAPE EQUATION, HAVE BEEN UNSTABLE BY THE INFLUENCE OF COASTAL ENGINEERING; AND (C) THESE 31 BAYS HAVE DIFFERENT RECESSION AND ACCRETION CHARACTERS OCCURRING IN SOME BAYS AND SOME SEGMENTS. ON THE ONE HAND, SOME BAYS TOTALLY EXHIBIT ACCRETION, BUT SOME BAYS SHOW EROSION ON THE WHOLE. SHANWEI BAY, HOUMEN BAY, PINGHAI BAY AND YAZHOU BAY HAVE THE SIMILAR PLANFORMS, CHARACTERIZED BY LESS ACCRETION ON THE SHELTERING SEGMENT AND BIGGER ACCRETION ON THE TRANSITIONAL AND TANGENTIAL SEGMENTS. ON THE OTHER HAND, DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF SOME BAYS HAVE TWO DISSIMILAR EVOLVEMENT CHARACTERS. DACHENG BAY, SHENQUAN BAY, HUDONG BAY, WUKAN BAY, FENGJIA BAY, WUCHANG BAY, LINGSHUI BAY AND TUFT BAY PRODUCE ACCRETION ON THE TANGENTIAL SEGMENT, EROSION ON THE TRANSITIONAL SEGMENT AND ACCRETION ON THE SHELTERING SEGMENT. HOWEVER, GUANGAO BAY, HAIMEN BAY, JINGHAI BAY, SANYA BAY(A), DAJIAO BAY, HAILINGSHAN BAY, HEBEI BAY, FUHU BAY, SHUIDONG BAY, WANGCUN BAY AND BOMAO BAY GENERATE EROSION ON THE TANGENTIAL PART, ACCRETION ON THE TRANSITIONAL PART AND ACCRETION ON THE SHELTERING PART. IT SEEMS TO IMPLY SOME RELATIONS BETWEEN HEADLAND BAY BEACH EVOLVEMENT AND CONTROLS ON HEADLAND BAY BEACHES, WHICH MAY POSSIBLY TO CLASSIFY HEADLAND BAY BEACH TYPES AND SHOULD BE FURTHER STUDIED.	***

RECENTLY, SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING DATA HAVE EMERGED AS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE OR SUPPLEMENT TO IN SITU OBSERVATIONS DUE TO THEIR AVAILABILITY OVER VAST UNGAUGED REGIONS. THE FOCUS OF THIS STUDY IS TO INTEGRATE THE BEST AVAILABLE SATELLITE PRODUCTS WITHIN A DISTRIBUTED HYDROLOGIC MODEL TO CHARACTERIZE THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF FLOODING AND ASSOCIATED HAZARDS OVER SPARSELY GAUGED OR UNGAUGED BASINS. WE PRESENT A METHODOLOGY BASED ENTIRELY ON SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING DATA TO SET UP AND CALIBRATE A HYDROLOGIC MODEL, SIMULATE THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF FLOODING, AND EVALUATE THE PROBABILITY OF DETECTING INUNDATED AREAS. A RASTER BASED DISTRIBUTED HYDROLOGIC MODEL, COUPLED ROUTING AND EXCESS STORAGE (CREST), WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR THE NZOIA BASIN, A SUBBASIN OF LAKE VICTORIA IN AFRICA. MODERATE RESOLUTION IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER TERRA BASED AND ADVANCED SPACEBORNE THERMAL EMISSION AND REFLECTION RADIOMETER BASED FLOOD INUNDATION MAPS WERE PRODUCED OVER THE REGION AND USED TO BENCHMARK THE DISTRIBUTED HYDROLOGIC MODEL SIMULATIONS OF INUNDATION AREAS. THE ANALYSIS SHOWED THE VALUE OF INTEGRATING SATELLITE DATA SUCH AS PRECIPITATION, LAND COVER TYPE, TOPOGRAPHY, AND OTHER PRODUCTS ALONG WITH SPACE BASED FLOOD INUNDATION EXTENTS AS INPUTS TO THE DISTRIBUTED HYDROLOGIC MODEL. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE QUANTIFICATION OF FLOODING SPATIAL EXTENT THROUGH OPTICAL SENSORS CAN HELP TO CALIBRATE AND EVALUATE HYDROLOGIC MODELS AND, HENCE, POTENTIALLY IMPROVE HYDROLOGIC PREDICTION AND FLOOD MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES IN UNGAUGED CATCHMENTS.	***

DATABASE CAN BE LOOKED UP BY EUROPEAN AND RUSSIAN USERS (HTTP://WWW.E URAL.VSU.RU/EN/UFORMS/APPFORRNS/SEARCH) BY SEVERAL SEARCH KEYS (E.G. RESEARCH SUBJECT, GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION) AND THE COMPLETE INFORMATION (CONTACT INFORMATION, INFORMATION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SCIENTISTS ORGANISATION, EXPERTISE OFFERED, PREVIOUS AND PRESENT EXPERIENCE IN THE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, ETC.) OF THE RUSSIAN PROFILES IS OBTAINED. IN ADDITION, THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS EQUALLY INSTRUMENTAL FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF RESEARCH NEEDS AS WELL AS PRIORITIES AND OBSTACLES FOR THE EU RUSSIA COOPERATION. TO RAISE AWARENESS AND PROVIDE CAPACITY BUILDING FOR MULTIPLIERS AND RESEARCHERS IN RUSSIA E URAL TOOLS ALSO INCLUDES TRAINING ACTIVITIES. TWO DAYS NATIONAL TRAINING SESSION FOR RUSSIAN RESEARCHERS, GIVING THEM ALL THE NECESSARY INFORMATION TO PARTICIPATE TO FP7, AND IN PARTICULAR TO THE ENV THEME, WERE ORGANIZED IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF RUSSIA. MOREOVER, A SERIES OF THEMATIC WORKSHOPS ON COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT, NATURE AND BIODIVERSITY, CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR SOLID WASTE AND WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT GAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO LOCAL RUSSIAN RESEARCHERS TO MEET WITH HIGHLY EXPERIENCED EU RESEARCHERS (USUALLY COORDINATORS OR QUALIFIED PARTNERS OF EU FP6/FP7 PROJECTS) AND TO DISCUSS RESEARCH THEMES AND COLLABORATION MECHANISMS, AS WELL AS TO BUILD UP NEW PARTNERSHIPS. THE MAIN RESULTS CONCERNING THE PERSPECTIVES AND FUTURES FOR EUROPEAN UNION AND RUSSIA CO OPERATION IN THE AREA OF THE ENVIRONMENT, OBTAINED THROUGH THE QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE WORKSHOPS, WILL BE PRESENTED.	***	
	GRRRU	ERNOUL,LISA								TOURIS DU VALAT,FRANCE								ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT OF COASTAL AREAS USING THE OPEN STANDARDS APPROACH	2011	MEDCOAST			7							1	SIN CORRESPONDIG	ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT WAS FIRST DEFINED BY HOLLING (1978) AS A STRUCTURED, ITERATIVE PROCESS OF OPTIMAL DECISION MAKING IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY, WITH AN AIM AT REDUCING UNCERTAINTY OVER TIME VIA SYSTEM MONITORING. ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT IS A TOOL WHICH SHOULD BE USED NOT ONLY TO CHANGE A SYSTEM, BUT ALSO TO LEARN ABOUT THE SYSTEM. IT RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR MANAGEMENT DECISIONS TO EXAMINE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES IN AN INTEGRATED WAY; TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PRESENCE OF MANY DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT ISSUES AND THE UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES. THIS PARADIGM HAS BECOME FUNDAMENTAL TO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT OVER THE LAST 4 DECADES. MANY ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE INCORPORATED ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT SCHEMES INTO THEIR PROGRAMS, BUT THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS HAS BEEN LIMITED DUE TO A LACK OF STANDARD LEXICON FOR BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT. THIS HAS LIMITED THE POSSIBILITY FOR PRACTITIONERS TO LEARN FROM OTHER EXPERIENCES, CAUSING A REPETITION OF TRIALS AND ERRORS. OPEN STANDARDS FOR THE PRACTICE OF CONSERVATION (OS) WERE DEVELOPED AS RESPONSE TO THIS PROBLEM, WITH THE COLLABORATION OF MANY ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TOGETHER TO CREATE A COMMON VOCABULARY IN ORDER TO SHARE EXPERIENCES AND ADAPT METHODOLOGIES. MORE AND MORE ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS EUROPE ARE STARTING TO USE OS. IN 2007, THE FIRST ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT TRAINING USING THE OS WAS ORGANIZED IN EUROPE. SINCE THEN A NETWORK OF AREAS AND PEOPLE PRACTICING THE OS EMERGED AND IN JANUARY 2011 TRAINED PROFESSIONALS FROM VARIOUS EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED THE EUROPEAN CONSERVATION COACHES NETWORK (CCNET EUROPE), WITH A SPECIAL MEDITERRANEAN SECTION. MANY SITES ARE NOW PRACTICING ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT USING THE OS, INCLUDING THE AXIOS DELTA (GREECE), MUNTANYA DALINYA (CATALUNYA, SPAIN), THE TOUR DU VALAT (CAMARGUE, FRANCE) AND THE SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS OF MEDITERRANEAN IMPORTANCE (SPAMI) IN ITALY. EACH PROJECT IS AT A DIFFERENT PHASE OF IMPLEMENTATION FROM MANAGEMENT PLAN DEVELOPMENT TO IMPLEMENTATION. WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE OS ARE COMPATIBLE AND COMPLEMENTARY TO NATURA 2000 SITES. THE ADVANTAGES THAT HAVE BEEN SEEN IN THE SITES INCLUDE: SUCH AS PROMOTING PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE CAUSE EFFECT RELATIONSHIPS, DESIGNS STRATEGIES FOCUSING ON THE ABATEMENT OF PRIORITIZED THREATS, AND PRIORITIZES STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS. THE OS MANAGEMENT PLANS ARE ANCHORED IN BIOLOGICAL TARGETS AND THESE TARGETS CAN ALLOW NATURA 2000 SITES TO MOVE BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HABITATS OR SPECIES, AND INCLUDE ECOLOGICAL PROCESS AND HABITAT FRAGMENTATION AS WELL. DESPITE THESE POSITIVE ASPECTS, WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL OBSTACLES IN OUR APPLICATION OF THE OS INCLUDING THE NEED FOR MORE QUALIFIED FACILITATORS/COACHES, THE LACK OF TRAINING MATERIALS AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE IN LOCAL LANGUAGES AND THE IMPORTANT TIME/HUMAN RESOURCE NEEDS IMPLICATED DURING THE PROCESS. THESE DIFFICULTIES ARE CURRENTLY BEING ADDRESSED BY THE CCNET EUROPE THROUGH THE TRAINING OF COACHES AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A WEBSITE TO SHARE EXPERIENCES AND LEARN FROM OTHERS ACROSS EUROPE.	***

RECENTLY, EUROPEAN DIRECTIVES AND RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE SUPPORTED THE NECESSITY AND ADEQUACY OF TAKING A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO ACHIEVE INTEGRATION. IN PARTICULAR THE ROLE OF THE DATA (SPATIAL DATA AND DATABASES) IN THE PROCESS OF COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT HAS EMERGED AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF INTEGRATED APPROACHES TO INSTITUTIONAL AND POLICY RESPONSE. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SPATIAL INFORMATION IN EUROPE (INSPIRE) DIRECTIVE, WHICH PROVIDES AN ADEQUATE FRAMEWORK FOR RESPONDING TO AND UTILIZING THE POTENTIAL EXCHANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL DATASETS THAT IS COLLECTED AND CREATED BY PUBLIC AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION, TOGETHER WITH MANY ENVIRONMENTAL DIRECTIVES, FACILITATES THE ASSEMBLY OF LARGE MARINE DATASETS COLLECTED BY PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND ENHANCES THE RE USE OF DATA. THIS POLICY FRAMEWORK HAS UNDERLINED THE NECESSITY FOR INCORPORATING NEW APPROACHES IN SPATIAL DATA ANALYSIS, INTEGRATED AND SHARED THROUGH COMMON SPATIAL DATA INFRASTRUCTURES (SDI) FOR ICZM; THE PROTOCOL ON ICZM IN THE MEDITERRANEAN (UNEP, 2008), NEEDS OF COMMON APPROACHES DRAWN THROUGH A SET OF INDICATORS TO MEASURE THE APPLICABILITY OF THE PROTOCOL AND MANAGEMENT PROCESSES. ACCORDING TO THIS PURPOSE, THE PEGASO PROJECT IS CREATING AN SDI FOR THE MEDITERRANEAN AND BLACK SEA BASINS, INCLUDING THE MOST IMPORTANT EFFORTS MADE BY THE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND AGENCIES IN CREATING SPATIAL DATASETS. THIS PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK TO CREATE AND DEVELOP INDICATORS AND OTHER TOOLS TO ACHIEVE ICZM FOR THESE TWO BASINS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO CONSTRUCT A SET OF GEONODES IN EACH PARTNER INSTITUTION WHICH FACILITATE PARTNERS TO DISPLAY AND SHARE THEIR DATA AND EXPERIENCE IN ICZM TO THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY THROUGH THE PEGASO SDI, AND THEREFORE ENHANCE SPATIAL DATA AVAILABILITY IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS FOR COASTAL MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION. THE DIVERSITY OF NEEDS IN COASTAL AND MARINE SPATIAL DATA TO IMPLEMENT ICZM STRATEGIES DUE BOTH TO THE VARIETY OF COASTAL ISSUES AND THE DIVERSITY OF COASTAL REGIONS, THE HARMONISATION OF DATASETS AND THE NECESSITY FOR TRAINING WITHIN THE PEGASO CONSORTIUM TO ASSURE A WELL DEVELOPED SDI ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FACED ON THIS WORK. RESULTS THUS FAR INDICATES THAT: (I) THE CAPACITY FOR DATA PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT IS VARIED, (II) GEONODE IMPLEMENTATION WILL IMPROVE CAPACITY OF INSTITUTIONS TO RESPOND TO ICZM CHALLENGES AND (III) A NEW PARADIGM IN INTEROPERABILITY FOR SPATIAL DATA WILL TRANSFORM COASTAL GOVERNANCE THROUGH SDIS INTERACTIVE VIEWER AS STAKEHOLDERS AND POLICY MAKERS AND MANAGERS INTERACT ON NEW FURTHER INFORMED CAPACITIES.	***

UNTIL RECENTLY, THE CARTOGRAPHIC SUPPORT USED IN DANUBE DELTA WAS THE ONE MADE IN 1965, WITH A REDUCED PRECISION AND NOT ACCURATE NOW BECAUSE OF THE GEOMORPHOLOGIC CHANGES. THE DTM CAN BE MADE USING THE MOST ADVANCED METHOD, REMOTE SENSING (LIDAR LIGHT DETECTION AND RANGING,) WHICH LEADS TO A HIGH PRECISION BOTH ON X, Y (1 M) AND THE Z (0.2 M). THE ADVANTAGES OF DIGITAL MAPPING SUPPORT SO PROVIDED ARE: FASTER AND CHEAPER PREPARATION OF MAPS; DESIGNING MAPS FOR USERS IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF INTEREST; THE POSSIBILITY TO OBTAIN MAPS IN CRISIS; FACILITATE DATA ANALYSIS AIMED AT INTERACTION BETWEEN STATISTICS AND MAPPING; INCREASE EFFICIENCY BY USING DIGITAL MAPS VERSUS PRINTED MAPS; THE POSSIBILITY OF ACHIEVING THREE DIMENSIONAL AND STEREOSCOPIC REPRESENTATIONS; AUTOMATION THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF MAPPING. GENERAL SUPPORT OF HIGH RESOLUTION DIGITAL MAP CONSISTS OF FOUR COMPONENTS: DIGITAL TERRAIN MODEL (DTM), DIGITAL ELEVATION MODEL (DEM) ELEVATION CLASSES (EC), ORTHOPHOTOMAPS (OFP).

INTRODUCTION OF CULTURAL LANDSCAPE CONSERVATION AS A NEW TOPIC INTO INTERNATIONAL MEDIUMS HAS BECOME IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY AFTER 1980S AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN THE AWARENESS OF SUSTAINABILITY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. CULTURAL LANDSCAPE AREAS ARE SIGNIFICANT POTENTIALS IN UTILIZATION OF TRADITIONAL LIFESTYLES AND LOCAL INFORMATION SHOWING SUSTAINABLE USE AND LIVING IN HARMONY WITH NATURE TO ACHIEVE ICZM PRINCIPLES AND REQUIRED APPROPRIATE GOVERNANCE MODELS. THUS, TRADITIONAL CULTURAL LANDSCAPES ARE SUPPORTED AS THE SOURCE FOR SUSTAINABLE LAND USE TO ACHIEVE BALANCE BETWEEN NATURE AND HUMAN; AS WELL AS MAINTAINING BIODIVERSITY. BEING A SIGNIFICANT MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRY WITH ITS RICH AND DIVERSE COASTAL HERITAGE VALUES, TURKEY DESERVES SPECIAL ATTENTION REGARDING COASTAL CULTURAL LANDSCAPE AREAS. PROBLEMS AROUSED FROM LACK OF APPROPRIATE ICZM POLICIES, FRAGMENTATION OF EXISTING LEGISLATIVE TOOLS AND LACK OF DESIGNATION STATUS RELATED TO CULTURAL/RURAL LANDSCAPE AREAS CAUSING SEVERE THREATS ON THESE HAS BEEN THE BASIS FOR DISCUSSIONS OF THIS PAPER. FOR THIS PURPOSE THIS PAPER AIMS TO FOCUS ON ACHIEVING APPROPRIATE INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT POLICIES FOR COASTAL CULTURAL LANDSCAPE VALUES OF TURKEY WITHIN THE GOALS AND STRATEGIES OF ICZM PRINCIPLES. FIRST SECTION OF THE PAPER INCLUDES REVIEW ON GENERATION OF IMPORTANT KEY CONCEPTS AND MILESTONES REGARDING CULTURAL LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT WITH SPECIFIC EMPHASIS ON COASTAL AREAS AND ICZM POLICIES THAT ARE PUT FORTH BY INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS.

THE AIM OF THIS SUBCOMPONENT IS TO REVERSE THE TRENDS IN OVER EXTRACTION AND DEGRADATION IN THE QUALITY OF COASTAL AQUIFERS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN COASTAL ZONE THROUGH POLICY INTERACTIONS FOR PROVIDING APPROPRIATE CAPACITY AND TECHNOLOGY FOR GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT. THE ACTIVITIES FOCUS ON ASSESSING THE RISKS TO COASTAL AQUIFERS AND ASSOCIATED UNCERTAINTIES, THE PREPARATION OF A REGIONAL ACTION PLAN, DEMONSTRATIONS IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER SUB COMPONENTS (ICZM, IWRM) AND THE DRAFTING OF LEGISLATIVE, POLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS CONTRIBUTING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BARCELONA CONVENTION AND THE RELATED PROTOCOLS. THIS PAPER ADDRESS THE RESEARCH WORK CARRIED OUT IN TWO CASE STUDIES OF THIS SUB COMPONENT THAT HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE ITALIAN MINISTRY FOR ENVIRONMENT, LAND AND SEA AS A CONTRIBUTION TO THE MEDPARTNERSHIP. THE FIRST CASE STUDY ADDRESSES THE VULNERABILITY OF THE COASTAL AQUIFER OF GHAR EL METH IN THE NORTH OF TUNISIA. IN THE LARGEST PART OF THE AREA THERE IS MORE THAN ONE AQUIFER. ALL AQUIFERS ARE EXPLOITED BY PEOPLE THROUGH WELLS AND THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE HAND DUG AND USED FOR AGRICULTURE PURPOSES. IN MORE THAN ONE POINT, THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FRESH WATER OF THE AQUIFERS AND THE SALT WATER OF THE LAGOON OR OF THE SEA. THE AQUIFERS IN THIS AREA PRESENT TWO TYPES OF HYDROGEOLOGICAL VULNERABILITY: THE FIRST IS DUE TO THE VERTICAL VULNERABILITY OF THE AQUIFER RESULTING FROM A POLLUTANT COMING FROM THE SURFACE AND THE SECOND IS DUE TO THE VULNERABILITY RESULTING FROM SALT WATER INTRUSION. THIS STUDY WILL PRESENT THE METHODOLOGY USED FOR THE EVALUATION OF THE AQUIFERS VULNERABILITY AND THE NEXT STEPS FOR THE CREATION OF A HYDROGEOLOGICAL MODEL AND A VULNERABILITY MAP. THE SECOND CASE STUDY ADDRESSES THE HYDROGEOCHEMICAL STUDY OF THE BOU AREG COASTAL PLAIN IN THE NORTH OF MOROCCO. THE ALLUVIAL COASTAL AQUIFER IS DRAINED BY A LARGE NUMBER OF WELLS DRILLED FOR CIVIL, INDUSTRIAL, AGRICULTURAL AND DOMESTIC PURPOSES. THEREFORE, THE MAIN IMPACTS ON THE AQUIFER ARE ASSOCIATED ON THE ONE HAND TO ABSTRACTION RATES EXCEEDING NATURAL REPLENISHMENT RATES, AND POSSIBLY LEADING TO OVEREXPLOITATION PROBLEMS, AND ON THE OTHER TO DIFFUSE AND POINT SOURCES OF POLLUTION ASSOCIATED TO HUMAN ACTIVITIES CAUSING THE DEGRADATION OF THE NATURAL GROUNDWATER QUALITY. IN ORDER TO EVALUATE AND QUANTIFY THOSE PROCESSES, THE INVESTIGATION ON THE BOU AREG COASTAL AQUIFER IS FOCUSED ON THE APPLICATION OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY AND ISOTOPIC (DELTA H 2, DELTA O 18, DELTA C 13, DELTA N 15(NO3), DELTA O 18(NO3)) TRACERS AIMED TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN SOURCES OF GROUNDWATER POLLUTION AND SALINIZATION.	***

ACCORDING, MANY OF THE PROBLEMS FACING SURFACE AND GROUND ENVIRONMENTS CAN ONLY BE SOLVED THROUGH APPROPRIATE SCIENTIFIC METHODOLOGIES BASED ON AN ECOSYSTEM APPROACH THAT CONSIDER MULTIPLE NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS AND RECEPTORS. DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR COASTAL CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT ASSESSMENT (DESYCO) IS A GIS BASED TOOL FOR THE ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON COASTAL AREAS AND RELATED ENVIRONMENTS AT THE REGIONAL SCALE. IT ADOPTS AN ECOSYSTEM APPROACH AND IMPLEMENTS A REGIONAL RISK ASSESSMENT (RRA) METHODOLOGY, BASED ON MULTI CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS (MCDA), IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE AREAS AND TARGETS AT RISK IN THE CONSIDERED REGION. THE RRA METHODOLOGY INTEGRATES CLIMATE CHANGE HAZARDS ANALYSIS, BASED ON THE ELABORATION OF OUTPUT FROM CLIMATE, HYDRODYNAMIC, HYDROLOGICAL, HYDROGEOLOGICAL AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL MODELS, WITH VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO ECONOMIC FEATURES OF THE TERRITORY. DESYCO AND THE RRA GIS BASED OUTPUTS ALLOW THE PRIORITIZATION OF INTERVENTION OPTIONS THROUGH THE VISUALIZATION OF IMPACTED AREAS AND VULNERABLE RECEPTORS. DESYCO HAS BEEN TESTED IN FOUR DIFFERENT CASE STUDIES: THE ESINO RIVER BASIN AND GROUNDWATER (MARCHE REGION, ITALY) WITHIN THE SALT PROJECT, THE UPPER PLAIN OF THE VENETO AND FRIULI VENEZIA GIULIA REGIONS (ITALY) WITHIN THE TRUST PROJECT, THE COASTAL AREAS OF THE NORTHERN ADRIATIC SEA (ITALY) WITHIN THE PEGASO PROJECTS, AND THE GULF OF GABES (TUNISIA) WITHIN THE CANTICO PROJECT.

AS A RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE THE PRIMARY MECHANISM ON A GEOPOLITICAL SCALE HAS BEEN ONE OF MITIGATION, AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE THE ANTHROPOGENIC CAUSES AT ITS ROOT. HOWEVER, PERCEIVED LIMITATIONS OF THIS APPROACH LED PARTIES TO THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE (UNFCC) TO AGREE IN BALI, 2007 THAT THE ALTERNATIVE APPROACH OF ADAPTATION SHOULD PLAY A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER ROLE IN THE FUTURE GLOBAL RESPONSE, AND THIS IS NOW EMBEDDED AS ONE OF THE POST 2012 PILLARS. THERE IS EVIDENCE OF ADAPTATION ALREADY TAKING PLACE BUT THIS IS CURRENTLY PIECEMEAL IN NATURE, WITH RESEARCH SHOWING DISTINCT CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS TO ITS INTRODUCTION. NEVERTHELESS, ENHANCED VULNERABILITY FACING COASTAL COMMUNITIES REQUIRES NOVEL SOLUTIONS TO ENABLE ITS IMPLEMENTATION, THUS ALLOWING FOR A MORE STRATEGIC APPROACH TO ENSURE THAT TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE MEASURES ARE TAKEN, AND TO ENSURE COHERENCE ACROSS DIFFERENT SECTORS AND LEVELS OF GOVERNANCE. THE RESEARCH PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER IS CONCERNED WITH EXPLORING THE CAPACITY OF COASTAL AREAS TO ADAPT TO CHANGE IN TERMS OF POLICY, SPATIAL PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS, AND IS GEOGRAPHICALLY FOCUSSED ON THE SOLENT. THIS ESTUARINE COMPLEX IS AN AREA OF COAST LIKELY TO BE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO COASTAL CHANGE SINCE IT IS DENSELY POPULATED, LOW LYING AND HIGHLY CONTESTED BY A RANGE OF COMPETING INTERESTS. IT IS ALSO LIKELY TO INCLUDE SPECIFIC AREAS DEFINED AS COASTAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT AREAS (CCMAS) THAT WILL NOT BE PROTECTED BY ANY NEW MEASURES; HENCE REQUIRING COMMUNITIES TO ADAPT. THE PAPER WILL OUTLINE AN EU INTERREG IVA 2 SEAS FUNDED PROJECT ENTITLED COASTAL COMMUNITIES 2150 AND BEYOND (CC2150), AND IN PARTICULAR ITS APPLICATION IN THE SOLENT. ON THE BASIS OF VULNERABILITY AND COASTAL RISK, THIS PROJECT IS AIMED AT INFORMING COMMUNITIES OF PREDICTED CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT BE EMPOWERED TO FIND PROACTIVE RESPONSES TO THE PROBLEM OF COASTAL CHANGE. CENTRAL TO THIS IS THE NEED TO COMMUNICATE SCIENCE AND BUILD CAPACITY WITHIN COASTAL AREAS, SO AS TO ENABLE EFFECTIVE PLANNING, THE CONCLUSIONS OF WHICH ARE HORIZONTALLY TRANSFERRABLE TO OTHER VULNERABLE AREAS OF THE UK COAST AND BEYOND.	***

AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY HAS SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE NATIONAL ECONOMY AND HAS COMBATED UNEMPLOYMENT ESPECIALLY IN REMOTE AREAS. DURING THE LAST DECADE, MARINE AQUACULTURE HAS PROVEN TO BE ONE OF THE FASTEST DEVELOPING ACTIVITIES OF THE GREEK PRIMARY SECTOR (HOLDING THE FIRST POSITION AMONGST THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN INTENSIVE MARINE AQUACULTURE PRODUCTION) BY UTILIZING THE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS OF THE HELLENIC SEAS AS WELL AS BY THE STRUCTURAL POLICIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION OFFERING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. NEVERTHELESS MARINE AQUACULTURE PRODUCTION HAS DISPLAYED SIGNS OF STABILITY DURING RECENT YEARS MAINLY DUE TO LACK OF AVAILABILITY OF SUITABLE INSTALLATION AREAS IN THE COASTAL ZONE, SECONDARY DUE TO CAPACITY ADJUSTMENTS OWING TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER ISSUES AND THIRDLY DUE TO DIFFICULTY OF INCREASING PRIMARY MATERIAL PRODUCTION IN ORDER TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY (A MAJOR EXAMPLE IS SMALL PELAGIC FISH USED FOR FISHMEAL PRODUCTION, A MAJOR CONSTITUENT OF FISH FEED FOR INTENSIVE AQUACULTURE). E.U. STRATEGY FOR SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE WAS VALIDATED BY THE COMMON FISHERIES POLICY (CFP) IN 2002 AIMING IN AQUACULTURE DEVELOPMENT. CFP APPLIED A PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH TAKING MEASURES AIMING TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE THE LIVING AQUATIC RESOURCES THROUGH SUSTAINABLE EXPLOITATION. CFP COVERS ACTIVITIES OF PRESERVATION, MANAGEMENT AND EXPLOITATION OF LIVING AQUATIC RESOURCES, AQUACULTURE, MANUFACTURE AND SELLING OF FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE PRODUCTS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT WHILE BALANCING THE ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL EXTENSIONS. SINCE ADOPTING THE CFP THEN THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENT IN ENSURING ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, SAFETY AND QUALITY OF THE AQUACULTURE PRODUCTS IN THE E.U. AT PRESENT THERE ARE NO INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN QUANTITATIVE AIMS FOR AQUACULTURE DEVELOPMENT. THE MAIN AIMS OF AQUACULTURE HAVE BEEN THE REPLENISHMENT OF THE NEGATIVE BALANCE THAT THE FISHING INDUSTRY CREATES DUE TO EXCESSIVE DEMAND AND THE SUPPORT OF THE SOCIOECONOMIC NETWORK IN REMOTE IMPOVERISHED AREAS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE WAYS OTHER THAN FISHING OF MARINE ECOSYSTEM EXPLOITATION. IN ORDER TO FURTHER DEVELOP THE AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY IN GREECE A NUMBER OF MEASURES NEED TO BE ESTABLISHED.

ELECTROCHEMICAL GENERATION OF ACTIVE CHLORINE ON BOARD WOULD ELIMINATE SUCH UNFAVORABLE FEATURES OF CHLORINE DISINFECTION. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SEAWATER HAVE A DIRECT EFFECT ON THE CAPABILITY OF AN ELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTEM TO FUNCTION SUCCESSFULLY. SEAWATER CONTAINS A WIDE RANGE OF SALTS AT VARIOUS CONCENTRATIONS AND COMBINATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, COASTAL SEAWATER MAY ALSO CONTAIN AMMONIA BESIDE DOMESTIC BASED ORGANIC POLLUTANTS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF AMMONIA WHICH WILL GO UNDER ELECTROCHEMICAL PROCESS DURING DISINFECTANT PRODUCTION. IT IS FIGURED OUT THAT AMMONIA LEADS TO LESS TOTAL AND FREE AVAILABLE CHLORINE CONCENTRATIONS IN ELECTROCHEMICALLY GENERATED DISINFECTANT.

AS A RESULT, FLOOD RISK ASSESSMENTS HAVE BECOME AN URGENT CHALLENGE REQUIRING A RANGE OF RAPID AND EFFECTIVE TOOLS AND APPROACHES. THE SUSTAINABLE FLOOD RETENTION BASIN (SFRB) CONCEPT HAS EVOLVED TO PROVIDE A RAPID ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUE FOR IMPOUNDMENTS, WHICH HAVE A PRE DEFINED OR POTENTIAL ROLE IN FLOOD DEFENSE AND DIFFUSE POLLUTION CONTROL. A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE SFRB SURVEY METHOD DEVELOPED BY THE CO AUTHOR SCHOLZ IN 2006 RECOMMENDS GATHERING OF OVER 40 VARIABLES TO CHARACTERIZE AN SERB. COLLECTING ALL THESE VARIABLES IS RELATIVELY TIME CONSUMING AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, THESE VARIABLES ARE OFTEN CORRELATED WITH EACH OTHER. THEREFORE, THE OBJECTIVE IS TO EXPLORE THE CORRELATION AMONG THESE VARIABLES AND FIND THE MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLES TO REPRESENT AN SFRB. THREE FEATURE SELECTION TECHNIQUES (INFORMATION GAIN, MUTUAL INFORMATION AND RELIEF) WERE APPLIED ON THE SFRB DATA SET TO IDENTIFY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE VARIABLES IN TERMS OF CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY. FOUR BENCHMARK CLASSIFIERS (SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, K NEAREST NEIGHBOURS, C4.5 DECISION TREE AND NAIVE BAYES) WERE SUBSEQUENTLY USED TO VERIFY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CLASSIFICATION WITH THE SELECTED VARIABLES AND AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFY THE OPTIMAL NUMBER OF VARIABLES. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS INDICATE THAT OUR PROPOSED APPROACH PROVIDES A SIMPLE, RAPID AND EFFECTIVE FRAMEWORK FOR VARIABLE SELECTION AND SFRB CLASSIFICATION. ONLY NINE IMPORTANT VARIABLES ARE SUFFICIENT TO ACCURATELY CLASSIFY SFRB. FINALLY, SIX TYPICAL CASES WERE STUDIED TO VERIFY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE IDENTIFIED NINE VARIABLES ON DIFFERENT SFRB TYPES. THE FINDINGS PROVIDE A RAPID SCIENTIFIC TOOL FOR SFRB ASSESSMENT IN PRACTICE. MOREOVER, THE GENERIC VALUE OF THIS TOOL ALLOWS ALSO FOR ITS WIDE APPLICATION IN OTHER AREAS. (C) 2010 ELSEVIER LTD.

SO CONSERVATION OF SURFACE WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY ARE MORE IMPORTANT FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT THAN GREEN HOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS PER SE. IN THIS PAPER, TWO URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO CONSERVE FRESH WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY ARE CONSIDERED: (1) SOURCE SEPARATION OF URINE FOR IMPROVED WATER QUALITY AND (2) SALINE (E. G. SEA) WATER TOILET FLUSHING FOR REDUCED FRESH WATER CONSUMPTION IN COASTAL AND MINING CITIES. THE FORMER HOLDS PROMISE FOR SIMPLER AND SHORTER SLUDGE AGE ACTIVATED SLUDGE WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS (NO NITRIFICATION AND DENITRIFICATION), NUTRIENT (MG, K, P) RECOVERY AND IMPROVED EFFLUENT QUALITY (REDUCED ENDOCRINE DISRUPTOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL OESTROGEN CONCENTRATIONS) AND THE LATTER FOR SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED FRESH WATER CONSUMPTION, SLUDGE PRODUCTION AND OXYGEN DEMAND (THROUGH USING ANAEROBIC BIOPROCESSES) AND HENCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION. COMBINING SOURCE SEPARATION OF URINE AND SALINE WATER TOILET FLUSHING CAN REDUCE SEWER CROWN CORROSION AND REDUCE EFFLUENT P CONCENTRATIONS. TO REALIZE THE ADVANTAGES OF THESE TWO APPROACHES WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT CHANGES IN THAT BOTH NEED DUAL (FRESH AND SALINE) WATER DISTRIBUTION AND (YELLOW AND GREY/BROWN) WASTEWATER COLLECTION SYSTEMS. WHILE CONSIDERABLE WORK IS STILL REQUIRED TO EVALUATE THESE NEW APPROACHES AND QUANTIFY THEIR ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES, IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE INVESTMENT FOR DUAL WATER DISTRIBUTION AND WASTEWATER COLLECTION SYSTEMS MAY BE WORTH MAKING TO UNLOCK THEIR BENEFITS FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE URBAN DEVELOPMENT.	***

IN KARST ENVIRONMENTS, SUCH AS THE YUCATAN PENINSULA (SE MEXICO), THE BALANCE BETWEEN THESE TWO INFLUENCES ON SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. THIS STUDY FOCUSED ON NEAR SHORE WATERS WITHIN 200 M OFFSHORE ALONG THE YUCATAN COAST. THE TROPHIC STATUS AND HYDROCHEMICAL ZONES OF THE STUDY AREA WERE DETERMINED AS A FUNCTION OF PHYSICAL AND NUTRIENT DATA COLLECTED FROM 2005 TO 2006. THE MAIN TERRESTRIAL INFLUENCE WAS GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE, WHILE THE MOST IMPORTANT MARINE INFLUENCE WAS RELATED TO SEASONAL CHANGES IN WATER TURBULENCE. SPATIAL DIFFERENCES ( P < 0.05) WERE OBSERVED AMONG SALINITY, LIGHT EXTINCTION COEFFICIENT (K), NO3 , NH4+, AND CHL A. SEASONAL DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED FOR ALL VARIABLES EXCEPT FOR K. DURING THE DRY SEASON, TERRESTRIAL INFLUENCES ARE THE DOMINANT FACTOR ON NEAR SHORE HYDROCHEMISTRY. THE REGION AROUND DZILAM EXHIBITED THE MAXIMUM INFLUENCE OF GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE ESTIMATED BY SALINITY DISSOLUTION (6). DURING THE RAINY AND NORTES SEASONS, THERE IS A BALANCE BETWEEN OCEANIC AND TERRESTRIAL INFLUENCES. THE TROPHIC STATUS MEASURED USING THE TRIX INDEX, INDICATED THAT NEAR SHORE WATERS WERE MAINLY OLIGOMESOTROPHIC; WITH A MESO EUTROPHIC STATUS IN AREAS WITH DOCUMENTED ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS. FOUR HYDROLOGICAL ZONES WERE IDENTIFIED BY A CANONICAL VARIATE ANALYSIS (CVA) USING SALINITY, NO2 , K AND NH4+ AS THE MAIN DISCRIMINATING VARIABLES. ZONES I AND II SHOWED ALMOST PRISTINE CONDITIONS, WITH WELL BALANCED TERRESTRIAL OCEANIC INFLUENCES. IN ZONE III, TERRESTRIAL INFLUENCES SUCH AS GROUNDWATER DISCHARGES AND INLAND POLLUTION SUGGESTING HUMAN IMPACTS WERE DOMINANT RESPECT TO THE EFFECTS OF OCEANIC INFLUENCES LIKE UPWELLING AND SEDIMENT RESUSPENSION CAUSED BY WINDS AND OCEANIC CURRENTS. ZONE IV RECEIVED ENHANCED GROUNDWATER AND ASSOCIATED NUTRIENTS. ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES HAVE LED TO ECOSYSTEM DEGRADATION BUT THE SPEED AT WHICH THIS OCCURS DEPENDS ON LOCAL AND REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY HAS DEFINED THOSE CHARACTERISTICS SO AS TO ENACT BETTER MANAGEMENT POLICIES. (C) 2010 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

TWO DIFFERENT SURROGATE MODELS BASED ON GENETIC PROGRAMMING (GP) AND MODULAR NEURAL NETWORK (MNN) ARE DEVELOPED AND LINKED TO A MULTI OBJECTIVE GENETIC ALGORITHM (MOGA) TO DERIVE THE OPTIMAL PUMPING STRATEGIES FOR COASTAL AQUIFER MANAGEMENT, CONSIDERING TWO OBJECTIVES. TRAINED AND TESTED SURROGATE MODELS ARE USED TO PREDICT THE SALINITY CONCENTRATIONS AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS RESULTING DUE TO GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION. A TWO STAGE TRAINING STRATEGY IS IMPLEMENTED FOR TRAINING THE SURROGATE MODELS. SURROGATE MODELS ARE INITIALLY TRAINED WITH INPUT PATTERNS SELECTED UNIFORMLY FROM THE ENTIRE SEARCH SPACE AND OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES BASED ON THE MODEL PREDICTIONS ARE DERIVED FROM THE MANAGEMENT MODEL. A SEARCH SPACE ADAPTATION AND MODEL RETRAINING IS PERFORMED BY IDENTIFYING A MODIFIED SEARCH SPACE NEAR THE INITIAL OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS BASED ON THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE VARIABLES IN SALINITY PREDICTION. RETRAINING OF THE SURROGATE MODELS IS PERFORMED USING INPUT OUTPUT SAMPLES GENERATED IN THE MODIFIED SEARCH SPACE. PERFORMANCE OF THE METHODOLOGIES USING GP AND MNN BASED SURROGATE MODELS ARE COMPARED FOR AN ILLUSTRATIVE STUDY AREA. THE CAPABILITY OF GP TO IDENTIFY THE IMPACT OF INPUT VARIABLES AND THE RESULTING PARSIMONY OF THE INPUT VARIABLES HELPS IN DEVELOPING EFFICIENT SURROGATE MODELS. THE DEVELOPED GP MODELS HAVE LESSER UNCERTAINTY COMPARED TO MNN MODELS AS THE NUMBER OF PARAMETERS USED IN GP IS MUCH LESSER THAN THAT IN MNN MODELS. ALSO GP BASED MODEL WAS FOUND TO BE BETTER SUITED FOR OPTIMIZATION USING ADAPTIVE SEARCH SPACE. (C) 2010 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

ONE OF THE PROJECTS THAT THE USACE AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF BOATING AND WATERWAYS COOPERATIVELY FUNDS IS THE COASTAL DATA INFORMATION PROGRAM (CDIP). THE CDIP IS BASED AT THE SCRIPPS INSTITUTION OF OCEANOGRAPHY WITH ITS MAIN FOCUS ON HIGH RESOLUTION DIRECTIONAL WAVE MEASUREMENTS. THE CDIP SERVES AS ONE OF THE USACES CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARD IOOS, THUS PROMOTING SUSTAINED AND QUALITY WAVE MEASUREMENTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES EXAMPLES OF HOW RELIABLE, ACCURATE WAVE DATA SERVE THE MARITIME COMMUNITY AND COASTAL MANAGERS. SEVERAL OF THE CDIP BUOYS ARE MOORED AT THE ENTRANCES TO PORTS AND HARBORS OR CLOSE TO THE NEARSHORE WHERE WAVES IMPACT THE COASTAL ZONE. AS EVIDENT, EACH PORT OR HARBOR HAS UNIQUE CONDITIONS AND THEREFORE ITS OWN SET OF CHALLENGES. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES ARE DEMONSTRATED AS TO HOW CDIP AND IOOS HAVE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS, BY CONTRIBUTING TO THE SAFETY OR ECONOMICS OF MARINE OPERATIONS AND COASTAL MANAGEMENT. THE REAL TIME DATA ARE AVAILABLE ON THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COASTAL OBSERVING SYSTEM (HTTP://SCCOOS.ORG) AND THE CORRESPONDING REGIONAL ASSOCIATIONS WEBSITES.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RAINFALL INTENSITY, AIR TEMPERATURE AND WIND SPEED OBTAINED FROM MESOSCALE NUMERICAL WEATHER MODELLING IS EXAMINED RELATIVE TO LANDSLIDE INCIDENCE WITHIN STEEP TERRAIN. A CRITICAL ONSET OF RAINFALL INTENSITY BETWEEN 80 AND 100 MM IN 24 H THAT RESULTS IN A RAPID INCREASE IN LANDSLIDES WITH INCREASING PRECIPITATION IS DEMONSTRATED. THE ARGUMENT IS PRESENTED THAT THIS RESULT IS MORE USEFUL FOR LANDSLIDE MANAGEMENT DECISIONS THAN A MINIMUM THRESHOLD. THE COMPONENT OF WIND DRIVEN RAIN WAS CALCULATED, AND RESULTS INDICATED THAT WIND CAUSED INCREASED CONCENTRATIONS OF RAINFALL ASSOCIATED WITH THE OCCURRENCE OF LANDSLIDES. APPROXIMATELY HALF THE LANDSLIDES STUDIED WERE NOT RELATED TO RAINFALL ALONE, BUT TO RAIN ON SNOW, AND WE ARGUE THAT WIND PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE. THIS OFTEN NEGLECTED COMPONENT OF HYDROLOGICAL ANALYSIS REMAINS A MAJOR CHALLENGE AS THE ROLE OF SNOW TRANSITION ZONES AND A WARMING CLIMATE IN COASTAL MOUNTAIN WATERSHEDS IS CONSIDERED.	***

HOWEVER, THE RAZOR CLAM POPULATION IS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASING SO THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYZE THE RAZOR CLAM FISHERY AND DEVELOP A MANAGEMENT PLAN ENGAGING THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS IN COLLECTIVE DISCUSSIONS. A PARTICIPATORY MODELLING APPROACH WAS USED, INCLUDING (A) AGENT BASED MODELLING (ABM) AND (B) ROLE PLAYING GAMES (RPG). FIRST, AN INDIVIDUAL STATE DISTRIBUTION MODEL OF THE RAZOR CLAM POPULATION WAS DESIGNED AND CALIBRATED TO SYNTHESISE KNOWLEDGE. TWO RPG SESSIONS SUPPORTED BY THIS BIOLOGICAL MODEL WERE ORGANISED TO INITIATE COLLECTIVE LEARNING AND PROMOTE DISCUSSION AMONG STAKEHOLDERS. AFTER PLAYING WITH THE BASELINE SCENARIO SHOWING THE ACTUAL HARVESTING SITUATION, DISCUSSIONS LED TO THE DEFINITION OF ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS FOR CLAM MANAGEMENT SUCH AS ESTABLISHMENT AND ROTATION OF ZONES CLOSED FOR HARVESTING, AND QUOTA SYSTEMS. THESE SCENARIOS DEVELOPED DURING THE RPG SESSIONS WERE MORE DEEPLY INVESTIGATED WITH AN AGENT BASED MODEL THAT INCLUDED FISHERMEN AGENTS AND THE INDIVIDUAL STATE DISTRIBUTION MODEL OF THE RAZOR CLAM POPULATION. SIMULATIONS OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS (RESERVE, QUOTA AND COMBINATION OF RESERVE AND QUOTA) WERE PRODUCED TO ENABLE BETTER INFORMED DISCUSSION BETWEEN DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS. STAKEHOLDERS HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MANAGEMENT THROUGH ROTATING RESERVES IS NOT EFFICIENT IF THE DURATION OF RESERVES IS TOO SHORT. THEY HAVE REALISED THAT THE EFFICIENCY OF RESERVES IS HARD TO ASSESS WITHOUT BETTER DATA ON CLAM RECRUITMENT. THEY HAVE ALSO EXPLORED ANOTHER MANAGEMENT OPTION WHICH IS THE QUOTA SYSTEM. IN THE FINAL STAGE, THE LOCAL PARTICIPATORY PROCESS WAS ENDORSED BY THE INCUMBENT REGIONAL POLICY MAKING ACTOR. UNFORTUNATELY, BECAUSE OF RAPID ADMINISTRATIVE ROTATION THE PROJECT ABRUPTLY LOST SUPPORT. THIS UNEXPECTED EVENT EMPHASISES THE NEED FOR CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF ALL ACTORS ENTERING AND/OR LEAVING THE SYSTEM, WHICH CAN RADICALLY CHANGE THE INTERACTIONS AMONG THEM AND, THEREFORE, THE WHOLE MANAGEMENT CONTEXT.

SIMULATION RESULTS INDICATED THAT VERTICAL MIXING DUE TO WIND FORCING INCREASED THE BOTTOM DO CONCENTRATION. RIVER DISCHARGE ENHANCED STRATIFICATION IN DEEP LOCATIONS BUT PROPAGATED VERTICAL MIXING IN THE SHALLOW UPPER ESTUARY. FINALLY, TIDAL FORCING HEAVILY INFLUENCED BOTTOM LAYER DO CONCENTRATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE RIVER ESTUARY.	***

SIMULATION MODELING IS USED AS A TOOL TO EVALUATE IMPACTS OF GROUNDWATER WITHDRAWALS ON THE AQUIFERS. USING AVAILABLE MONITORING DATA, A REGIONAL THREE DIMENSIONAL VARIABLE DENSITY GROUNDWATER MODEL (SEAWAT) WAS PREVIOUSLY CALIBRATED TO THE EASTERN SHORES AQUIFER SYSTEM. IN GENERAL, DISTRIBUTED PARAMETER VALUES WERE DETERMINED BY KRIGING VALUES AROUND SPECIFIED OR CALIBRATED PARAMETER VALUES AT 21 PILOT POINT LOCATIONS SPREAD ACROSS THE EASTERN SHORE OF VIRGINIA. AFTER CALIBRATION, AN UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS OF THE MODELS PERFORMANCE WAS COMPLETED, AND IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT IN ORDER TO MOST COST EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE THE MODEL ACCURACY TO FACILITATE MANAGEMENT, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ANY ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTION BE FOCUSED ON THE KEY MODELING OBJECTIVES, WHICH ARE PREDICTING HYDRAULIC HEAD AND CHLORIDE CONCENTRATIONS UNDER PUMPING CONDITIONS. THE WORK DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER DEVELOPS AND DEMONSTRATES A METHODOLOGY TO IDENTIFY THE MOST USEFUL LOCATIONS, WITH RESPECT TO IMPROVING MODEL ACCURACY, FOR INSTALLATION OF NEW MULTILAYER NESTED GROUNDWATER MONITORING WELLS. FIRST, CRITICAL SUBREGIONS WHERE ADDITIONAL DATA MAY BE USEFUL WERE IDENTIFIED. THEN A SET OF HYPOTHETICAL NEW NESTED OBSERVATION WELLS WERE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT EACH CRITICAL SUBREGION WITHIN THE MODEL. FOR EACH POTENTIAL OBSERVATION WELL SITE, THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF DATA COLLECTION AT THAT LOCATION ON THE PREDICTION OF HYDRAULIC HEAD VALUES WAS ESTIMATED USING THE CUMULATIVE SENSITIVITY OF THE RELEVANT PILOT POINT PARAMETERS TO DATA AT THE NEW OBSERVATION WELL. THIS CUMULATIVE SENSITIVITY WAS CALCULATED BY SUMMING THE DIMENSIONLESS SCALED SENSITIVITIES OF THE NEW OBSERVATION OVER ALL THE RELEVANT PARAMETER VALUES. THE IMPACT OF COLLECTION OF NEW HYDRAULIC HEAD INFORMATION ON THE PREDICTION OF CHLORIDE CONCENTRATIONS WAS ALSO ESTIMATED BY DETERMINING THE CUMULATIVE SENSITIVITY OF THE PILOT POINT PARAMETER MOST SENSITIVE TO CHLORIDE CONCENTRATIONS BASED ON THE PREDICTION SCALED SENSITIVITIES. ONCE CUMULATIVE SENSITIVITIES WERE CALCULATED FOR EACH POTENTIAL OBSERVATION WELL SITE, MAPS OF THE INFLUENCE OF NEW OBSERVATIONS WERE CREATED AND USED TO IDENTIFY THE MOST EFFECTIVE LOCATION WITHIN EACH CRITICAL SUBREGION TO INSTALL A NEW NESTED OBSERVATION WELL.	***

EVAPOTRANSPIRATION OF IRRIGATION WATER, DISPLACEMENT OF UNSATURATED ZONE SOLUTES, ENHANCED MIXING WITH RELICT SEAWATER AND SEAWATER INTRUSION ARE MECHANISMS CONSIDERED TO EXPLAIN THE OBSERVED INCREASE. THE FLOODPLAIN AQUIFER IS COMPRISED OF COMPLEX SUCCESSIONS OF QUATERNARY TERRIGENOUS AND MARINE SEDIMENTS HOSTING GROUNDWATER WITH CL( ) CONCENTRATIONS FROM <50 MG/L TO >50,000 MG/L. THE LOWEST SALINITY GROUNDWATER IS FOUND ADJACENT TO THE BURDEKIN RIVER AND WITHIN PALAEOCHANNELS DISSECTING THE FLOODPLAIN. CL( ) CONCENTRATIONS <100 MG/L, TOGETHER WITH NO(3)( )/CL MASS RATIOS >0.1 INDICATE THE FRESH GROUNDWATER ORIGINATES FROM VERTICAL INFILTRATION OF RAINWATER AND IRRIGATION WATER ENTRAINED WITH AGRICULTURAL NITROGEN THROUGH THE COARSE GRAINED PALAEOCHANNEL SEDIMENTS. NA/CL RATIOS SIMILAR TO THE BURDEKIN RIVER INDICATE THAT LATERAL DISCHARGE FROM THE RIVER CHANNEL TO THE FLOODPLAIN AQUIFER ALSO ACCOUNTS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF LOW SALINITY GROUNDWATER. TIDAL AND NEAR SHORE MARINE SEDIMENTS DEPOSITED DURING PLEISTOCENE AND HOLOCENE HIGH SEA LEVEL STANDS HOST HIGHLY SALINE GROUNDWATER (CL( ) 20,000 80,000 MG/L) UP TO 15 KM INLAND. IN MANY AREAS OF THE FLOODPLAIN, NESTED PIEZOMETER LOCATIONS REVEAL OLDER, MORE SALINE WATER AT DEPTH. NA AND CL( ) CONCENTRATIONS OF MORE THAN 8000 FLOODPLAIN GROUNDWATER SAMPLES COLLECTED OVER A 40 YR PERIOD FALL ON A MIXING LINE BETWEEN RIVER WATER/FRESH GROUNDWATER AND MODERN/RELICT SEAWATER INDICATING THAT INTERMEDIATE SALINITY WATERS HAVE EVOLVED OVER TIME THROUGH VARYING DEGREES OF MIXING BETWEEN THE TWO END MEMBER COMPOSITIONS. TEMPORAL TRENDS IN NA AND CL CONCENTRATIONS INDICATE THAT INCREASES IN GROUNDWATER SALINITY ACROSS THE FLOODPLAIN ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO THIS MIXING PROCESS, AND THAT EVAPOTRANSPIRATION FROM IRRIGATED CROPS AND DISPLACEMENT OF UNSATURATED ZONE SOLUTES HAS HAD LESS OF AN EFFECT. THIS SALINIZATION PROCESS, WHICH INCLUDES DISPLACEMENT OF RELICT SEAWATER WITHIN THE AQUIFER AND SEAWATER INTRUSION, IS LIKELY EXACERBATED BY EXTRACTION FROM >1400 PRODUCTION BORES AND ENHANCED RECHARGE ACROSS THE FLOODPLAIN. HALTING AND REVERSING THE ONGOING GROUNDWATER SALINIZATION WILL REQUIRE A MIXTURE OF SETTING AND MEETING LOCAL AND REGIONAL GROUNDWATER TARGETS (WATER TABLE DEPTHS AND GROUNDWATER QUALITY), AND WHERE NEEDED IMPLEMENTING APPROPRIATE DEEP DRAINAGE AND DRAINAGE DISPOSAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES.

AS A MEANS TO INVESTIGATE FECAL CONTAMINATION AND LOADING OF FIB TO THE NRE, A CONTINUOUS AUTOMATED SAMPLER (ISCO) OUTFITTED WITH FLOW MODULES AND WATER QUALITY PROBES WAS PLACED IN FOUR FIRST ORDER TIDAL CREEK HEADWATERS. TOTAL STORM DISCHARGE AND BACTERIAL LOAD FOR ESCHERICHIA COLI (EC) AND ENTEROCOCCUS SPP. (ENT) WERE CALCULATED USING GRAPHICAL VOLUMETRIC FLOW CALCULATIONS AND INTERPOLATION OF FIB MEASUREMENTS OVER EACH STORMS DURATION FOR 10 STORMS.

TOTAL STORM LOADING, AVERAGED ACROSS ALL STORMS, WAS AS MUCH AS 30 AND 37 TIMES GREATER THAN EQUIVALENT DURATION OF BASEFLOW LOADING FOR EC AND ENT, RESPECTIVELY. WITHIN THE FIRST 30% OF CREEK STORM VOLUME FOR ALL STORMS AND ALL CREEKS COMBINED, A MEAN CUMULATIVE LOAD OF ONLY 37% AND 44% OF THE TOTAL EC AND ENT CELLS, RESPECTIVELY, WAS DISCHARGED, INDICATING THESE CREEKS ARE NOT DEMONSTRATING A FIRST FLUSH SCENARIO FOR FIB.

FIB WAS CORRELATED WITH TSS (WEAK), FLOW RATE (STRONG), AND DIFFERENT STAGES (BASE, RISING, PEAK, AND FALLING) OF THE HYDROGRAPH (STRONG). POLLUTOGRAPHS INDICATE LARGE INTRO STORM VARIABILITY OF FIB, AND THE NEED FOR MORE INTENSIVE SAMPLING THROUGHOUT A STORM IN ORDER TO ATTAIN ACCURATE FIB CONTAMINANT ESTIMATES. INSTREAM SEDIMENT CONCENTRATIONS RANGED FROM 5 TO 478 (MPN/G) AND 13 TO 776 (MPN/G) FOR EC AND ENT, RESPECTIVELY, INDICATING SEDIMENT AS A SOURCE, BUT A MINOR RESERVOIR. THIS OVERALL APPROACH FOR CALCULATING LOADING IN HEADWATER TIDAL CREEKS IS DETAILED. ACCURATE LOADING CHARACTERIZATION OF FIB DURING STORMS AND DRY WEATHER CONDITIONS, AND UNDERSTANDING INTRO STORM FIB CONCENTRATIONS, IS IMPERATIVE FOR UNDERSTANDING PATTERNS OF WATER QUALITY IMPAIRMENT, ESTABLISHING MANAGEMENT PLANNING, AND DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE MITIGATION STRATEGIES.

SEVERAL MECHANISMS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO EXPLAIN THE RECENT INCREASE IN SENSITIVITY. TWO COMMONLY CITED MECHANISMS ARE BOTTOM WATER REDUCING CONDITIONS PREVENTING NITRIFICATION AND THUS DENITRIFICATION, LEADING TO MORE N RECYCLING AND PRODUCTION OF OXYGEN CONSUMING ORGANIC MATTER, AND CARRYOVER OF ORGANIC MATTER FROM PREVIOUS YEARS INCREASING OXYGEN DEMAND, MAKING THE SYSTEM MORE SENSITIVE. WE USE MODELS INFORMED BY THESE MECHANISMS AND FIT WITH BAYESIAN INFERENCE TO EXPLORE CHANGES IN GULF OF MEXICO HYPOXIA SENSITIVITY. WE SHOW THAT A MODEL INCLUDING AN ANNUALLY FIT PARAMETER REPRESENTING VARIATION IN THE FRACTION OF NUTRIENT LOADING AND RECYCLING CONTRIBUTING TO BOTTOM WATER OXYGEN DEMAND PROVIDES A GOOD FIT TO OBSERVATIONS AND IS NOT IMPROVED BY EXPLICIT INCLUSION OF ORGANIC MATTER CARRYOVER TO SUBSEQUENT YEARS. BOTH MODELS SUPPORT TWO STEPWISE INCREASES IN SYSTEM SENSITIVITY DURING THE PERIOD OF RECORD. THIS CHANGE IN SENSITIVITY HAS GREATLY INCREASED THE NUTRIENT REDUCTION NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THE ESTABLISHED HYPOXIA GOAL. IF THE GULF REMAINS AT THE CURRENT STATE OF SENSITIVITY, OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS A ROUGHLY 70% REDUCTION OF SPRING TN LOADS FROM THE 1988 1996 AVERAGE OF 6083 TON/DAY MAY BE REQUIRED.	***

THE GDES ARE THREATENED BY INCREASING GROUNDWATER ABSTRACTIONS AND RISKS OF POLLUTION. HYDROGEOLOGICAL EXPLORATION WORK IS NEEDED AS BASIS FOR SOUND GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT. A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH WAS USED TO STUDY THIS DATA SCARCE REGION. GEOCHEMICAL DATA AND PHREATIC SURFACE MEASUREMENTS SHOWED DISTINCT HYDROGEOLOGICAL UNITS IN THE GROUNDWATER CATCHMENT OF SIAN KAAN. THE HILLY SOUTHWESTERN AREAS HAD A LOW HYDRAULIC PERMEABILITY, LIKELY CAUSED BY A GEOLOGY CONTAINING GYPSUM, WHEREAS THE TRANSITION ZONE AND FLAT AREAS IN THE EAST AND NORTH HAD A HIGH PERMEABILITY. IN THE LATTER AREAS, THE FRESH GROUNDWATER COULD BE DESCRIBED BY A DUPUIT GHYBEN HERZBERG LENS. GEOPHYSICAL BOREHOLE LOGGING AND TIME DOMAIN ELECTROMAGNETIC SOUNDINGS IDENTIFIED A SHALLOW, LOW RESISTIVE AND HIGH GAMMA RADIATION LAYER PRESENT THROUGHOUT THE HILLY AREA AND TRANSITION ZONE. ITS THICKNESS WAS 3 8 M, APPARENT CONDUCTIVITY WAS 200 800 MS/M AND NATURAL GAMMA RADIATION ABOUT 80 COUNTS PR. SECOND. THE LAYER IS PROPOSED TO BE EJECTA FROM THE CHICXULUB IMPACT (CRETACEOUS/PALEOGENE BOUNDARY). SPATIAL ESTIMATES OF RECHARGE WERE CALCULATED FROM MODIS IMAGERY USING THE TRIANGLE METHOD. AVERAGE RECHARGE CONSTITUTED 17% OF MEAN ANNUAL PRECIPITATION IN THE STUDY AREA. RECHARGE WAS GREATEST IN THE HILLY AREA AND TOWARDS VALLADOLID.

IN ORDER TO PREDICT THE EFFECTS OF THE PROPOSED ALTERATIONS ON THE HYDRODYNAMICS OF THE LAGOON, A WELL TESTED HYDRODYNAMIC DISPERSION MODEL WAS APPLIED. SIMULATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT CONSIDERING BOTH IDEALISED AND REALISTIC TIDE AND WIND SCENARIOS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT WITH THE NEW STRUCTURES THE LIDO SUB BASIN TENDS TO INCREASE ITS EXTENSION DUE THE SOUTHWARD MOVEMENT OF THE WATERSHED, AT THE EXPENSE OF THE CHIOGGIA SUB BASIN, WHEREAS THE MALAMOCCO SUB BASIN CHANGES ITS RELATIVE POSITION, BUT NOT ITS EXTENSION. THE RESIDENCE TIME SHOWS VARIATIONS IN AGREEMENT WITH THIS TREND, DECREASING IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE LIDO SUB BASIN AND INCREASING IN THE INNER PART OF THE CHIOGGIA SUB BASIN. THE VARIATIONS IN RESIDENCE TIME AND RETURN FLOW FACTOR INDICATE THAT THEY ARE CAUSED BY CHANGES IN BOTH INSTANTANEOUS CURRENT VELOCITIES AND SEA LAGOON INTERACTION. IN FACT THE NEW BREAKWATERS IN FRONT OF THE MALAMOCCO AND CHIOGGIA INLETS MODIFY THE LENGTH AND DIRECTION OF THE OUTFLOW JET (UP TO 1 MS( 1)) AND THE PATTERNS OF THE CURRENTS AROUND THE INLETS AND THE NEARBY COAST. THE NEW ARTIFICIAL ISLAND IN THE LIDO INLET CHANGES THE CURRENT PATTERN AND INCREASES THE CURRENT VELOCITY ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE CHANNEL PROPAGATING THIS EFFECT UP TO THE VENICE CITY. THE RISKS AND BENEFITS INDIVIDUATED FROM OUR CONCLUSION ARE THAT THE LIDO SUB BASIN CAN IMPROVE ITS RENEWAL TIME, BUT THE MORE INTENSE CURRENT SPEEDS CAN BE A RISK FOR THE CONSERVATION OF HABITATS AND INFRASTRUCTURES.

HEREIN WE PROVIDE A REVIEW, NEW ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS OF EXISTING WORK, MUCH OF IT PREVIOUSLY ONLY AVAILABLE IN GOVERNMENT REPORTS, AND INTEGRATE OUR RECENT RESEARCH ON THE TOPIC. WE OUTLINE CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE GAPS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE TIME THAT CONSTRUCTION BEGINS ON ANY FUTURE LARGE DIVERSIONS. THE FOCUS OF THIS STUDY IS ON RIVER SIDE ISSUES AND THE POLICY CONSIDERATIONS THAT ARISE FROM THEM. THE STUDY INCLUDES A QUANTITATIVE EXAMINATION OF THE SEDIMENT BUDGET OF THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER AS A REGION OF POTENTIAL DIVERSION CONSTRUCTION IN SOUTH LOUISIANA, DUE TO ITS CRITICAL CONTROL ON ANY FUTURE MANAGEMENT PLANS THAT INCLUDE LARGE DIVERSIONS. WE CONCLUDE THAT DEVELOPMENT OF A COORDINATED SYSTEM OF DIVERSIONS AND OTHER RESTORATION STRATEGIES FOR LAND BUILDING WILL REQUIRE PARCELING THIS SEDIMENT BUDGET OUT BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THIS IS ONLY POSSIBLE IF THE INPUT FUNCTION AND ITS VARIABILITY IS WELL UNDERSTOOD. IT IS CLEAR THAT NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS ARE THE ONLY WAY TO ADEQUATELY PREDICT THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF MULTIPLE DIVERSIONS AND OTHER RESTORATION PROJECTS, SUCH AS DREDGE FED PIPELINES, ON THE RIVER CHANNEL FOR NAVIGATION, FLOOD CONTROL AND SEDIMENT REGIME. NUMERICAL MODELS ALSO PROVIDE THE ONLY WAY TO PROPERLY EXAMINE DIVERSION STRUCTURES TO MAXIMIZE THEIR SEDIMENT CAPTURE AND MINIMIZE ANY NEGATIVE IMPACTS. THE STATUS OF THESE MODELS AND THEIR APPLICATION TO LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER CHANNEL HYDRODYNAMICS AND SEDIMENT TRANSPORT IS EXAMINED HEREIN. (C) 2010 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

IN THIS STUDY, THE STREAMFLOW REGIME OF 12 STREAMS AND THE CHANNEL MORPHOLOGIES OF 11 STREAMS WERE COMPARED FOR STUDY SITES IN THE PINELANDS REGION OF NEW JERSEY WITH UPSTREAM ACTIVE CRANBERRY BOGS, UPSTREAM ABANDONED CRANBERRY BOGS, AND BASINS WITH NO APPARENT AGRICULTURAL HISTORY. FLOW REGIME METRICS INCLUDED MEASURES OF LOW FLOW, MEDIAN FLOW, AND BANKFULL DISCHARGE, TWO MEASURES OF STREAMFLOW VARIABILITY (SPREAD AND A MODIFIED RICHARDS BAKER FLASHINESS INDEX), AND THE FREQUENCY OF OVERBANK FLOODING. STREAM CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY METRICS INCLUDED AVERAGE BANK SLOPE, AVERAGE BANKFULL WIDTH, AVERAGE BANKFULL DEPTH, AVERAGE BANKFULL WIDTH TO DEPTH RATIO, AND AVERAGE BANKFULL AREA. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN STREAM TYPES WERE APPARENT FOR ANY OF THE METRICS. BASIN AREA NORMALIZED STREAMFLOW VALUES OF ALL 12 STUDY SITES WERE HIGHLY CORRELATED TO EACH OTHER. SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS EXISTED BETWEEN SOME OF THE FLOW REGIME AND CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY METRICS. DUE TO THE LACK OF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN STREAM TYPES, IT APPEARS THAT NEITHER HISTORIC NOR CURRENT CRANBERRY AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES CONSIDERABLY INFLUENCE FLOW REGIMES OR THE CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY OF STREAMS IN THE NEW JERSEY PINELANDS.	***

WATERSHED SUBDIVISION LEVEL IS CONTROLLED BY THE CRITICAL SOURCE AREA (CSA) WHICH DEFINES THE MINIMUM DRAINAGE AREA REQUIRED TO FORM THE ORIGIN OF A STREAM. SWAT WAS CALIBRATED ON A 15.7 KM2 SUBDRAINAGE WITHIN THE LITTLE RIVER EXPERIMENTAL WATERSHED, GEORGIA. THE CALIBRATED PARAMETER SET WAS APPLIED TO 32 WATERSHED CONFIGURATIONS CONSISTING OF FOUR FILTERW REPRESENTATIONS FOR EACH OF EIGHT CSA LEVELS. STREAMFLOW PREDICTIONS WERE STABLE REGARDLESS OF WATERSHED SUBDIVISION AND FILTERW CONFIGURATION. PREDICTED SEDIMENT AND NUTRIENT LOADS FROM UPLAND AREAS DECREASED AS CSA INCREASED WHEN SPATIAL VARIATIONS OF RIPARIAN BUFFERS ARE CONSIDERED. SEDIMENT AND NUTRIENT YIELD AT THE WATERSHED OUTLET WAS RESPONSIVE TO DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF CSA AND FILTERW DEPENDING ON SELECTED IN STREAM PROCESSES.

TO ACHIEVE THIS AIM, AN APPROXIMATE METHOD WAS DEVELOPED TO DEPICT THE NONLINEAR WAVE PARAMETERS AS A WAVE IS PROPAGATED ACROSS THE NEARSHORE ZONE, WHERE THE WAVE IS CONSIDERED TO BE TRANSFORMED BY THE PROCESSES OF SHOALING, REFRACTION AND BREAKING. NON LINEAR APPROXIMATIONS FOR THE PARAMETERS OF WAVE HEIGHT, WAVE LENGTH, WAVE ORBITAL VELOCITIES AND VELOCITY MOMENTS ARE DESCRIBED BY THIS METHOD AND THE RESULTS COMPARED PRIMARILY WITH EXPERIMENTAL DATA FROM BOTH PLANAR BEACHES AND BARRED PROFILES. THE RESULTS OF THIS VALIDATION EXERCISE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE NEW METHOD CAN ADEQUATELY DESCRIBE THE RELEVANT NON LINEAR WAVE PARAMETERS.

GROUNDWATER IS EXTENSIVELY USED IN SRI LANKA TODAY, FOR AGRICULTURE, DOMESTIC USE AND INDUSTRY/TOURISM. GROUNDWATER ACCESS, AVAILABILITY AND VULNERABILITY ARE GOVERNED BY SIX MAJOR TYPES OF AQUIFER SYSTEMS OF WHICH THE MOST PREVALENT IS THE REGOLITH AQUIFERS IN THE CENTRAL HARD ROCK AREAS OF THE ISLAND. UNCONTROLLED GROUNDWATER USE AND CONTAMINATION OR NATURAL POOR QUALITY ARE LEADING TO ACCESS LIMITATIONS AND HEALTH CONCERNS. THE TSUNAMI SEVERELY AFFECTED GROUNDWATER IN THE COASTAL AREAS AND FUNCTIONED AS A WAKE UP CALL TO FURTHER EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF GROUNDWATER FOR LIFE SUPPORTING FUNCTIONS. DESPITE AN EMERGING AWARENESS, GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT IS IN ITS INFANCY, WITH THE ATTITUDE OF GROUNDWATER DEVELOPMENT STILL NOT CONVERTED INTO AN APPROACH OF ACTIVE MANAGEMENT. THE ROLE OF GROUNDWATER IN ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF APPROPRIATE WATER MANAGEMENT INSTITUTIONS NEEDS TO BE HIGHLIGHTED AND SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED IN POLICY DISCUSSIONS.	***

THE SPANISH WATER RESOURCES NATIONAL PLAN (PHN, 2005) FORESEES TO ACHIEVE 3 MM(3)/DAY OF WATER RESOURCE THROUGH A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE DESALINATED WATER PRODUCTION, WATER RECYCLING AND MODERNIZATION OF IRRIGATION AND SUPPLY INFRASTRUCTURES. WITH RESPECT TO DESALINATION, THIS PLAN FORESEES AN ADDITIONAL FLOW RATE OF 1.55 MM(3)/DAY. THE PLANTS PROJECTED UNDER THE PHN (2005) USE REVERSE OSMOSIS TECHNOLOGY WITH CONVERSION RATES BETWEEN 40% AND 50%, WITH THE AMOUNT OF FRESH DESALINATED WATER AND BRINE EFFLUENT BEING SIMILAR. THE BRINE IS DISCHARGED INTO THE MEDITERRANEAN COASTAL WATERS, CAUSING A POTENTIALLY HARMFUL IMPACT ON THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT, ESPECIALLY ON THE STENOHALINE BENTHIC COMMUNITIES: POSIDONIA OCEANICA AND CYMODOCEA NODOSA SEAGRASSES.

THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION ESTABLISHED THE WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH SYSTEMS NETWORK TO TEST VARIOUS ASPECTS OF REAL TIME OBSERVATORY DESIGN AND OPERATION, AND CORPUS CHRISTI BAY (TX) WAS SELECTED AS ONE OF THE WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH SYSTEMS TEST BEDS. IMPLEMENTATION OF A REAL TIME OBSERVATION SYSTEM FACES CHALLENGES SUCH AS USE OF HETEROGENEOUS MONITORING INSTRUMENTATION, MEASUREMENT OF CRITICAL PARAMETERS AT GREATER SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION, REDUCTION OF SENSOR BIOFOULING, RELIABLE DATA ACQUISITION AND DELIVERY, AND DATA MANAGEMENT. WE DEVELOPED A ROBOTIC PROFILER SYSTEM THAT MOVES A SUITE OF WATER QUALITY SENSORS IN THE WATER COLUMN, COLLECTING DATA AT MULTIPLE DEPTHS. THIS SYSTEM SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES BIOFOULING OF THE SENSORS AND ACCOMMODATES A DIVERSE ARRAY OF SENSORS THAT MEASURE VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS. IN ADDITION, THE ASSOCIATED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDES SENSOR DATA TO STAKEHOLDERS IN REAL TIME AND ALLOWS REMOTE ACCESS TO THE FIXED ROBOTIC PLATFORMS, WHICH SUPPORTS INSTRUMENT MANAGEMENT, DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL, IMPLEMENTATION OF EVENT BASED SAMPLING SCHEMES, SENSOR TROUBLESHOOTING, AND SO ON.

THIS CASE STUDY EXAMINES ESTABLISHING AN EFFLUENT TARGET CONCENTRATION FOR BMPS THAT RELATES TO THE HEALTH OF MACROINVERTEBRATES IN THE RECEIVING WATER. IN NORTH CAROLINA, 193 AMBIENT WATER QUALITY MONITORING STATIONS WERE PAIRED WITH BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATE HEALTH RATINGS COLLECTED IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY. WATER QUALITY FOR THE SITES RANGED FROM EXCELLENT TO POOR AND WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE DISTINCT ECOREGIONS: MOUNTAIN, PIEDMONT, AND COASTAL. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS WERE FOUND IN ONE OR MORE ECOREGIONS FOR DISSOLVED OXYGEN, FECAL CONFORM, NH(3), NO(2 3) N, TOTAL KJELDAHL NITROGEN, TOTAL NITROGEN (TN), AND TOTAL PHOSPHORUS (TP). BMPS CAN THEN BE SELECTED AND DESIGNED TO MEET THESE TARGET EFFLUENT CONCENTRATIONS. BASED UPON THIS RESEARCH, A DEVELOPMENT, AND THEREFORE SET OF BMPS, IN PIEDMONT NORTH CAROLINA COULD BE REQUIRED TO RELEASE TN AND TP EFFLUENT CONCENTRATIONS OF 0.99 MG/L AND 0.11 MG/L, RESPECTIVELY. THESE CONCENTRATIONS ARE BOTH ASSOCIATED WITH GOOD BENTHOS HEALTH.

METHODOLOGIES COMMONLY USED TO ESTIMATE FLOOD DAMAGE TO BUILDINGS ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON AFTERMATH SURVEYS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF INSURANCE CLAIMS DATA. THESE METHODOLOGIES RARELY ACCOUNT FOR FLOODING HYDRODYNAMICS, AND THUS DO NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY FLOODWATER CONTACT AND THOSE CAUSED BY FLOODWATER VELOCITY. A NEW STOCHASTIC METHODOLOGY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO ESTIMATE THE DIRECT IMPACT OF FLOOD ACTIONS ON BUILDINGS AND TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED DAMAGE. BUILDING VULNERABILITY IS MODELED BASED ON ANALYTICAL REPRESENTATIONS OF THE FAILURE MECHANISMS OF INDIVIDUAL BUILDING COMPONENTS. THE FLOOD ACTIONS GENERATED DURING DIFFERENT FLOODING EVENTS ARE ASSESSED AND COMPARED TO THE RESISTANCE OF EACH BUILDING COMPONENT. THE ASSESSED FLOOD ACTIONS INCLUDE: HYDROSTATIC AND HYDRODYNAMIC FORCES, WAVES, TURBULENT BORES, DEBRIS IMPACTS, AND TIME DEPENDENT LOCAL SOIL SCOUR. MONTE CARLO SIMULATION WAS USED TO SYNTHETICALLY EXPAND THE AVAILABLE BUILDING DATA, TO PERFORM LOAD RESISTANCE ANALYSIS, AND TO ACCOUNT FOR THE UNCERTAINTY OF INPUT PARAMETERS. THE PRIMARY RESULT FROM THIS STUDY IS THE EXPECTED FLOOD DAMAGE TO INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS, AND IT IS EXPRESSED AS A THREE DIMENSIONAL FUNCTIONS DEPENDENT ON BOTH FLOODWATER DEPTH AND FLOODWATER VELOCITY. THE RESULTS SHOW HOW FLOODWATER VELOCITY CAN INCREASE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE FLOOD DAMAGE OUTCOME COMPARED TO THOSE THAT SOLELY CONSIDER WATER DEPTH. THIS DEMONSTRATES THE REAL NEED FOR CONSIDERING FLOODWATER HYDRODYNAMICS IN THE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT OF BUILDINGS LOCATED IN FLOOD PRONE AREAS. ALTHOUGH THE PRESENT STUDY FOCUSES ON THE VULNERABILITY OF REINFORCED CONCRETE FRAME BUILDINGS WITH INFILL CONCRETE BLOCK WALLS, THE METHODOLOGY CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO OTHER TYPES OF STRUCTURES. THIS METHODOLOGY COULD SERVE AS A DECISION MAKING TOOL TO ASSIST ENGINEERS AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY ZONES OF HIGH RISK, AND TO IMPLEMENT THE NECESSARY PREVENTIVE MEASURES AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES TO MINIMIZE THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF POTENTIAL FLOODING EVENTS.	***

THE PROJECT INCORPORATED RIPRAP, FIBER MATTING, GEOTEXTILE, AND VEGETATION AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CONVENTIONAL HARD STRUCTURES FOR EROSION CONTROL. AS PART OF THE RESTORATION EXPANSION, A DETAILED EVALUATION OF THE PREVIOUS PROJECT WAS COMPLETED AT SEVERAL LEVELS, INCLUDING THE LANDSCAPE, GEOTECHNICAL DESIGN, ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS, AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE FINDINGS INDICATED THAT THE VEGETATION AND ITS UNDERLYING GEOTECHNICAL INTEGRITY HAVE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN EROSION MITIGATION. OVERALL THE PROJECT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN THE PROTECTION OF THE SHORELINE AND WAS SHOWN TO BE MORE ECOLOGICALLY BENEFICIAL THAN OTHER HARD STRUCTURES. BASED ON THE PRELIMINARY SUCCESS OF THE INITIAL PROJECT, THE RESTORATION TECHNIQUES WERE ADAPTED FOR ANOTHER BEACH EXTENSION TO THE WEST. THE ASSESSMENT DID REVEAL SOME WEAKNESSES IN THE ORIGINAL PROJECT DESIGN INCLUDING THE NEED FOR MORE SUBSTANTIAL TOE PROTECTION AND PERIODIC MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS. BASED ON THESE ASSESSMENTS, SOME ADDITIONAL NEW METHODS FOR THE RESTORATION EXTENSION WERE PROPOSED AND IMPLEMENTED. THE BROADER APPLICABILITY OF THIS RESTORATION APPROACH OUTSIDE THE LOCAL REGION HAS BEEN PRESENTED THROUGH SEVERAL OUTREACH ACTIVITIES AND DELIVERED TO COASTAL PLANNERS AND LAND OWNERS THROUGHOUT THE TEXAS COASTAL BEND AND NORTHERN MEXICO.

HOWEVER, ROUTE PLANNING HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX OVER THE YEARS AND THE PLANNING PROCESS REQUIRES A LARGE AMOUNT OF OCEANIC ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION. IN ORDER TO USE THE OCEANIC ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION EFFECTIVELY AND IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF ROUTE PLANNING, THIS RESEARCH EMPLOYED A GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS) AS THE PLATFORM FOR ENABLING TWO PHASE AUTOMATIC ROUTE GENERATION DESIGN. FIRSTLY, THROUGH GISS SPATIAL DATA MANAGEMENT, SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND GEOMETRIC COMPUTATION CAPABILITY, THE PRESENCE OF THE OBSTACLE IS DETECTED AND CANDIDATE ROUTES ARE AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED. THESE ARE PROVIDED TO THE EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM AS THE BASIS FOR PRELIMINARY POPULATION CALCULATION. THEN, A SPECIALLY DESIGNED EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM IS USED FOR ROUTE ELIMINATION TO OBTAIN THE OPTIMAL ROUTE, RESULTING IN THE MOST RECOMMENDED ROUTES THAT ENCOMPASS SAFETY AND ECONOMY. THIS TECHNIQUE IS MORE EFFICIENT THAN EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION TECHNIQUES THAT USE TRADITIONAL RANDOM SEARCHES. AT THE SAME TIME, THIS TARGETS SAFETY AND ECONOMY, PROVIDING A REFERENCE FOR DEVELOPING A ROUTE PLANNING STRATEGY.	***

IN SUCH REGIONS, USE OF TREATED WASTEWATER (TWW) IS A VIABLE OPTION IF PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED. THE GOAL OF THIS PAPER IS TO ADDRESS THE USE OF TWW IN AGRICULTURE WHILE CONSIDERING NET BENEFIT, ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY OF WATER USE (EEWU), ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS, AND PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS. THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY CONSIDERS PUBLIC HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT AND MULTI CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS TO ASSESS THE BENEFICIAL USE OF TWW IN AGRICULTURE. THE METHODOLOGY WAS DEMONSTRATED FOR THE GAZA STRIP. THE HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT SUGGESTS THAT INCREASING THE ELAPSED TIME BETWEEN IRRIGATION AND CONSUMPTION AND SWITCHING FROM SURFACE TO SPRINKLER AND DRIP IRRIGATION ARE PRACTICAL MEASURES TO REDUCE PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS. THE OPTIMIZATION AND DECISION ANALYSES SHOW THAT PROPER ALLOCATION OF FRESHWATER AND TWW AND DISTRIBUTION OF LAND AREA BY CROP TYPE CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE NET BENEFIT AND EEWU. IN MOST CASES, NET BENEFIT INCREASED BY 44%, GROUNDWATER USE REDUCED 29% WHILE INCREASING THE EEWU BY THREEFOLD COMPARED WITH THE EXISTING CONDITIONS. THE MULTI CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS WITH WEIGHTED GOAL PROGRAMMING CAN DEVELOP FLEXIBLE MANAGEMENT OPTIONS THAT CONSIDERS A GIVEN DECISION MAKER PREFERENCE. WHEN GROUNDWATER ABSTRACTION FOR AGRICULTURE REDUCED FROM 57 TO 36 MM3 AS PER DECISION ANALYSIS, THE CORRESPONDING AREA BELOW MEAN SEA LEVEL DECREASED BY 58% INDICATING SIGNIFICANT AQUIFER RECOVERY.	***

THE VALUE OF THE MSW MANAGEMENT SELF SUFFICIENCY INDICATOR REFLECTS THE CAPACITY OF A SYSTEM TO MANAGE THE AMOUNT OF MSW IT ACCEPTS AND THE GRADE OF SUSTAINABILITY OF THE TREATMENT PRACTICES FOLLOWED WITHIN THE SYSTEM, VALUING AS THE BEST OPTION THE USE OF RESIDUES AS RAW MATERIALS. COMPARED WITH WASTE RECOVERY RATES, THE NEW INDICATOR PROVES TO BE MORE COMPREHENSIVE IN ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MSW MANAGEMENT PLANS IN MEDIUM SCALE URBAN REGIONS, EVALUATING THE CAPACITY OF A SOCIOECONOMIC SYSTEM TO CLOSE ITS MATERIAL CIRCLES. IN COMBINATION WITH INFORMATION PROVIDED BY OTHER URBAN SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS, AS WATER USE AND AIR POLLUTION, THE INDICATOR CAN BE A USEFUL TOOL IN DECISION MAKING. IN THIS PAPER.

OVEREXPLOITATION OF COASTAL AQUIFERS AND POLLUTION ARE AMONG THE MAIN PROBLEMS RELATED TO GROUNDWATER RESOURCES ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT IN SANTIAGO ISLAND (CABO VERDE). BRACKISH GROUNDWATER IS THE ONLY AVAILABLE WATER TYPE IN THE REGION THAT IS BEING PROVIDED TO NUMEROUS PARTS OF THE ISLAND SUCH AS PRAIA BAIXO, MONTENEGRO, AND CHARCO FOR AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN SUPPLY. SOLUTE AND ISOTOPE DATA OBTAINED IN DIFFERENT GROUNDWATER SYSTEMS WERE USED IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF GROUNDWATER RESOURCES DEGRADATION. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE INFLUENCE OF THE ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES ON THE WATER QUALITY AND THE MAIN ORIGIN OF THE SALTS IN GROUNDWATER, A STATISTICAL APPROACH (PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSES PCA) WAS PERFORMED ON THE PHYSICO CHEMICAL DATA. THE RESULTS OBTAINED INDICATE WATER ROCK INTERACTION MECHANISMS AS THE MAJOR PROCESS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GROUNDWATER QUALITY (MAINLY CALCIUM BICARBONATE TYPE), REFLECTING THE LITHOLOGICAL COMPOSITION OF THE SUBSURFACE SOIL.

THE DATA SEQUENCES COMPRISE WAVE CLIMATE RECORDED BY A NEARSHORE DIRECTIONAL WAVE BUOY AND VIDEO DERIVED SHORELINES OVER A TIME SPAN OF ONE YEAR AND A HALF. THE HYDRODYNAMIC CONDITIONS ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION OF WAVE HEIGHTS AND ALONGSHORE ENERGY FLUXES. THESE ARE THEN RELATED TO SHORELINE CHANGE THROUGH A CCA ANALYSIS. THE CCA ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOUR OF THE WAVE CONDITIONS AND THE SHORELINE POSITION, AND THE RELATION BETWEEN BOTH PATTERNS IS FOUND TO PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE BEACH RESPONSE TO WAVE ACTION. THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE MOVEMENT OF SEDIMENT IS GREATER AT THE SOUTHERN END OF THE STUDY AREA AND THAT THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE SHORELINE RESPONSE TO THE WAVE ACTION. IN THE CASE OF COASTAL MANAGEMENT IT IS MORE OFTEN THE CASE THAT WAVE FORECASTS ARE AVAILABLE ON A ROUTINE BASIS. THE ABILITY OF THE CCA TO PROVIDE USEFUL ESTIMATES OF SHORELINES FROM WAVE CONDITIONS WAS TESTED BY USING MEASURED WAVES TO CALCULATE THE CORRESPONDING SHORELINE POSITION FROM ADDITIONAL DATA AT THE END OF THE SEQUENCES. SHORELINE POSITIONS DETERMINED WITH THE CCA AGREED WELL WITH THE MEASURED ONES. THUS, THE CCA IS FOUND TO BE A USEFUL TOOL TO DETERMINE UNKNOWN SHORELINE POSITIONS AND SUPPORT EFFECTIVE COASTAL MANAGEMENT IF GOOD QUALITY HYDRODYNAMIC AND MORPHOLOGICAL DATA ARE AVAILABLE TO INPUT INTO THE INITIAL SET UP OF THE TECHNIQUE.

THIS WORK PRESENTS AN INTEGRATED REVIEW OF FIELD AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES CONDUCTED IN EASTERN AUSTRALIA THAT EVALUATE NATIVE VEGETATIONS ROLE IN MASS FAILURE OF RIVERBANKS. SEVERAL RESULTS OF THESE STUDIES HAVE GENERAL APPLICATION AND INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: (1) THE PRESENCE OF RIPARIAN FOREST ON RIVERBANKS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD OF EROSION BY MASS FAILURE DUE TO REINFORCEMENT OF RIVERBANK SOILS BY TREE ROOTS AND THIS REDUCED LIKELIHOOD OF MASS FAILURE ENABLES A NARROWER CHANNEL CROSS SECTION THAN WOULD OTHERWISE BE THE CASE FOR MANY AUSTRALIAN COASTAL STREAMS. (2) A NUMBER OF AUSTRALIAN TREE SPECIES HAVE APPARENTLY EVOLVED ROOTS THAT SEEK THE PERMANENT, SUMMER WATER TABLE IN ORDER TO SURVIVE PROLONGED DRY SPELLS, THESE ROOT SYSTEMS ARE PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN MASS FAILURE MITIGATION DUE TO ROOTING DEPTHS THAT ARE COMMONLY GREATER THAN 5 M AND ARE SOMETIMES WELL IN EXCESS OF 20 M.

THE SHALLOW WATER EQUATIONS ARE A SUITABLE TOOL FOR THIS PURPOSE. IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PRESENT STUDY, THEY ARE USED TO PERFORM PREDICTIONS OF ALGAE TRANSPORT IN THE VICINITY OF A HARBOUR, COMBINED TO A 3RD GENERATION SPECTRAL WAVE MODEL TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF NEAR SHORE CURRENTS INDUCED BY WAVE BREAKING IN THE SURF ZONE. THE SIMULATED PATHS OF ALGAE HAVE BEEN PROVED TO BE VERY SENSITIVE TO THE EFFECTS OF THOSE WAVE INDUCED CURRENTS AND EXHIBIT A BEHAVIOUR IN ACCEPTABLE AGREEMENT WITH ON SITE OBSERVATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, THE EFFECTS OF WAVES ON CURRENTS IS REQUIRED TO QUALITATIVELY PREDICT THE LARGE RECIRCULATION PATTERN OBSERVED IN THE VICINITY OF ONE OF THE DYKES OF THE HARBOUR.

THE SITUATION HAS BEEN EXACERBATED FOR REINFORCED CONCRETE COASTAL STRUCTURES DUE TO THE SEAWATER INDUCED CORROSION OF REINFORCING STEEL IN CONCRETE WHICH REDUCES THE LOAD CARRYING CAPACITY OF THE STRUCTURE. THIS COMBINED EFFECT HAS POSED HIGHER RISK TO THE PUBLIC AND NECESSITATED A THOROUGH ASSESSMENT FOR COASTAL STRUCTURES. THE PRESENT PAPER INTRODUCES A TIME DEPENDENT RELIABILITY METHOD TO PREDICT THE RISK OF FAILURES DUE TO THE INCREASED WAVE OVERTOPPING AND REDUCED STRUCTURAL CAPACITY, AND SOME BASIC APPLICATIONS TO ILLUSTRATE ITS USE. A STOCHASTIC PROCESS IS PROPOSED TO MODEL THE TIME VARIANT AND RANDOM NATURE OF SEVERE WAVES. ALSO PROPOSED IS A STRUCTURAL DETERIORATION MODEL TO ALLOW FOR SEAWATER INDUCED STEEL CORROSION IN CONCRETE. IT IS FOUND IN THE EXAMPLE THAT THE RISING SEA LEVELS AND INCREASED SEA STORMINESS REDUCE THE SAFETY AND SERVICEABILITY OF COASTAL DEFENSES. THE METHOD PRESENTED IN THE PAPER CAN PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION FOR STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS, OPERATORS, AND ASSET MANAGERS IN DEVELOPING A RISK INFORMED AND COST EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT SCHEME FOR COASTAL DEFENSES.

ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACILITATORS HAS BEEN THE ADOPTION OF A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK AT A NATIONAL SCALE. THIS FRAMEWORK INVOLVES SEVERAL SCALES OF PLANS (SHORELINE MANAGEMENT PLANS AND STRATEGY PLANS) AS WELL AS SCHEMES. THE RECOGNITION THAT FUNDING SOURCES ARE FINITE, AND THEREFORE NEED TO BE SPENT WISELY, HAS ALSO ENCOURAGED THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE SUSTAINABLE SCHEMES. THIS HAS NECESSITATED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL APPRAISAL METHODOLOGY UNDER WHICH ONLY THE HIGHEST PRIORITY SCHEMES ACHIEVE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING. THE GOVERNMENT ALSO FUNDS A NATIONAL RESEARCH PROGRAMME TO SUPPORT FLOOD AND COASTAL EROSION RISK MANAGEMENT. THIS PAPER GIVES EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THE OUTPUTS OF THIS PROGRAMME, WHICH HAVE INCLUDED STUDIES THAT HAVE LED TO AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF COASTAL PROCESSES, COASTAL EVOLUTION, AND RISK LEVELS, AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL DATA SETS AND MANAGEMENT TOOLS. THE PAPER SUGGESTS SOME FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD BE MADE TO THE RESEARCH PROGRAMME. THE DISCUSSION FOCUSES ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF INCREASING CHOICE OF MANAGED REALIGNMENT AND NO ACTIVE INTERVENTION POLICIES IN THE FUTURE, THEIR POTENTIAL UNPOPULARITY WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS, AND THE CURRENT WORK UNDER WAY TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES.

THE EL NINO/SOUTHERN OSCILLATION IS THE BEST KNOWN PATTERN. ITS GLOBAL EFFECTS ON WEATHER, HYDROLOGY, ECOLOGY AND HUMAN HEALTH HAVE BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED. CLIMATE VARIABILITY MANIFESTED THROUGH ENSO HAS STRONG EFFECTS IN THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES, SEEN IN PRECIPITATION AND STREAM FLOW DATA. HOWEVER, CLIMATE VARIABILITY MAY ALSO AFFECT WATER QUALITY IN NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS AND LOADS, AND HAVE IMPACTS ON ECOSYSTEMS, HEALTH, AND FOOD AVAILABILITY IN THE SOUTHEAST. IN THIS RESEARCH, WE ESTABLISH A TELECONNECTION BETWEEN ENSO AND THE LITTLE RIVER WATERSHED (LRW), GA., AS SEEN IN A SHARED 3 7 YEAR MODE OF VARIABILITY FOR PRECIPITATION, STREAM FLOW, AND NUTRIENT LOAD TIME SERIES. UNIVARIATE WAVELET ANALYSIS OF THE NINO 3.4 INDEX OF SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE (SST) AND OF PRECIPITATION, STREAM FLOW, NO3 CONCENTRATION AND LOAD TIME SERIES FROM THE WATERSHED WAS USED TO IDENTIFY COMMON SIGNALS. SHARED 3 7 YEAR MODES OF VARIABILITY WERE SEEN IN ALL VARIABLES, MOST STRONGLY IN PRECIPITATION, STREAM FLOW AND NUTRIENT LOAD IN STRONG EL NINO YEARS. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SHARED 3 7 YEAR PERIODICITY OVER RED NOISE WITH 95% CONFIDENCE IN SST AND PRECIPITATION, STREAM FLOW, AND NO3 LOAD TIME SERIES WAS CONFIRMED THROUGH CROSS WAVELET AND WAVELET COHERENCE TRANSFORMS, IN WHICH COMMON HIGH POWER AND COVARIANCE WERE COMPUTED FOR EACH SET OF DATA. THE STRONGEST 3 7 YEAR SHARED POWER WAS SEEN IN SST AND STREAM FLOW DATA, WHILE THE STRONGEST CO VARIANCE WAS SEEN IN SST AND NO3 LOAD DATA. THE STRONGEST CROSS CORRELATION WAS SEEN AS A POSITIVE VALUE BETWEEN THE NINO 3.4 AND NO3 LOAD WITH A THREE MONTH LAG. THE TELECONNECTION SEEN IN THE LRW BETWEEN THE NINO 3.4 INDEX AND PRECIPITATION, STREAM FLOW, AND NO3 LOAD CAN BE UTILIZED IN A MODEL TO PREDICT MONTHLY NUTRIENT LOADS BASED ON SHORT TERM CLIMATE VARIABILITY, FACILITATING MANAGEMENT IN HIGH RISK SEASONS.

UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A PREDOMINANT SWELL, ITS CURVED PERIPHERY IN NATURAL ENVIRONMENT MAY REACH STATIC EQUILIBRIUM AND REMAINS STABLE WITHOUT SEDIMENT SUPPLY FROM UPDRIFT AND/OR A RIVERAIN SOURCE WITHIN ITS OWN EMBAYMENT COASTAL SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DEVELOP MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS TO QUANTIFY THIS IDEAL BAY SHAPE SINCE THE 1940S. AS THE SCENARIO WITH DEPLETING SEDIMENT SUPPLY HAS BECOME A COMMON REALITY ON MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD COASTLINE IN MORE RECENT TIME, SOME COASTAL ENGINEERS HAVE ADVOCATED A RATIONAL APPROACH TO MIMICKING THE STATIC BAY SHAPE FOUND IN NATURE IN ORDER TO MITIGATE BEACH EROSION AS WELL AS FOR COASTAL MANAGEMENT. NOWADAYS, MANY USEFUL APPLICATIONS HAVE EMERGED SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF THE PARABOLIC BAY SHAPE EQUATION (PBSE) DEVELOPED FOR STATIC EQUILIBRIUM PLANFORM (SEP) IN LATE 1980S. THE ADVANCE IN MODERN COMPUTER TECHNOLOGIES AND INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION HAS FURTHER FACILITATED THE EXCHANGE OF KNOWLEDGE AND APPLICATIONS OF THIS STATIC BAY BEACH CONCEPT (SBBC). THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE PROGRESS ON THE RESEARCH IN HBB MADE BY GEOGRAPHERS AND GEOLOGISTS SINCE THE 1940S, TOGETHER WITH THE INVOLVEMENT OF COASTAL ENGINEERS WORKING ON SHORE PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT FROM THE 1960S. AIDED BY SOFTWARE MEPBAY DEVELOPED IN 2003 FOR THE PBSE, SEVERAL PRACTICAL EXAMPLES ARE DEMONSTRATED IN THIS PAPER FOR THE STABILITY VERIFICATION OF NATURAL AND MAN MADE BAY BEACHES, SHORE PROTECTION, MITIGATING DOWNDRIFT EROSION OF A HARBOUR, DESIGN OF RECREATIONAL BAY BEACH, AS WELL AS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT. LIMITATIONS ON AND CLARIFICATIONS FOR ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS BASED ON THE SBBC ARE ALSO DISCUSSED IN THIS PAPER. (C) 2009 PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER B.V.	***

ALGERIA IS KNOWN AS THE COUNTRY MOST SEVERELY THREATENED BY WATER STRESS AND SCARCITY BY EARLY 2020. ONE OF THE IMPORTANT FACTORS EXACERBATING THIS PROBLEM IS THE CONCENTRATION OF THREE QUARTERS OF THE INHABITANTS AND CONSEQUENTLY THE INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES ALONG THE 1200 KM COASTAL ZONE, WHICH HAS LED TO AN INCREASE IN THE POLLUTION OF THE EXISTING WATER RESOURCES. DROUGHTS DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND POLLUTION ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS DESTABILIZING THE EXISTING BALANCE. THEREFORE, THE DESALINATION OF SEA WATER CAN PROVIDE A SOLUTION TO ONE OF THE MOST URGENT AND VITAL AND PROBLEMS, OF BALANCING AND ENHANCING WATER RESOURCES, AS THE WIDE VARIATION OF RAINFALL, FROM MORE THAN 2000 MM/Y IN THE NORTH COASTAL REGION DROPPING TO LESS THAN 100 MM/Y IN THE SOUTHERN SAHARA, SHOULD BE TAKEN IN ACCOUNT. GIVEN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE WILL FOCUS ON THE NEED FOR DESALINATION, THE DESALINATION PROGRAM, AND ALSO THE STRATEGY AND THE VISION OF DESALINATION IN ADDITION TO OTHER NON CONVENTIONAL WATER RESOURCES THAT MIGHT GUARANTEE THE OPTIMUM CONDITIONS FOR INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.	***

CLEARLY THERE IS A NEED FOR TOOLS THAT CAN BE USED IN MITIGATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE INCURRED BY OIL ACCIDENTS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A DYNAMIC MAPPING APPLICATION FOR COMPARING THE ECOLOGICAL VALUE OF THE SHORELINE OF THE GULF OF FINLAND TO GUIDE DECISIONS ON WHERE TO LAY OIL BOOMS AFTER AN OIL SPILL ACCIDENT. THE MAPS WERE REQUIRED TO COMBINE CONSERVATIONAL VALUE OF DIFFERENT SPECIES OCCURRENCES, THE ESTIMATED LEVEL OF OIL EXPOSURE, THE ESTIMATED RECOVERY POTENTIAL OF THE OCCURRENCES FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF OIL BOOMS TO SAFEGUARD THE SPECIES INHABITING THE OCCURRENCES. THE MAPPING WAS TESTED IN REPRESENTATIVE CASES. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE RANKING OF NEIGHBOURING SHORELINE STRECHES CHANGES DEPENDING ON WEATHER CONDITIONS AND ON CHOICES MADE IN DEVELOPING THE SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA. TO THE AUTHORS KNOWLEDGE THIS WORK REPRESENTS A UNIQUE EFFORT IN COMBINING BIOLOGICAL AND GEOSPATIAL EXPERTISE TO PROVIDE DECISION SUPPORT FOR OIL COMBATING. SUCH SUPPORT IS ESSENTIAL SHOULD ECOLOGICAL VALUES TRULY BE INCLUDED IN OIL COMBATING PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT. (C) 2009 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

AMBIENT TOXICITY OF P. PARVUM HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED WITH IN VITRO AND IN VIVO MODELS BECAUSE RELIABLE QUANTITATION OF P. PARVUM TOXINS IN ENVIRONMENTAL MATRICES IS OFTEN PRECLUDED BY A LACK OF AVAILABLE ANALYTICAL STANDARDS. HEMOLYTIC ACTIVITY AND FISH MORTALITY ASSAYS HAVE BEEN USED MOST FREQUENTLY TO CHARACTERIZE TOXIC CONDITIONS; HOWEVER, RELATIVELY FEW IN VIVO STUDIES EMPLOYED STANDARDIZED METHODS. BECAUSE THE RELATIVE SENSITIVITIES OF DIFFERENT TAXA TO P. PARVUM TOXINS IN INLAND WATERS WERE UNDEFINED, WE ASSESSED THE COMPARATIVE TOXICITY OF P. PARVUM FILTRATE FROM A LABORATORY STUDY (20 DEGREES C, 12:12 LIGHT:DARK CYCLE, F/8 MEDIA, 2.4 PSU) TO SEVERAL COMMON STANDARDIZED IN VITRO AND IN VIVO MODELS. AFTER EXPOSURE TO CELL FREE FILTRATE HEMOLYTIC ACTIVITY (1 H EC(50) 13,712 CELLS/ML) AND JUVENILE FISH (PIMEPHALES PROMELAS) SURVIVAL (48 H LC(50) 21,754 CELLS/ML) WERE THE MOST SENSITIVE ASSAY RESPONSES EXAMINED, FOLLOWED BY ROTIFER (BRACHIONUS CALYCIFLORUS) POPULATION GROWTH RATE [48 H NO OBSERVABLE ADVERSE EFFECT LEVELS (NOAEL) 19,072 CELLS/ML] AND CLADOCERAN (DAPHNIA MAGNA) REPRODUCTION (10 DAY NOAEL 47,680 CELLS/ML). GREEN ALGAE (PSEUDOKIRCHNERIELLA SUBCAPITATA) GROWTH (96 H) WAS NOT ADVERSELY AFFECTED BUT WAS INSTEAD SIGNIFICANTLY STIMULATED BY P. PARVUM TOXINS. WE FURTHER PROPOSE AN INITIAL SPECIES SENSITIVITY DISTRIBUTION APPROACH FOR P. PARVUM, WHICH MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. OUR FINDINGS FROM THESE LABORATORY STUDIES INDICATE THAT ALTHOUGH FISH KILLS ARE INCREASINGLY ASSOCIATED WITH P. PARVUM BLOOMS OCCURRING IN INLAND WATERS, FURTHER STUDY IS REQUIRED TO DEFINE THE INFLUENCES OF TOXIN SENSITIVITIES OF PHYTOPLANKTON, ZOOPLANKTON, AND FISH COMMUNITIES ON P.

THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A REGIONAL FLOOD FREQUENCY ANALYSIS AND RECOGNITION OF SPATIAL PATTERNS FOR FLOOD FREQUENCY VARIATIONS IN THE PRD REGION USING THE WELL KNOWN INDEX FLOOD L MOMENTS APPROACH TOGETHER WITH SOME ADVANCED STATISTICAL TEST AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS METHODS. RESULTS INDICATE THAT: (1) THE WHOLE PRD REGION IS DEFINITELY HETEROGENEOUS ACCORDING TO THE HETEROGENEITY TEST AND CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE HOMOGENEOUS REGIONS; (2) THE SPATIAL MAPS FOR ANNUAL MAXIMUM FLOOD STAGE CORRESPONDING TO DIFFERENT RETURN PERIODS IN THE PRD REGION SUGGEST THAT THE FLOOD STAGE DECREASES GRADUALLY FROM THE RIVERINE SYSTEM TO THE TIDE DOMINATED COSTAL AREAS; (3) FROM A REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE, THE SPATIAL PATTERNS OF FLOOD FREQUENCY VARIATIONS DEMONSTRATE THE MOST SERIOUS FLOOD RISK IN THE COASTAL REGION BECAUSE IT IS EXTREMELY PRONE TO THE EMERGING FLOOD HAZARDS, TYPHOONS, STORM SURGES AND WELL EVIDENCED SEA LEVEL RISING. EXCESSIVE RAINFALL IN THE UPSTREAM BASINS WILL LEAD TO MODERATE FLOODS IN THE UPPER AND MIDDLE PRD REGION. THE FLOOD RISKS OF REST PARTS ARE IDENTIFIED AS THE LOWEST IN ENTIRE PRD. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MORE RELIABLE ESTIMATES, THE STATIONARITY AND SERIAL INDEPENDENCE ARE TESTED PRIOR TO FREQUENCY ANALYSIS. THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SPATIAL PATTERNS OF FLOOD FREQUENCY VARIATIONS IS CONDUCTED TO REVEAL THE POTENTIAL INFLUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND INTENSIFIED HUMAN ACTIVITIES. THESE FINDINGS WILL DEFINITELY CONTRIBUTE TO FORMULATING THE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES FOR POLICYMAKERS AND STAKEHOLDERS IN WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AGAINST THE MENACES OF FREQUENTLY EMERGED FLOODS AND WELL EVIDENCED SEA LEVEL RISING.	***

DYNAMIC URBAN EXPANSION MODELS ARE USEFUL TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND THE URBANIZATION PROCESS, PROJECT ITS SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS AND PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION FOR ASSESSING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS OF URBANIZATION. A HYBRID URBAN EXPANSION MODEL (NNSCA MODEL) WAS PROPOSED TO SIMULATE RAPID URBAN GROWTH IN A TYPICAL INDUSTRIAL CITY, DONGYING, CHINA, BY COUPLING A ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK BASED STOCHASTIC CELLULAR AUTOMATA MODEL AND SEVERAL SOCIOECONOMIC INDICTORS, I.E., THE PER CAPITA INCOME OF THE RURAL POPULATION, THE PER CAPITA INCOME OF THE URBAN POPULATION, POPULATION AND GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCTS OF THE CITY. GOOD CONFORMITY BETWEEN SIMULATED AND ACTUAL URBAN PATTERNS SUGGESTED THAT THE NNSCA MODEL WAS ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY SIMULATE HISTORIC URBAN GROWTH AND TO GENERATE REALISTIC URBAN PATTERNS. A SERIES OF SCENARIO ANALYSES SUGGESTED THAT THE EXPANDING URBAN WOULD THREATEN THE ECOSYSTEM HEALTH OF COASTAL WETLANDS IN THE CITY UNLESS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACTIONS ARE TAKEN IN THE FUTURE. THE NNSCA MODEL PROVIDES ABILITIES TO ASSESS FUTURE URBAN GROWTH UNDER VARIOUS PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT SCENARIOS, AND CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO ECOLOGICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS MODELS TO EVALUATE URBANIZATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS.	***

THE CONTAMINATION HAS A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH ERUPTION OF DIARRHOEA, CHOLERA AND TYPHOID WHICH CLAIM THE LIVES OF THE RESIDENTS. MOST OF THE WASTES ARE OF DOMESTIC AND MARKET ORIGIN AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR COMPOST PRODUCTION. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE POSSIBILITY OF COMPOSTING MSW FROM ZANZIBAR MUNICIPALITY AS AN ALTERNATIVE WAY OF SW MANAGEMENT AND ASSESSED THE NUTRIENT CONTENTS OF THE COMPOST FOR APPLICATION IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. TWO MAJOR CLASSES OF SW WERE SELECTED FOR THE STUDY: MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE AND RICE MILLING BY PRODUCTS. THE SAMPLES WERE COMPOSTED AEROBICALLY AND ANAEROBICALLY. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT AEROBIC COMPOSTING REDUCED ABOUT 60% OF THE WASTE VOLUME. THIS VOLUME REDUCTION SUGGESTS THAT COMPOSTING CAN BE A PROMISING SW MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE BY REDUCING THE LARGE DEMAND OF SPACE FOR LANDFILLING. MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE COMPOSTED UNDER ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS PRODUCED COMPOST WITH RELATIVELY HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF DISSOLVED SPECIES THAN THAT PRODUCED UNDER AEROBIC CONDITIONS. THE TRACE METAL CONTENTS WERE HIGHER IN MSW THAN IN RICE MILLING BY PRODUCTS. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE UNMANAGED COMPOST COLLECTED FROM THE DUMPING SITE HAD LOW NUTRIENT CONTENTS AND WAS ENRICHED WITH TRACE METALS. GENERALLY, PHYSICO CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS, NUTRIENTS AND TRACE METAL LEVELS SUGGEST THAT ZANZIBAR MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE CAN PRODUCE HIGH QUALITY COMPOST FOR APPLICATION TO A WIDE RANGE OF SOIL TYPES TO IMPROVE THEIR FERTILITY, UNDER PROPER MANAGEMENT.	***

THESE APPROACHS CONSIST OF A MODEL OF SPECIES CO OCCURRENCE PROBABILITY, A MODEL OF K ENVIRONMENTAL FACTOR PROBABILITY AND A COMPOSITE MODEL. SIMULTANEOUSLY, A CASE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN HSINCHU FISHING PORT OF NORTH WESTERN TAIWAN. BASED ON THE AFOREMENTIONED MODELS, THREE PRIMARY PRODUCER SPECIES, AHNFELTIOPSIS FLABELLIFORMIS, CHONDRUS OCELLATUS AND SARCODIA MONTAGNEANA, WERE CHOSEN AS THE INDICATOR SPECIES WHICH HAD THE HIGHEST CO OCCURRENCE PROBABILITIES AND SHOWED GREATER TOLERANCE TO MORE CRITICAL ENVIRONMENT. IT IS IMPERATIVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE THREE SPECIES UNDER PARTICULAR CO OCCURRING CONDITIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS INFLUENCE THE COMPOSITION OF SESSILE ASSEMBLAGES IN COASTAL WATER. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT FOR THE PURPOSE OF INCREASING BIODIVERSITY, THESE MODELS ARE FEASIBLE TO FIND INDICATOR SPECIES OF ARTIFICIAL STRUCTURES, AND TO HELP MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO DESIGN COASTAL STRUCTURES BASED ON BIOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS. THIS STUDY PROVIDES AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH FOR FURTHER ADVANCED APPLICATION IN THE ARTIFICIAL HABITAT OF COAST MANAGEMENT.	***

THE EFFECT ON THE NATURAL DUNE VEGETATION IS EVIDENT BY A DENSE COVERAGE OF NON NATIVE STINGING NETTLES (URITICA DIOICA), DISPLACING NATIVE FLORA SPECIES, SUCH AS SAND SEDGE (CAREX ARENARIA) AND MARRAM GRASS (AMMOPHILIA ARENARIA), ON THIS INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED CALCAREOUS DUNE SYSTEM. IN TURN, THIS IS AFFECTING CURRENT COASTAL PROCESSES, AS DUNE BUILDING HAS BEEN INTERRUPTED BY THE PRESENCE OF VEGETATION LESS CAPABLE OF TRAPPING SAND THAN NATIVE DUNE SPECIES. RESULTANT DUNE DEFLATION HAS CAUSED THE SHORELINE TO MIGRATE LANDWARDS, EXPOSING THE TOBACCO WASTE, THUS CREATING ERODING CLIFFS (UP TO 3 M HIGH) OF WASTE AND DEPOSITING IT ON THE BEACH. THE NATIONAL TRUST ADVOCATES THE WIDE UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPORTANCE OF SUCH NATURAL COASTAL PROCESSES AND THEREFORE ACCEPTS DUNE ROLLBACK AS A POSITIVE PROCESS IN TOBACCO WASTE MANAGEMENT, RATHER THAN THE COSTLY TOTAL REMOVAL STRATEGY.	***

NEVERTHELESS EROSION ALONG SHORELINES IS BECOMING ONE OF THE GROWING SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS. FOR COASTAL DEFENCE, AN INNOVATIVE COASTAL PROTECTION SYSTEM, THE BMS (BEACH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OR RSA), WAS INSTALLED ALONG A STRETCH OF ITALIAN COAST. THE TECHNIQUE IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE ARTIFICIAL DRAINAGE OF THE BEACH TO KEEP THE WATER SURFACE LEVEL LOW. AFTER SEA WATER DRAINAGE, PUMPS DISCHARGE THE DRAINED WATER BACK TO THE SEA. OUR PROPOSAL IS TO USE THE DRAINED WATER AS AN OPTION TO ITS DISCHARGE INTO THE SEA. THEREFORE A STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT WITH THE AIM TO VERIFY IF THIS PROPOSAL CAN BE ACHIEVABLE. ANALYSES OF BOTH MICROBIAL PARAMETERS, SUCH AS BACTERIAL INDICATORS AND SALMONELLA, AND PHYSICO CHEMICAL PARAMETERS WERE CARRIED OUT FOR THE EVALUATION OF THE HYGIENIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DRAINAGE WATER AT THE OUTLET OF THE SYSTEM. RESULTS SHOWED THAT A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION (1 2 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE) OF THE MICROBIAL LOADS WAS ACHIEVED AFTER THE TRANSPORT OF WATER THROUGH THE SAND AND THE COATED PIPES OF THE SYSTEM THAT WORK AS AN EFFICIENT MECHANISM OF BACTERIAL REMOVAL. TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE OBTAINED RESULTS, THIS NEW SOLUTION FOR THE DEFENCE OF SHORELINES COULD BE USED FOR MAKING A PRODUCTIVE REUSE OF GOOD QUALITY NON CONVENTIONAL WATER, SUCH AS SEA WATER. AREAS SUBJECT TO COASTAL EROSION COULD MAXIMISE BENEFITS DUE TO SUSTAINABLE FORMS OF COASTAL MANAGEMENT WITH PRACTICES OF WATER SAVING AND USE THE DRAINED WATER FOR REPLENISHMENT OF MARINE SWIMMING POOLS, AQUATIC PARKS, AQUARIUMS AND AQUACULTURE POOLS OR FOR THE RE QUALIFICATION OF HUMID ZONES OR FOR CONTRASTING SUBSIDENCE PHENOMENA ALONG THE COASTS.	***

HABITAT PROVIDED BY REEFS PLACED IN AREAS DEVOID OF NATURAL HARD BOTTOM OR STRUCTURE MAY BE COLONIZED BY NIS PROPAGULES DISPERSED FROM NATURAL OR ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES. A NETWORK OF REEF STRUCTURES MAY ALSO CREATE NIS CORRIDORS FOR LINKING PREVIOUSLY UNCONNECTED AREAS. DUE TO ITS LEVEL OF OFFSHORE HABITAT ALTERATION, CHANGING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, VOLUME OF SHIPPING AND BOATING TRAFFIC, AND SUBTROPICAL LOCATION, THE GULF OF MEXICO MAY BE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO NIS INTRODUCTIONS AND HAS A NUMBER OF DOCUMENTED NIS. NON INDIGENOUS OR INVASIVE SPECIES CONCERNS HAVE DELAYED AND INCREASED COSTS FOR SOME RECENT REEF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. THE LINKAGES BETWEEN NIS AND CONSTRUCTED REEFS ARE REVIEWED, AND APPROACHES FOR ANTICIPATING, ASSESSING, AND CONTROLLING INTRODUCTIONS ARE RECOMMENDED. USING BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT NIS RISKS, REEF PLANNERS CAN BEGIN TO EVALUATE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND INCORPORATE RISK MANAGEMENT MEASURES TO REDUCE FUTURE INTRODUCTIONS. PREVENTION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE RISK REDUCTION APPROACH BECAUSE CONTROLLING MARINE NIS AFTER INTRODUCTION IS EXPENSIVE AND OFFERS LIMITED PROBABILITY FOR SUCCESS. (C) 2009 ELSEVIER B.V.

DATA REGARDING TOTAL ANNUAL RAINFALLS AS HIGH AS 4000 MM ARE REGISTERED REGULARLY WITHIN THE BORDER OF TABASCO AND CHIAPAS. THE MOST IMPORTANT WETLANDS OF MEXICO ARE LOCATED HERE ON THE LOW RIVER BASIN OF THE GRIJALVA AND USUMACINTA RIVERS. SINCE ANCIENT TIMES, PEOPLE IN THIS PART OF MEXICO ARE RELATED TO THIS FLOODING SYSTEM IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. A SYSTEM OF DAMS GENERATES MOST OF THE ELECTRICITY POWER USED ON SOUTHERN MEXICO. OIL EXPLOITATION, CATTLE BREEDING AND AGRICULTURE ARE THE MAIN ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR AN IMPORTANT LOSS OF THE NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO STUDY FLOODING CAUSES IN THIS AREA. GEOMORPHOLOGY, CLIMATE, TOPOGRAPHY, HYDROLOGY AND SOIL MAPS WERE CONSTRUCTED. A HISTORICAL REVIEW OF FLOODS, RIVER COURSES, AND LAND USE AS WELL AS AN ANALYSIS OF METEOROLOGICAL DATA WERE PERFORMED. ECOSYSTEM VULNERABILITY WAS EVALUATED. RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LOSS OF 90% OF THE ORIGINAL BIODIVERSITY OF TROPICAL FOREST DUE MAINLY TO FARMING AND POOR CATTLE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE, UNPLANNED URBAN GROWTH AND OIL EXPLOITATION INFRASTRUCTURE HAS CAUSED AN IMPORTANT IMPACT ESPECIALLY ON THE HYDRODYNAMICS AND COASTAL AREAS. EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS WITH MORE THAN 200 MM IN 24 HOURS ARE MORE COMMON EACH YEAR. THE AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF FLOODS TODAY HAS INCREASED AND PUT AT RISK A GREAT NUMBER OF THE POPULATION. CLIMATE CHANGE WOULD INCREASE THE POSSIBILITY OF FLOODS. RESULTS PROPOSE CONSERVATION POLICIES TO PROTECT OR RECOVER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES.	***

WATER DISCHARGE, TEMPERATURE, PH, DISSOLVED OXYGEN (DO) AND ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY (EC) WERE MEASURED IN SITU USING APPROPRIATE EQUIPMENT. THE COLLECTED WATER SAMPLES WERE ANALYZED IN THE LABORATORY FOR THE DETERMINATION OF NITRATE, NITRITE AND AMMONIUM NITROGEN, TOTAL KJELDALH NITROGEN (TKN), ORTHOPHOSPHATE (OP), TOTAL PHOSPHORUS (TP), COD, AND BOD. AGRICULTURAL DIFFUSE SOURCES PROVIDED THE MAJOR SOURCE OF NITRATE NITROGEN LOADS DURING THE WET PERIOD. DURING THE DRY PERIOD (FROM JUNE TO OCTOBER), THE MAJOR NUTRIENT (N, P) AND COD, BOD SOURCES WERE POINT SOURCES. THE TROPHIC STATUS OF VOSVOZIS RIVER DURING THE MONITORING PERIOD WAS DETERMINED AS EUTROPHIC, BASED ON DODDS CLASSIFICATION SCHEME. MOREOVER, THE SWAT MODEL WAS USED TO SIMULATE HYDROGRAPHS AND NUTRIENT LOADS. SWAT WAS VALIDATED WITH THE MEASURED DATA. PREDICTED HYDROGRAPHS AND POLLUTOGRAPHS WERE PLOTTED AGAINST OBSERVED VALUES AND SHOWED GOOD AGREEMENT. THE VALIDATED MODEL WAS USED TO TEST EIGHT ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS CONCERNING DIFFERENT CROPPING MANAGEMENT APPROACHES. THE RESULTS OF THESE SCENARIOS INDICATE THAT NONPOINT SOURCE POLLUTION IS THE PREVAILING TYPE OF POLLUTION IN THE STUDY AREA.

AN INTEGRATED LINEAR DETERMINISTIC OPTIMIZATION MODEL IS APPLIED TO BEIRUT, LEBANON, TO DETERMINE THE MINIMUM COST CONFIGURATION OF FUTURE WATER SUPPLY, WASTEWATER DISPOSAL, AND REUSE OPTIONS FOR A SEMIARID COASTAL CITY. PREVIOUS URBAN WATER SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION MODELS CONSIDERED ONLY A SINGLE QUALITY OF POTABLE WATER AND WERE THUS UNABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF RECLAIMED WATER AMONG ALL VIABLE OPTIONS FOR WATER SUPPLY. TWO INNOVATIONS OF OUR WORK INCLUDE INCORPORATION OF THE ENTIRE ANTHROPOGENIC WATER CYCLE INCLUDING INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN SUPPLY, DEMAND, DISPOSAL, AND REUSE AND MODELING OF THE SUITABILITY OF NONPOTABLE AND POTABLE QUALITIES OF WATER FOR EACH DEMAND SECTOR. THE OPTIMIZATION MODEL YIELDS SURPRISING INSIGHTS. FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER FULL USE OF INEXPENSIVE CONVENTIONAL SOURCES, NONPOTABLE DIRECT REUSE APPEARS TO BE BEIRUTS MOST COST EFFECTIVE OPTION FOR SUPPLY OF ITS URBAN NONPOTABLE AND IRRIGATION DEMANDS. OUR WORK HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF MODELING THE UTILITY OF MULTIPLE QUALITIES OF WATER IN MODERN WATER SUPPLY PLANNING.	***

	GRRRU	BECKER,WAYNE W								SALUTARY TECHNOLOGY INC,UNITED STATES OF AMERICA								A COMMUNITY SAFETY SYSTEM BALANCING RISK, COST AND FREEDOM	2010	OCEANS			7							1	SIN CORRESPONDIG	THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT A RANGE OF PROPOSED GOVERNMENT ACTIONS CAN AND OFTEN SHOULD BE EVALUATED IN A WAY THAT INCLUDES THEIR EFFECTS ON PERSONAL FREEDOMS. THIS IS ILLUSTRATED IN THE CASE OF EFFORTS DIRECTED TOWARD RECREATIONAL BOATING SAFETY IN THE UNITED STATES, AND EVOLVES FROM A MULTI YEAR STUDY TO RECOMMEND THE COMPOSITION OF AN APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR THAT SUBJECT. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM SEEKS TO DETERMINE BEST SAFETY/SECURITY DECISIONS, IN A WAY THAT REFLECTS COMMUNITY ROLES, VALUES AND RESOURCES, AND THAT INCLUDES EFFECTS ON FREEDOM IN THE CALCULUS OF COSTS AND BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS. ITS EXTENSION TO REGIONAL COASTAL AND MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING IS DISCUSSED. THERE WERE 738 REPORTED DEATHS IN U. S. RECREATIONAL BOATING ACCIDENTS IN 2009. THERE IS A COMMUNITY INTERESTED IN PREVENTING BOATING ACCIDENTS THAT INCLUDES THE U. S. COAST GUARD, AGENCIES OF EACH OF THE STATES AND MANY LOCALITIES, VARIOUS NON PROFITS AND INTEREST GROUPS, AND, OF COURSE, BOATERS THEMSELVES. THE ETHOS OF BOATING AND RELATED LAW ARE SUCH THAT PROPONENTS FOR IMPOSED SAFETY MEASURES, INCLUDING BOAT AND OPERATOR REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS, MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE DISCRETIONARY NATURE OF THIS ACTIVITY. THUS, THE QUESTION, FAMILIAR IN U. S. PUBLIC DECISION MAKING, IS HOW BEST TO BALANCE AND APPORTION THE RISKS, COSTS AND CHANGES IN PARTICIPANT ENJOYMENT OR FREEDOM TO ACT CONNECTED WITH CHOICES THAT MIGHT BE MADE TO ENHANCE SAFETY. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A PROPOSED RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THE DEVELOPMENT OF WHICH TOOK PLACE OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD BY A VARIED GROUP OF PARTICIPANTS UNDER A GRANT TO THE MARINE SAFETY FOUNDATION. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM RECOGNIZES THAT ANY POLICY ANALYSIS MUST CONSIDER MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES FOR DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. IT IS INTENTIONAL IN INCORPORATING THE VIEWS, VALUES AND RESOURCES OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN ITS ANALYSES OF PROPOSALS FOR SAFETY ACTIONS. IT IS ALSO INTENTIONAL ABOUT INCORPORATING FREEDOM AS A VALUE IN PLAY, (ALONG WITH THE COSTS TO DIFFERENT PARTIES AND CHANGES IN RISK/SAFETY THAT MIGHT RESULT,) IN THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF ITS CHOICES FOR SAFETY INTERVENTIONS. THUS, THESE RISK MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES COMPRISE A STRUCTURE OF VALUES REFLECTING U. S. POLITICAL OUTLOOK, GROUP RELATIONAL ELEMENTS, ANALYTICAL PROCESSES AND CRITICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ITS SUBJECT. AS PRESENTED IN ITS FINAL REPORT, PUBLISHED LAST WINTER, IT INCLUDES A COMPUTER ENABLED PROCESS, (DEVELOPED BY PARTICIPANTS FROM INNOVATIVE DECISIONS, INC.,) TO WEIGH CHANGES IN RISK, COST AND FREEDOM CONNECTED WITH PROPOSED SAFETY OPTIONS. THIS MODEL FOR AN INTEGRATING FRAMEWORK INCORPORATES PROBABILISTIC RISK ANALYSIS, VALUE FOCUSED THINKING FOR EXAMINING CRITICAL TRADEOFFS USING MULTI ATTRIBUTE UTILITY ANALYSIS, AND ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES ACROSS MULTIPLE STAKE HOLDERS AND BOATING CLASSES. AN IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE HUMAN ERROR CAUSES OF FATAL BOATING ACCIDENTS WAS ALSO PERFORMED DURING THE COURSE OF THIS PROJECT. IT POINTS OUT THE MOST SERIOUS ACCIDENT CAUSES, WHICH ARE SEEN TO VARY ACROSS DIFFERENT BOAT TYPES, AND PROVIDES ANOTHER BASIS FOR IDENTIFYING NEEDED SAFETY INTERVENTIONS. THE OUTLOOK AND APPROACH DEVELOPED IN THE COURSE OF THIS PROJECT ARE USEFUL IN A WIDE RANGE OF GOVERNMENT DECISIONS WHERE ACTIONS INTENDED TO PROVIDE SECURITY OR OTHER ASPECTS OF THE GREATER GOOD DEMAND A BALANCE OF RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS AMONG MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS WITH DIFFERENT VALUES, HELPING TO RATIONALIZE THE ESSENTIAL GIVE AND TAKE OF OUR POLITICAL PROCESS.(1)	***

NDBC AND GOMOOS COLLABORATED ON A PROJECT TO TRANSMIT METEOROLOGICAL AND OCEANOGRAPHIC DATA FROM THE GOMOOS BUOYS TO NDBC IN REAL TIME. NDBCS DATA QUALITY CONTROL, DATA FORMAT, AND COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES TO WERE THEN USED TO TRANSMIT THE DATA TO THE NWS TELECOMMUNICATIONS GATEWAY (NWSTG), WHICH DISSEMINATED THE DATA TO THE WEATHER FORECAST OFFICES (WFOS) IN THE REGION. AS IOOS HAS MATURED AND REGIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (RAS) HAVE DEVELOPED, NDBC HAS BEEN A PARTNER. NDBC SHARES OCEAN OBSERVATION EXPERTISE, DEVELOPS DATA MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES AND QUALITY CONTROL ALGORITHMS, AND KEEPS THE RAS AND IOOS INFORMED BY PARTICIPATING IN REGIONAL ASSOCIATION MEETINGS AND WORKSHOPS. USING A SCALABLE SYSTEM THAT IS ABLE TO RECEIVE INCREASING NUMBERS OF OBSERVATIONS, WHILE MAINTAINING QUALITY CONTROL, NDBC HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF PARTNER DATA PROVIDERS TO MORE THAN 40 AND THE NUMBER OF PARTNER PLATFORMS TO MORE THAN 600. MANY OF THE PROVIDERS ARE MEMBERS OF RAS AND OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEMS (OOSS). THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS HANDLED BY NDBC WILL APPROACH 10 MILLION A YEAR BY THE END OF 2010. AS NDBC AND PARTNER DATA ARE QUALITY CONTROLLED AT THE GATEWAY, ANY DATA THAT DO NOT MEET THE STRINGENT QUALITY CONTROL ALGORITHMS ARE AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGNED QUALITY FLAGS. THE FLAGGED DATA ARE TRANSMITTED TO NDBC, WHERE ANALYSTS RE EXAMINE THE DATA. NDBC HAS ALSO BEEN INVOLVED IN THE IOOS EFFORT TO ESTABLISH THE TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, STANDARDS, AND PROTOCOLS NEEDED TO IMPROVE DELIVERY OF OCEAN DATA THROUGH THE DATA INTEGRATION FORMAT (DIF). NDBC, ALONG WITH NOAAS CENTER FOR OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHIC PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (CO OPS) PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. SERVICES INCLUDE THE NDBC SENSOR OBSERVATION SERVICE (SOS), WHICH PROVIDES OCEAN TEMPERATURES, SALINITIES, CURRENTS, WAVES, AND WINDS FROM NDBC COASTAL BUOYS, IOOS REGIONAL COASTAL OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEMS, AND TAO MOORINGS. IN ADDITION TO THESE DATA, HIGH FREQUENCY RADAR DERIVED COASTAL SURFACE CURRENTS ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE NDBC THREDDS DATA SERVER. A NEW PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN NOAAS NATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHIC DATA CENTER (NODC) AND NDBC WILL LEAD TO THE CAPABILITY TO PRESERVE ALL OF NDBCS MARINE DATASETS TO MEET THE STANDARDS FOR CLIMATE OBSERVATION REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED BY NOAA AND THE GLOBAL CLIMATE OBSERVATION SYSTEM (GCOS). TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NEW TECHNIQUES USING OCEAN GEOSPATIAL CONSORTIUM (OGC) INC. STANDARDS AND THE SOS DESCRIBED ABOVE AND FUNDED BY NOAAS IOOS PROGRAM, WILL ENABLE A NEW DEGREE OF INTEROPERABILITY WITHIN AND BETWEEN NDBC AND NODC AND PROPERLY ARCHIVE ALL NDBC PARTNER OBSERVATIONS.	***

A KEY OBJECTIVE FOR NANOOS IS TO PROVIDE DATA AND USER DEFINED PRODUCTS TO A DIVERSE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS IN A TIMELY FASHION, AND AT SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR NEEDS. TO THIS END, NANOOS DEVELOPED THE NANOOS VISUALIZATION SYSTEM (NVS), WHICH AGGREGATES, DISPLAYS AND SERVES METEOROLOGICAL AND OCEANOGRAPHIC DATA, DERIVED FROM BUOYS, GLIDERS, TIDE GAUGES, HF RADAR, METEOROLOGICAL STATIONS AND SATELLITES, AS WELL AS MODEL FORECAST INFORMATION IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT PRESENTS END USERS WITH A RICH, INFORMATIVE AND USER FRIENDLY EXPERIENCE. FIRST RELEASED IN NOVEMBER 2009, NVS HAS ALREADY UNDERGONE SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT UPDATES. WHILE ITS ORIGINAL FOCUS AND CONTINUED STRENGTH IS ON NEAR REAL TIME (NRT) OBSERVATIONS FROM STATIONARY PLATFORMS (BUOYS, COASTAL STATIONS, ETC.), IT HAS EVOLVED TO INCLUDE OTHER TYPES OF OBSERVATIONS AS WELL AS FORECAST INFORMATION. NVS INTEGRATES DATA FROM A WIDE DIVERSITY OF PROVIDERS ACROSS THE REGION, RANGING FROM COUNTY AGENCIES, PRIVATE INDUSTRY AND REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS, TO CORE IOOS FEDERAL PROGRAMS, AND STATE AGENCIES AND ACADEMIC GROUPS THAT ARE PRINCIPAL PARTNERS IN NANOOS DATA MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNICATION (DMAC) EFFORTS. REGIONAL AND NATIONAL FEEDBACK CONFIRMS THAT NVS HAS BEEN WELL RECEIVED BY OCEAN OBSERVING AND STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITIES ALIKE. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES, IN DETAIL, NVS 2.0, WHICH WAS RELEASED IN AUGUST 2010. IN PARTICULAR, WE PROVIDE AN IN DEPTH LOOK AT THE DATABASE SCHEMA, METADATA, DATA HARVESTING, AND COMPONENT COMMUNICATION. IN ADDITION, WE DISCUSS THE NVS DATA MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNICATION APPROACH IN THE CONTEXT OF THE IOOS DMAC INTEROPERABILITY AND STANDARDS BASED EFFORTS, HIGHLIGHTING THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF APPLICATION FOCUSED VS.

THE USE OF MARINE AND HYDROKINETIC (MHK) DEVICES TO HARNESS THE POWER OF WAVE AND TIDAL ENERGY COULD CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TOWARD MEETING FEDERAL AND STATE MANDATED RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS WHILE SUPPLYING A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF CLEAN ENERGY TO COASTAL COMMUNITIES. LOCATIONS ALONG THE EASTERN AND WESTERN COASTS OF THE UNITED STATES BETWEEN 40 AND 70 NORTH LATITUDE ARE IDEAL FOR MHK DEPLOYMENT, AND RECENT ESTIMATES OF WAVE AND CURRENT ENERGY RESOURCE POTENTIAL IN THE US SUGGEST THAT UP TO 400 TERAWATT HOURS COULD BE GENERATED, REPRESENTING ABOUT 10% OF NATIONAL ENERGY DEMAND. BECAUSE ENERGY DERIVED FROM WAVE AND TIDAL DEVICES IS HIGHLY PREDICTABLE, THEIR INCLUSION IN OUR ENERGY PORTFOLIO COULD HELP BALANCE AVAILABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY PRODUCTION, INCLUDING HYDROELECTRIC, COAL, NUCLEAR, WIND, SOLAR, GEOTHERMAL, AND OTHERS. AS AN EMERGING INDUSTRY, MHK ENERGY DEVELOPERS FACE MANY CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SITING, PERMITTING, CONSTRUCTION, AND OPERATION OF PILOT AND COMMERCIAL SCALE FACILITIES. AS THE INDUSTRY PROGRESSES, IT WILL BE NECESSARY NOT ONLY TO SECURE FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND DEVELOP ROBUST TECHNOLOGIES CAPABLE OF EFFICIENT, CONTINUED OPERATION IN HARSH ENVIRONMENTS, BUT ALSO TO IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE MONITORING PROGRAMS TO EVALUATE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF DEVICE OPERATION AND ASSURE RESOURCE AGENCIES AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ARE UNDERSTOOD AND CAN BE ADDRESSED. AT THIS TIME, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF MHK ENERGY GENERATION AT PILOT OR FULL SCALE OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS. POTENTIAL EFFECTS COULD INCLUDE CHANGES TO AQUATIC SPECIES BEHAVIOR FROM EXPOSURE TO ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS OR OPERATIONAL NOISE; PHYSICAL INTERACTION OF MARINE MAMMALS, FISH, AND INVERTEBRATES WITH OPERATING DEVICES OR MOORING CABLES; OR CHANGES TO BEACH CHARACTERISTICS AND WATER QUALITY FROM LONG TERM DEPLOYMENT OF DEVICES IN COASTAL LOCATIONS. THIS LACK OF KNOWLEDGE CREATES A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY THAT AFFECTS THE ACTIONS OF REGULATORY AGENCIES, INFLUENCES THE OPINIONS AND CONCERNS OF STAKEHOLDER GROUPS, AFFECTS THE COMMITMENT OF ENERGY PROJECT DEVELOPERS AND INVESTORS, AND ULTIMATELY, THE SOLVENCY OF THE INDUSTRY. TO ADDRESS THE COMPLEXITY OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH MHK ENERGY, PNNL HAS RECEIVED SUPPORT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY WATERPOWER PROGRAM TO DEVELOP RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THAT DRAWS ON THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INDUSTRY, REGULATORS, AND STAKEHOLDERS. INITIAL RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON 1) THE DEVELOPMENT OF A KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT DATABASE AND RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL RISK EVALUATION SYSTEM, 2) THE USE OF HYDRODYNAMIC MODELS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF ENERGY REMOVAL ON COASTAL SYSTEMS, 3) THE DEVELOPMENT OF LABORATORY AND MESOCOSM EXPERIMENTS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF EMF AND NOISE ON REPRESENTATIVE MARINE AND ESTUARINE SPECIES, AND 4) COLLABORATIVE INTERACTION WITH REGULATORS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO FACILITATE OCEAN ENERGY DEVICES, INCLUDING PARTICIPATION IN COASTAL AND MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING ACTIVITIES. IN THIS PAPER, WE DESCRIBE OUR APPROACH FOR INITIAL LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF EMFS ON AQUATIC RESOURCES. TESTING WILL BE CONDUCTED ON SPECIES THAT ARE A) EASILY PROCURED AND CULTURED, B) ECOLOGICALLY, COMMERCIALLY, RECREATIONALLY OR CULTURALLY VALUABLE, AND C) REASONABLE SURROGATES FOR THREATENED OR ENDANGERED SPECIES. BIOLOGICAL ENDPOINTS OF INTEREST ARE THOSE THAT PROVIDE COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF MAGNETIC FIELD DETECTION AND HAVE A NEXUS TO INDIVIDUAL, COMMUNITY, OR POPULATION LEVEL EFFECTS. THROUGH LABORATORY, MESOCOSM, AND LIMITED FIELD TESTING, WE HOPE TO REDUCE THE UNCERTAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF OCEAN ENERGY RESOURCES, AND GAIN REGULATORY AND STAKEHOLDER ACCEPTANCE. WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE BEST APPROACH FOR MOVING THE SCIENCE FORWARD AND PROVIDES THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCCESSFULLY APPLYING THIS TECHNOLOGY TOWARD MEETING OUR COUNTRYS RENEWABLE ENERGY NEEDS. DURING THE PROJECT, THE TEAM WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH TWO OTHER NATIONAL LABORATORIES (SANDIA AND OAK RIDGE), THE NORTHWEST NATIONAL MARINE RENEWABLE ENERGY CENTER AT UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON AND OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY, AND PACIFIC ENERGY VENTURES.	***

IOOS IS A TOOL THAT WILL ENABLE THE NATION TO TRACK, PREDICT, MANAGE, AND ADAPT TO CHANGES IN OUR MARINE ENVIRONMENT AND DELIVER CRITICAL INFORMATION TO DECISION MAKERS TO IMPROVE SAFETY, ENHANCE OUR ECONOMY, AND PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT. IOOS PROVIDES A MAJOR SHIFT IN THE APPROACH TO OCEAN OBSERVING BY DRAWING TOGETHER THE VAST NETWORK OF DISPARATE FEDERAL AND NON FEDERAL OBSERVING SYSTEMS TO PRODUCE A COHESIVE SUITE OF DATA, INFORMATION, AND PRODUCTS ON A SUFFICIENT GEOGRAPHIC AND TEMPORAL SCALE TO SUPPORT DECISION MAKING. AS THE SYSTEM MATURES, IOOS IS EXPECTED TO ADVANCE BEYOND ITS CURRENT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT APPLICATIONS TOWARD AN INSTRUMENT OF POLICY AND GOVERNANCE. CURRENT EFFORTS ONLY SCRATCH THE SURFACE OF WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT OUR OCEANS AND COASTS IN ORDER TO FULLY ASSESS THEIR IMPACT ON COMMERCE AND TRANSPORTATION, WEATHER AND CLIMATE, AND ECOSYSTEMS. TWO INTERDEPENDENT COMPONENTS CONSTITUTE THE U.S. IOOS: (1) THE GLOBAL OCEAN COMPONENT, AND (2) THE COASTAL COMPONENT. THE STRENGTH OF IOOS IS IN ITS PARTNERSHIPS. STARTING WITH THE FEDERAL AGENCIES, THE PARTNERSHIPS EXTEND INTERNATIONALLY FOR THE GLOBAL COMPONENT AND TO THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR THE COASTAL COMPONENT. THE COASTAL COMPONENT INCLUDES THE NATIONAL SET OF OBSERVATIONS FOR THE U.S. OCEAN, COASTS AND GREAT LAKES, A NETWORK OF REGIONAL ASSOCIATIONS THAT ARE ESTABLISHING REGIONAL COASTAL OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEMS (RCOOS) AND THE ALLIANCE FOR COASTAL TECHNOLOGIES (ACT). ACT IS COMPRISED OF MULTIPLE INSTITUTIONS THAT PROVIDE SENSOR VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION. THE U. S.

THE NEED FOR SEDIMENT CONTROL IS GAINING IMPORTANCE IN THIS CHALLENGING TIME, ESPECIALLY IN REGIONS WHERE EXTENSIVE DREDGING, RECLAMATION, NEARSHORE AND COASTAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE BEING CARRIED OUT. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE THE SOURCE OF HUGE AMOUNT OF SEDIMENT FLOWING INTO THE WATER AND MARINE ENVIRONMENT AND MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE WELL BEING OF EXISTING MARINE ECOLOGY, HABITAT AND ENVIRONMENT SUCH AS THOSE FOR CORAL REEFS. MARINE ANIMALS, ETC. BESIDE APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO CONTROL THE GENERATION OF SEDIMENT, THE ONLY VIABLE MEANS APPEARS TO BE INSTALLATION OF SILT SCREEN TO CONTAIN AND CONTROL THE SPREADING OF SEDIMENT IN OPEN WATER., SILT SCREEN INSTALLATION, BEING ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, HAS BEEN USED EXTENSIVELY IN MANY COUNTRIES TO IMPROVE AND ACHIEVE SEDIMENT RETENTION AND SEDIMENTATION. IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT, SILT SCREENS REPRESENT BOTH A BARRIER TO IMPROVE SEDIMENTATION AND A MEAN OF PARTICLES RETENTION. DESPITE ITS POPULAR APPLICATION, THE EFFICIENCY OF A SILT SCREEN IS INDEED SUBJECTIVE AT BEST. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SILT SCREENS AS A METHOD OF TURBIDITY CONTROL IS HIGHLY INFLUENCED BY VARIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS THE SITE CHARACTERISTICS, SEDIMENT PROPERTIES, SCREEN CONFIGURATION, ETC. IN MARINE PROJECTS INVOLVING DEPLOYMENT OF SILT SCREENS, AND AS PART OF THE ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT PROCESS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONDUCT REGULAR SEDIMENT CONTROL/MONITORING IN ADDITION TO APPROPRIATE SELECTION OF THE TYPES OF SILT SCREEN AND DECIDING ON THE PROPER INSTALLATION METHOD DURING THE PLANNING STAGE. THE PLANNING PROCESS OF A SILT SCREEN SYSTEM REQUIRES CAREFUL DESIGN, INSTALLATION AND MONITORING PROCESS, STARTING FRONT UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF THE AREA WHERE SILT SCREEN IS INTENDED TO HE INSTALLED TO SELECTION OF PARAMETERS AND CRITERIA USED FOR MONITORING. THERE ARE CERTAIN SPECIFIC STEPS/PROCEDURES, USUALLY RECOMMENDED BY SILT SCREEN PROVIDERS, AND COULD BE ADOPTED TO ENSURE THE SUITABILITY OF THE SILT SCREEN FOR CERTAIN SITES. THESE RECOMMENDED APPROACHES, THOUGH DIFFER SOMEWHAT FROM ONE PROVIDER TO ANOTHER, DO GIVE DUE CONSIDERATION TO THE FLOW FIELD, HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES OF THE SILT SCREEN AND SEDIMENT CHARACTERISTICS. THESE PROCESSES ARE ILLUSTRATED WITH APPLICATION EXAMPLES IN SINGAPORE, KOREA AND HONG KONG.	***

THE METHOD COULD BE USED ON THE AREAS WHERE SHIP TRAFFIC MONITORING IS IMPLEMENTED. NOWADAYS THE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM (AIS) COULD BE USE FOR THIS PURPOSE. TO DEVELOP SAFETY MANAGEMENT METHOD IT IS NECESSARY TO CREATE MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF NAVIGATIONAL SAFETY. THE MODEL IS NEEDED TO PREDICT HOW THE CHANGES MADE IN TRAFFIC OR NAVIGATIONAL MARKINGS WILL INFLUENCE THE SAFETY OF NAVIGATION. THE TRAFFIC MONITORING WILL DELIVER ALL NECESSARY DATA ABOUT INCIDENTS (NEAR MISSES) WHICH COULD BE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF ACCIDENTS. USUALLY THE NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ASSESS THE RISK ON ITS BASIS, ESPECIALLY WHEN SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION IS NECESSARY TO BE CONSIDERED.

MOST CITIES HAVE TO MANAGE AT LEAST TWO OF THESE FLOODING TYPES. AT THE SAME TIME, FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES HAVE CHANGED STEP BY STEP. INDEED, DESPITE EFFORTS MADE TO MAINTAIN THE FLOOD DEFENSE ASSETS WELL, WE OFTEN OBSERVE FAILURES LEADING TO FINALLY INCREASE FLOOD RISK IN PROTECTED AREAS DURING MAJOR FLOOD EVENTS. MOREOVER, FLOOD FORECASTING MODELS, ALTHOUGH THEY BENEFIT FROM CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENTS, REMAIN PARTLY INACCURATE DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES POPULATED ALL ALONG DATA CALCULATION PROCESSES. THIS MEANS CITIES CANNOT CONTINUE TO MANAGE FLOOD RISK ONLY BY THE USE OF FLOOD DEFENSES: SUSTAINABLE OPTIONS HAVE TO BE DESIGNED TO BETTER MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF FLOODING IN URBAN AREA AND IN A LONG TERM STRATEGY. SEVERAL EUROPEAN CITIES HAVE SUFFERED RECENT FLOODING EVENTS. IT WAS THE CASE FOR EXAMPLE IN 2007 IN UNITED KINGDOM. DURING THIS PERIOD, MAJOR EVENTS CAME FROM EXTREME RAINFALL AND IT APPEARS THAT PLUVIAL FLOOD RISK HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENT EVENTS. IN THIS CONTEXT, FLOOD RISK CAN APPEAR ON EVERY TERRITORY: CITIES HAVE TO DEVELOP SOME METHODS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THIS NEW DEAL, OPTIONS TO ACHIEVE URBAN FLOOD RESILIENCE.

HOWEVER, SINCE 1960 UNTIL TODAY, WATER CONSUMPTION HAS INCREASED DUE TO A PROFOUND ECONOMIC, DEMOGRAPHIC AND LANDSCAPE TRANSFORMATION. STATISTICAL CONFIRMATION OF THIS CHANGE IS VERIFIED BY THE VALUE REACHED BY THE USE INDICATORS: PARTICIPATION IN THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT, EMPLOYMENT GENERATED, DISPOSABLE HOUSEHOLD INCOME, POPULATION GROWTH AND CONCENTRATION. THE NEW ECONOMIC TREND HAS INCREASED THE ALLOCATION OF WATER RESOURCES TO ENSURE THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE TERRITORY. THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE OF TAJO SEGURA IS THAT WHICH ENSURES URBAN SUPPLY AND PRODUCTION OF THE IRRIGATED AREA. OVERCOMING WATER SHORTAGES INVOLVES CONVERTING THE RISK OR BOTTLENECKS INTO A GREAT PRODUCTIVE OPPORTUNITY EMBODIED IN A GROWING URBAN/TOURIST IMPACT, WHICH REDUCES THE IRRIGATED AREA BY COMPETING FOR WATER. THIS DYNAMIC URBAN RESIDENTIAL PROCESS OF EXPANSION PENETRATES FROM THE COAST TO THE INLAND MUNICIPALITIES BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF CHEAP LAND AND URBAN PLANNING FLEXIBILITY. AS THE PROSPERITY OF THIS AREA OF ALICANTE WILL ALWAYS BE LINKED TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF WATER, WATER CONFLICTS NEED TO BE RESOLVED IN ORDER TO AVOID INCREASED COMPETITION WITH OTHER USES OF THE LAND. FOR THIS REASON, THE AIM OF THIS WORK IS TO UNDERSTAND AND STUDY THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE TERRITORIAL MODEL AS WELL AS TO OFFER A DIAGNOSIS OF THE DEFICITS, ADVANTAGES AND POTENTIAL FOR BETTER MANAGEMENT OF LAND AND WATER WITHOUT AFFECTING THE ENVIRONMENT.	***

CHINA INBOUND TOURISM PHENOMENON CAN ALSO BE TAKEN AS REGIONALIZED VARIABLE AS WELL, ACCORDING TO ITS RANDOM, STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS. YET THE RESEARCH EXISTING ABOUT IT PAID MORE ATTENTION TO THE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN INDIVIDUAL AND MICROSCOPIC WAYS, RATHER THAN THE MACROSCOPIC, TOTALISTIC, RELATIVE, DYNAMIC CHARACTERS AND DIVERGENCE OF INBOUND TOURISM. THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO INTRODUCE GEOSTATISTICS INTO INBOUND TOURISM RESEARCH AFTER INTERPRETING THE NECESSITY AND FEASIBILITY, AND USES KRIGING METHOD TO ANALYZE SCALES OF INBOUND TOURISTS OF 321 PREFECTURE LEVEL CITIES FROM 2003 TO 2007. BY COMPARING THE FIVE SEMIVARIOGRAMS AND CONTOUR MAPS OF SCALES OF INBOUND TOURISTS, WE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT PEARL RIVER DELTA REGION, YANGZI RIVER DELTA REGION AND BEIJING TIANJIN TANGSHAN REGION HAVE BEEN THE THREE CENTRALIZED AREAS AND DIFFUSION SOURCES OF CHINA INBOUND TOURISM, WHILE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MODES, DIRECTIONS AND ROUTES OF DIFFUSION. THE POLE DIFFUSION HAS BEEN ALTERING TO POLE AXIS DIFFUSION GRADUALLY. MEANWHILE, THE GAP OF INBOUND TOURISM SCALES IN EASTERN COASTAL REGIONS OF CHINA HAS BEEN REDUCING AND THE HOMOGENEITY INCREASING. GUANGXI AND YUNNAN, WHICH HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING RAPIDLY IN RECENT YEARS, TOGETHER WITH SICHUAN AND SHANXI CONSTITUTE THE SUB HIGHLANDS OF INBOUND TOURISM, WHILE THE TOURISM SINKING DOWNFALL OF CENTRAL CHINA HAS BEEN MORE APPARENT. THIS PAPER NOT ONLY DISPLAYS THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF CHINA INBOUND TOURISM, GIVES ADVICE TO THE PLANNING AND TACTICS OF REGIONAL INBOUND TOURISM DEVELOPMENT, BUT ALSO EXPANDS THE APPLICABLE SCOPE OF GEOSTATISTICS AND MAKES CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DIVERSITY OF TOURISM RESEARCH METHODS.	***

MANGROVES PROVIDE A VARIETY OF ECOLOGICAL SERVICES FOR HUMAN BEINGS, SUCH AS THE PROTECTION OF COASTS FROM TYPHOON DAMAGE, POLLUTANT ABSORPTION, AND WATER PURIFICATION. GUANGDONG PROVINCE, USED TO LOCATE HALF OF MANGROVE WETLANDS IN CHINA, HAS WITNESSED THE RAPID DECREASE OF THE MANGROVE WETLAND SINCE REFORM AND OPENING UP IN LATE 1970S. REMOTE SENSING CAN BE CONVENIENTLY USED FOR THE INVENTORY OF MANGROVE FORESTS BECAUSE FIELD INVESTIGATION IS VERY DIFFICULT TO CARRY OUT. MULTI TEMPORAL REMOTE SENSING IMAGES CAN ALSO USED TO GENERATE A LONG TERM SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND CHANGE DETECTION OF NATURE RESOURCE OR LAND COVERS.

THE NSGA II ALGORITHM IS ALSO MODIFIED TO ACCOMMODATE INITIAL SOLUTION GENERATION USING THE LATIN HYPERCUBE SAMPLING FOR UNIFORM SAMPLING IN BOUND SPACE. THESE INITIAL SOLUTIONS ARE USEFUL TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM. ONE IMPORTANT ISSUE IN DEVELOPING MANAGEMENT MODELS FOR COASTAL AQUIFERS INCORPORATING THE DENSITY DEPENDENT FLOW AND TRANSPORT PROCESSES IS THE COMPUTATIONAL FEASIBILITY. A FEW VARIATIONS OF THE MANAGEMENT MODEL ARE ALSO EVALUATED TO TEST THE POTENTIAL FOR IMPROVING THE COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY. THE VARIATIONS IN THE FORMULATION OF MANAGEMENT MODELS INCLUDE: DIRECT LINKING OF NUMERICAL SIMULATION MODEL, INTRODUCING META MODELS [IN THIS STUDY ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN)] IN PLACE OF ORIGINAL NUMERICAL SIMULATION MODEL, USING PARTIALLY TRAINED META MODEL AS A SCREENING MODEL FOR SPECIFYING INITIAL SOLUTIONS FOR THE NUMERICAL SIMULATION MODEL LINKED OPTIMIZATION MODEL. THE DEVELOPED MODELS ARE CAPABLE OF OBTAINING THE NONDOMINATED FRONT OF THE MULTIOBJECTIVE MANAGEMENT MODEL WITHOUT SOLVING THE MODIFIED SINGLE OBJECTIVE MODEL ITERATIVELY. ALSO, THE META MODEL APPROACH IS SHOWN TO BE COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT IN GENERATING THE NONDOMINATED FRONT, ESPECIALLY WHEN A PARTIALLY TRAINED (ANN BASED) META MODEL IS USED AS AN INITIAL SCREENING MODEL FOR THE NONDOMINATED FRONT SEARCH PROCESS.

DEVELOPMENT OF ROBUST MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT NEEDS ATTENTION ESPECIALLY WHEN IT RESULTS IN NEAR OPTIMAL STRATEGIES EVEN WHEN DEVIATIONS FROM PRESCRIBED STRATEGIES OCCUR IN THE FIELD IMPLEMENTATION STAGE. IMPLEMENTATION OF A STRATEGY REQUIRES FIELD SCALE MONITORING TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT IN TERMS OF COMPLIANCE WITH MANAGEMENT GOALS DUE TO POSSIBLE DEVIATION FROM AN OPTIMAL PRESCRIBED STRATEGY. DESIGN OF SUCH AN OPTIMAL MONITORING NETWORK FOR COMPLIANCE ALSO REQUIRES ROBUST OPTIMAL DESIGN DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED. DEVIATIONS FROM PRESCRIBED STRATEGIES IN THE FIELD ARE OFTEN MORE SENSITIVE TO UNCERTAINTIES IN THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE. A MULTIPLE OBJECTIVE MANAGEMENT MODEL FOR ROBUST OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT OF SALTWATER INTRUSION IN COASTAL AQUIFERS IS PROPOSED.

BESIDES, RECLAMATION OF A VAST AREA OF UNCULTIVATED WASTELAND FOR AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY IS ANOTHER CHALLENGE FOR THE FAST GROWING POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY. A FIELD EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF POND ASH APPLICATION ON THE YIELD AND NUTRIENT COMPOSITION OF WHEAT, MAIZE AND EGGPLANT CROPS GROWN IN SEQUENCE ON AN UNCULTIVATED FALLOW LAND. POND ASH COLLECTED FROM THE ANPARA TPP INDIA WAS MIXED WITH SOIL AT 100 T HA( 1). ASH APPLICATION HAD A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON THE WHEAT YIELD. ADDITION OF POND ASH RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE CONTENTS OF N, R K, S, CA, MG, AND MICRO NUTRIENTS. THE UPTAKE OF TOXIC TRACE ELEMENTS (PB, SE, CR, AND CU) WAS BELOW THE THRESHOLD LEVELS. THE RESIDUAL EFFECT OF ASH ON CROP YIELD AND NUTRIENT COMPOSITION OF THE SUBSEQUENT MAIZE AND EGGPLANT CROPS WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANT. THE OVERALL BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF POND ASH ON CROPS COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE SOIL PHYSICAL QUALITY DUE TO ASH AMENDMENT.

SHORELINE CHANGE WAS ANALYZED USING THE ARCGIS EXTENSION DIGITAL SHORELINE ANALYSIS SYSTEM (DSAS) TO UNDERSTAND THIS IMPORTANT ASPECT OF COASTAL MANAGEMENT. THIS WORK ALSO EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF GEOTECHNICAL ASSESSMENT OF COASTAL PROTECTION STRUCTURES IN DIAGNOSING THEIR DEGREE OF DAMAGE AND/OR DETERIORATION SO THAT ONE CAN PLAN MORE EFFICIENT MAINTENANCE WORKS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE A GENERAL TREND OF EROSION TO THE SOUTH AND ACCRETION TO THE NORTH OF THE ESPINHO COASTAL AREA. GEOENGINEERING CHARACTERIZATION OF THE PARAMOS GROIN DEFINES THREE MAIN ZONES FOR THE ARMOR BLOCK MATERIALS (I.E., ZONES I, II/III, AND IV), WHICH SHOW, RESPECTIVELY, VERY LOW, MEDIUM TO HIGH, AND LOW DETERIORATION LEVELS.	***

ONE OF THE CURRENT APPLICATIONS OF DDT IN CHINA HAS BEEN THROUGH ANTIFOULING PAINT FOR FISHING SHIPS AS AN ACTIVE COMPONENT. IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 5000 T OF DDT WAS RELEASED INTO THE CHINESE COASTAL ENVIRONMENT DURING THE LAST TWO DECADES. THEREFORE, SEDIMENTS IN COASTAL FISHING HARBORS OF CHINA MAY BE THE IMPORTANT SINKS OF DDT. IN THIS STUDY, DDT AND ITS METABOLITES IN 58 SEDIMENT SAMPLES FROM NINE TYPICAL FISHING HARBORS ALONG THE COASTAL LINE OF CHINA WERE CHARACTERIZED TO ASSESS THEIR ACCUMULATION LEVELS, SEDIMENT BURDENS, AND POTENTIAL ECOLOGICAL RISKS. THE CONCENTRATIONS OF DOTS RANGED FROM 9 TO 7350 NG/G DRY WEIGHT, WHICH WERE GENERALLY 1 2 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN THOSE OF THE ADJACENT ESTUARINE/MARINE SEDIMENTS. THE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF DDT COUPLED WITH THE LOWER CONCENTRATIONS OF HCH AND TOC CLEARLY INDICATED A STRONG LOCAL DDT INPUT, I.E., DDT CONTAINING ANTIFOULING PAINT, WITHIN THE FISHING HARBORS. A SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TOTAL DDT CONCENTRATIONS AND P,P DDT CONCENTRATIONS FURTHER CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF FRESH DDT INPUT. THE OVERALL BURDEN OF DOTS WITHIN THE UPPER 10 CM SEDIMENT LAYER IN THE FISHING HARBORS OF THE PEARL RIVER DELTA, SOUTHERN CHINA, WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 1.0 5.7 T, WHICH WAS SEVERAL TIMES HIGHER THAN THE DDT ACCUMULATION IN THE SURFACE SEDIMENT OF THE PEARL RIVER ESTUARY. THE CONCENTRATIONS OF DOTS IN THE FISHING HARBOR SEDIMENTS SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDED THE SEDIMENT QUALITY GUIDELINES ON THE BASIS OF ADVERSE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS. THE ABSENCE OR LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF P,P DDD IN AQUATIC ORGANISMS AND HUMAN MAY IMPLY THAT EITHER P,P DDD MAY BE LESS BIOACCUMULATED BY FISH AND HUMAN, OR IS BIOTRANSFORMED TO OTHER METABOLITES. A NATIONAL BAN OF DDT AS AN ADDITIVE TO ANTIFOULING PAINT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN 2009 IN CHINA; HOWEVER, THE LEGACY HIGH DDT BURDEN IN THE COASTAL FISHING HARBORS NEEDS FURTHER MONITORING AND PROPER MANAGEMENT.	***

THE FOCUS AREA WAS THE CORAL COAST IN THE SOUTH OF VITI LEVU ISLAND, WHERE INTERNATIONAL TOURISM IS EXPANDING BUT STREAM AND COASTAL WATERS ARE UNDER THREAT OF POLLUTION FROM THE LARGELY UNCONTROLLED RELEASE OF PIG WASTE INTO THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT. THE INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT PARTICIPATORY APPROACHES ARE EFFECTIVE AT THE VILLAGE LEVEL IF CORRECT TOOLS ARE USED AND IF THE RESEARCH PROCESS ADAPTS TO COMMUNITY NEEDS. IN PARTICULAR, PLA METHODS IN THE TWO STUDY VILLAGES (KOMAVE AND VOTUA) WERE ABLE TO ASSIST DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS TO IDENTIFY AND THEN PRIORITISE A RANGE OF PIG WASTE PROBLEMS, INCLUDING DETERIORATING WATER QUALITY, PUBLIC HEALTH AND AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY. ENCOURAGEMENT BY PLA FACILITATORS FOR COMMUNITIES TO TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THESE PROBLEMS LED EVENTUALLY TO ONE VILLAGE INSTALLING A NEW PIG MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

THE MANAGEMENT OF COASTAL AQUIFERS REQUIRES CAREFUL PLANNING OF WITHDRAWAL STRATEGIES FOR CONTROL AND REMEDIATION OF SALTWATER INTRUSION. PREDICTION AND CONTROL OF FUTURE SALTWATER DISTRIBUTION IN COASTAL AQUIFER MAY BE POSSIBLE BY SIMULATING THE PROCESSES UTILIZING MATHEMATICAL MODELS. A FINITE ELEMENT BASED FLOW AND TRANSPORT SIMULATION MODEL IS IMPLEMENTED FOR A COASTAL AQUIFER IN NELLORE DISTRICT OF ANDHRA PRADESH, INDIA. THE MODEL IS CALIBRATED FOR TWO YEARS OF TIME PERIOD BETWEEN JULY 2000 AND JULY 2002, BOTH IN TERMS OF HYDRAULIC HEADS AND SALT CONCENTRATION. THE CALIBRATED MODEL IS VALIDATED FOR NEXT TWO YEARS IN TERMS OF HEAD AND SALT CONCENTRATION WITH THE AVAILABLE DATA FOR JULY 2002 AND JULY 2004. THE LIMITED DATA AVAILABILITY IN THIS STUDY AREA MAY REPRESENT A TYPICAL REAL LIFE SITUATION. THE CALIBRATED AND PARTIALLY VALIDATED SIMULATION MODEL IS USED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PLANNED PUMPING STRATEGIES TO LOCALLY CONTROL THE SALTWATER INTRUSION IN THE STUDY AREA. THESE LIMITED EVALUATIONS SHOW THE POTENTIAL FOR USING A PLANNED PUMPING STRATEGY AND THEREFORE HYDRAULIC CONTROL MEASURES TO AFFECT THE SALTWATER INTRUSION PROCESS. THESE SIMULATIONS ARE ALSO USEFUL FOR EVOLVING PLANNED PUMPING STRATEGIES FOR CONTROL OF SALTWATER INTRUSION IN A COASTAL AQUIFER. (C) 2009 PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER B.V.

LIKE MANY PROBLEMS IN HYDROLOGY, NUMBERS OF METHODS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED FOR STREAMFLOW PARTITIONING. FIVE METHODS WERE IDENTIFIED AS BEING THE MOST RELEVANT AND LEAST INPUT INTENSIVE. THIS STUDY TESTED PERFORMANCE OF THESE METHODS AGAINST SEPARATELY MEASURED SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE FLOW DATA FROM THE COASTAL PLAIN PHYSIOGRAPHIC REGION OF THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. SEPARATELY MEASURED SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE FLOW WERE COLLECTED FOR 12 YEARS (1970 1981) IN A FIELD SCALE WATERSHED BY THE SOUTHEAST WATERSHED RESEARCH LABORATORY OF THE USDA AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE. RESULTS OF COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT METHOD IV PERFORMED THE BEST. RESULTS ALSO INDICATED THAT ACCURACY OF THIS METHOD IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE PROPER ESTIMATION OF THE FRACTION COEFFICIENT THAT IS BASED ON MANY PHYSICAL AND HYDROLOGIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE WATERSHED. THIS STUDY CONCLUDED THAT DETERMINISTIC/EMPIRICAL METHODS SUCH AS BOUGHTONS METHOD IV, REQUIRE PROPER PARAMETER VALUE FOR INCREASED ACCURACY.	***

IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE EVALUATE THE PERSISTENCE OF ENTEROCOCCI, ENTEROVIRUS, AND HUMAN SPECIFIC BACTEROIDALES IN SEAWATER MICROCOSMS. TWO MICROCOSMS CONSISTED OF SEAWATER SEEDED WITH HUMAN SEWAGE. TWO ADDITIONAL SEAWATER MICROCOSMS WERE SEEDED WITH NAKED ENTEROCOCCUS FAECIUM DNA AND POLIOVIRUS RNA. ONE OF EACH REPLICATE MICROCOSM WAS EXPOSED TO NATURAL SUNLIGHT; THE OTHER WAS KEPT IN COMPLETE DARKNESS. IN THE SEWAGE MICROCOSMS, CONCENTRATIONS OF ENTEROCOCCI AND ENTEROVIRUS WERE MEASURED USING STANDARD CULTURE DEPENDENT METHODS AS WELL AS QPCR AND RT QPCR RESPECTIVELY. CONCENTRATIONS OF HUMAN SPECIFIC BACTEROIDALES WERE DETERMINED WITH QPCR. IN THE NAKED GENOME MICROCOSMS, ENTEROCOCCI AND ENTEROVIRUS MARKERS WERE ENUMERATED USING QPCR AND RT QPCR, RESPECTIVELY. IN THE SEWAGE MICROCOSM EXPOSED TO SUNLIGHT, CONCENTRATIONS OF CULTURABLE ENTEROCOCCI FELL BELOW THE DETECTION LIMIT WITHIN 5 DAYS, BUT THE QPCR SIGNAL PERSISTED UNTIL THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT (DAY 28). CULTURABLE ENTEROCOCCI DID NOT PERSIST AS LONG AS INFECTIOUS ENTEROVIRUSES. THE ABILITY TO CULTURE ENTEROVIRUSES AND ENTEROCOCCI WAS LOST BEFORE DETECTION OF THE GENETIC MARKERS WAS LOST, BUT THE HUMAN SPECIFIC BACTEROIDALES QPCR SIGNAL PERSISTED FOR A SIMILAR DURATION AS INFECTIOUS ENTEROVIRUSES IN THE SEWAGE MICROCOSM EXPOSED TO SUNLIGHT. IN THE NAKED GENOME MICROCOSMS, DNA AND RNA FROM ENTEROCOCCI AND ENTEROVIRUS, RESPECTIVELY, PERSISTED FOR OVER 10 D AND DID NOT VARY BETWEEN THE LIGHT AND DARK TREATMENTS.

THE MODEL CALIBRATION PROCEDURES CONSISTED OF CALIBRATING THE AQUIFER SYSTEM HYDRAULIC PARAMETERS BY HISTORY MATCHING UNDER STEADY AND TRANSIENT CONDITIONS. THE HISTORY OF INPUT AND OUTPUT OF THE AQUIFER WERE RECONSTRUCTED IN A TRANSIENT CALIBRATION FROM 1993 TO 2005. PREDICTIVE SIMULATION OF THE AQUIFER WAS CARRIED OUT UNDER TRANSIENT CONDITIONS TO PREDICT THE FUTURE DEMAND OF GROUNDWATER SUPPLY FOR THE NEXT 15 YEARS. A BASELINE SCENARIO WAS WORKED OUT TO OBTAIN THE PIEZOMETRIC SURFACE AND SALINITY DISTRIBUTION FOR THE BUSINESS AS USUAL CONDITIONS OF THE AQUIFER. THE BUSINESS AS USUAL SCENARIO WAS PREDICTED AND SIMULATED FOR THE PERIOD 2006 UNTIL 2020. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SEVEN MANAGEMENT OPTIONS WAS PROPOSED AND ASSESSED FOR COMPARISON WITH THE BUSINESS AS USUAL CONDITIONS. THE ESTABLISHED SIMULATION MODEL WAS USED TO PREDICT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE PIEZOMETRIC SURFACE, SALINITY DISTRIBUTION, AND MASS BALANCE UNDER THE PROPOSED SCENARIOS FOR THE PREDICTION PERIOD 2006 2020. THE SCENARIOS WERE: (1) RELOCATE GARZIZ AND MAF FARMS FAR FROM THE FRESHWATER ZONE, (2) SUSPEND THE ABSTRACTION OF GRASS PRODUCTION FOR 4 MONTHS A YEAR, (3) CHANGES IN AGRICULTURAL AND IRRIGATION SYSTEM PATTERNS, (4) ESTABLISH A DESALINATION PLANT, (5) COMBINED SCENARIO (1 + 4), (6) COMBINED SCENARIO (1 + 3), AND (7) COMBINING ALL SCENARIOS (1 + 2 + 3 + 4). THE RESULT OF THE SIMULATION SHOWS THAT THE BEST EFFECTIVE OPTION IN TERMS OF AQUIFER GROUNDWATER LEVELS IS THE FIFTH PROPOSED SCENARIO AND THE SIXTH PROPOSED SCENARIO IS THE BEST EFFECTIVE OPTION IN TERMS OF AQUIFER GROUNDWATER SALINITY SITUATION DURING THE NEXT 15 YEARS. THIS PROJECT SUGGESTED THE APPLICATION OF SCENARIO 6 AS IT IS ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND IN TERMS OF SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT. A PREDICTION HAS BEEN MADE WHICH SHOWS THAT FURTHER ACTIONS HAVE TO BE TAKEN WITHIN THE NEXT TWO DECADES TO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF THE MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLY. THE MANAGEMENT SCENARIOS ARE EXAMINED IN THE CASE OF THE SALALAH COASTAL AQUIFER USING GROUNDWATER SIMULATION, WHICH CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO OTHER REGIONS WITH SIMILAR CONDITIONS. THE ESTABLISHED MODEL IS CONSIDERED A REASONABLE REPRESENTATION OF THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF THE SALALAH PLAIN AQUIFER, AND CAN BE USED AS A TOOL BY THE WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE GROUNDWATER IN THE REGION.	***

A SET OF TYPE CURVES WAS DEVELOPED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE CURVES ACCOUNT FOR THE ADVECTION EFFECT OF GROUNDWATER FLOW AND CAN BE APPLIED UNDER DIFFERENT AQUIFER AND TIDAL CONDITIONS TO ESTIMATE THE RESULTING TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION. THE PROPOSED METHOD WILL BE IMPORTANT IN EVALUATING THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF URBANIZATION AND CLIMATE CHANGE ON COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS WHERE LIMITED OBSERVATION WELLS ARE AVAILABLE. THE PRACTICAL APPLICABILITY OF THE COMPOSED METHODOLOGY WAS TESTED IN THE SENDAI PLAIN. CONTINUOUS 1 H WATER LEVEL (FROM APRIL, 2005 TO JULY, 2007) AND TEMPERATURE (FROM MAY, 2007 TO FEBRUARY, 2008) OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE AT THREE AQUIFER DEPTHS IN EACH OBSERVATION WELL AT FOUR LOCATIONS TO EXAMINE THE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIATIONS. TIME SERIES ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO FIND THE CORRELATIONS OF THE TIDAL AND GROUNDWATER LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS. RESULTS OF THE PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS AND THE TIME SERIES ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THE GROUNDWATER LEVEL WITHIN 20 M DEPTH FROM THE GROUND SURFACE IS MORE SENSITIVE TO THE RECHARGE FROM PRECIPITATION, WHILE THE DEPTHS BELOW 20 M ARE GREATLY INFLUENCED BY THE TIDAL FLUCTUATIONS. REASONABLY HIGH CROSS CORRELATION (0.74) WAS FOUND IN TIDES WITH WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS, AND IT WAS ALSO NOTED THAT THE TIDAL EFFECT ON GROUNDWATER LEVEL FLUCTUATION AND TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION SIGNIFICANTLY DECAYS AS THE DISTANCE FROM THE COAST INCREASES. THE SIMULATED TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION FROM THE PROPOSED ANALYTICAL SOLUTION SHOWS GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE OBSERVED TEMPERATURE RECORDS. AMONG THE HYDROGEOLOGIC PARAMETERS, HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY HAS A ROBUST INFLUENCE IN DETERMINING THE PATTERN OF TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION WITHIN THE SEA WATER AND FRESH GROUNDWATER BOUNDARIES. VERIFIED RESULTS IN THE SENDAI PLAIN INDICATED THAT THE INDIVIDUAL EFFECT OF SEAWATER TEMPERATURE CHANGE HAS A MORE PROFOUND EFFECT ON TEMPERATURE CHANGE NEAR TO THE COAST THAN A FRESH GROUNDWATER TEMPERATURE CHANGE. COMBINED EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE CHANGE AT TWO BOUNDARIES WITHIN THE RANGE OF +/ 1 DEGREES C WILL LEAD TO A 0.4 1 DEGREES C TEMPERATURE CHANGE AT A DISTANCE 500 M AWAY FROM THE COAST WHERE IN GENERAL, THE COASTAL WETLANDS ARE LOCATED. THESE FIGURES MAY BE SIGNIFICANT FOR MAINTAINING OR ACHIEVING THE ECOLOGICAL BALANCE OF COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS, AND THE FINDINGS OF THIS RESEARCH WILL ASSIST PLANNERS AND DECISION MAKERS IN COASTAL ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS.

MARSH FLOODING CAN BE ESTIMATED OVER LARGE AREAS WITH FEW DATA WHERE WINDS HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON WATER LEVELS, BUT QUANTIFYING FLOODING REQUIRES HOURLY MEASUREMENTS OVER LONG TIME PERIODS WHERE TIDES ARE WIND DOMINATED SUCH AS THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO. ESTIMATING SALINITY OF FLOOD WATER REQUIRES DIRECT DAILY MEASUREMENTS BECAUSE COASTAL MARSHES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY DYNAMIC SALINITY GRADIENTS.

THE SALINITY VARIED FROM 0 PPT (FRESH WATER) TO 30 PPT. THE MS 2 IN THE FRESH WATER SHOWED VERY WEAK ADSORPTION DUE TO HAVING THE SAME NEGATIVE CHARGE AS THE SAND. INCREASING THE SALINITY CONCENTRATIONS DRAMATICALLY ENHANCED MS 2 ADSORPTION. THE MS 2 BREAKTHROUGH REVEALED THE EXISTENCE OF REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE SORPTION SITES IN THE SAND. SALINITY INCREASED MS 2 ATTACHMENT BY COMPRESSING THE DOUBLE LAYERS OF MS 2 AND REVERSIBLE SORPTION SITES. THE SALINITY ALSO CHANGED SOME REVERSIBLE SORPTION SITES INTO IRREVERSIBLE SORPTION SITES BY REVERSING TO POSITIVE SURFACE CHARGES OF SILICA POWDER. AN ADVECTION DISPERSION SORPTION MODEL WITH A TWO SITE REVERSIBLE IRREVERSIBLE KINETIC SORPTION WAS DEVELOPED TO DESCRIBE MS 2 BREAKTHROUGH UNDER DIFFERENT SALINITY CONDITIONS. THE SORPTION PARAMETERS WERE ESTIMATED AND THEIR INDEPENDENCE WAS EVALUATED BY MINIMIZING THE TOTAL SQUARED ERROR OF THE MS 2 DATA. THE PROPOSED MODEL SHOWED GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA FOR A WIDE RANGE OF SALINITY LEVELS FROM FRESH WATER TO NEAR SEAWATER. THE STRONG SORPTION SHOWN IN THE MS 2 BREAKTHROUGH AT HIGH SALINITY LEVELS ABOVE 8 PPT WAS ABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE PROPOSED MODEL FROM OTHER SORPTION MODELS. THIS STUDY PROMOTES THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE VIRAL SORPTION WITH SALINITY AND PROVIDES A USEFUL MODEL FOR COASTAL MANAGEMENT OF VIRAL MIGRATION IN SALINE COASTAL GROUNDWATER.	***

THE LAKES HAVE AN AVERAGE WATER DEPTH OF 1 3 M, AND RECEIVE SURFACE WATER INFLOWS BUT HAVE AN UNCERTAIN INTERACTION WITH THE UNDERLYING KARSTIC CARBONIFEROUS LIMESTONE. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE APPLICATION OF THE SOIL WATER ASSESSMENT TOOL (SWAT) TO IMPROVE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE HYDROLOGICAL FUNCTIONING OF THE LAKE SYSTEM. THE TEMPORALLY VARIABLE AND LIMITED OBSERVATIONAL DATA WERE USED WITHIN A TWO STEP CALIBRATION PROCESS. THE SIMULATED SURFACE WATER INFLOWS AND GROUNDWATER LEVELS WERE CALIBRATED, FOLLOWED BY THE LAKE VOLUMES (NASH SUTCLIFFE (NS) COEFFICIENT RANGING FROM 0.67 TO 0.74). FINALLY THE SIMULATED LAKE VOLUMES WERE VALIDATED (NS RANGING FROM 0.56 TO 0.74) AND THE SIMULATED LAKE OUTFLOWS DEMONSTRATED TO BE PLAUSIBLE. SIMULATIONS REVEAL THAT THREE OF THE FOUR LINKED WATER BODIES LOSE SIGNIFICANT WATER TO THE UNDERLYING AQUIFER. THE SIMULATED WATER BALANCE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE CATCHMENT OUTPUTS ARE DOMINATED BY EVAPOTRANSPIRATION, SURFACE OUTFLOW FROM THE LAKE SYSTEM TO THE SEA AND COASTAL GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE, WITH ABSTRACTION AND LAKE EVAPORATION BEING OF LESSER IMPORTANCE. THE COASTAL GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE ORIGINATES FROM BOTH LEAKAGE FROM THE LAKES AND PREVIOUSLY UNRECOGNISED LARGER SCALE GROUNDWATER FLOW PATHS IN THE LIMESTONE AQUIFER. THE STUDY HAS PROVIDED AN IMPROVED BASIS FOR THE FUTURE HYDROLOGICAL MANAGEMENT OF THE CATCHMENT AND LAKES AND HAS DEMONSTRATED THE WIDER UTILITY OF SWAT IN SIMULATING KARSTIC SYSTEMS.

THIS CONTRIBUTION STUDIES THE HYDRODYNAMIC CONDITIONS WITHIN BILBAO HARBOUR, WHICH IS ENCLOSED BY THE NERVION ESTUARY (IN THE BASQUE COUNTRY, SPAIN). THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM HYDROGRAPHICAL SURVEYS ARE COMPARED WITH NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OBTAINED USING THE REGIONAL OCEAN MODELLING SYSTEM (ROMS). HYDRODYNAMIC MODELLING WAS CARRIED OUT TO DETERMINE THE INNER HARBOUR CURRENTS FOR A SPECIFIC PERIOD IN WHICH DATA WERE AVAILABLE. THEN, NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS WERE DESIGNED IN ORDER TO QUANTIFY THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT DRIVING MECHANISMS IN THE HARBOUR HYDRODYNAMICS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT, IN ADDITION TO THE STRONG TIDAL INFLUENCE ON WATER CIRCULATION, THE WIND FORCING AND FRESHWATER DISCHARGE ALSO HAVE A NON NEGLIGIBLE INFLUENCE ON THE CURRENTS. THE COMPUTATIONAL DOMAIN IS COMPLEX DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF HARBOUR INFRASTRUCTURES (I.E. BREAKWATERS AND PIERS). AS A RESULT. TOPOGRAPHIC EDDIES ARE THEREFORE OBSERVED IN THE RESULTS. THE FRESHWATER INFLUENCE OF THE NERVION RIVER CAN ALSO BE OBSERVED IN RESIDUAL CURRENTS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN IMPROVEMENT TO THE APPLICATION OF NUMERICAL MODELLING TO A COMPLEX GEOMETRY DOMAIN, CONTRIBUTING TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE MARINE SYSTEMS IN MESO TIDAL HARBOURS. THIS CAN BE USED TO DEAL WITH HARBOUR ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS. (C) 2009 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

IN THE GCJC AREA, NITRATE LEVELS EXCEED THE MAXIMUM CONTAMINANT LEVEL (MCL) OF 10 MG/L NO(3) N (45 MG/L NO(3)) IN MANY WELLS. ELEVATED NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS IN THE GROUNDWATER OF GCJC AREA ARE DUE TO THE DISPOSAL OF UNTREATED WASTEWATER, THE EXISTENCE OF HEAVY AGRICULTURE IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS, AND THE USE OF CESSPITS FOR WASTEWATER DISPOSAL. THE DEVELOPED LPMS UTILIZE MONTHLY TIME STEPS AND TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ALL THE SOURCES AND SINKS OF WATER AND NITRATE IN THE STUDY AREA. THE MAIN OUTCOMES OF THE LPMS ARE THE AVERAGE TEMPORAL WATER TABLE ELEVATION AND NITRATE CONCENTRATION. IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE LPMS USABILITY, A SET OF MANAGEMENT OPTIONS TO REDUCE NITRATE CONCENTRATION IN THE GROUNDWATER OF THE STUDY AREA WERE PROPOSED AND EVALUATED USING THE DEVELOPED LPMS. FOUR BROAD MANAGEMENT OPTIONS WERE CONSIDERED WHERE THESE OPTIONS TACKLE THE REDUCTION OF NITRATE CONCENTRATION IN THE LATERAL INFLOW, REHABILITATION OF THE WASTEWATER COLLECTION SYSTEM, REDUCTION IN CESSPIT USAGE, AND THE RESTRICTION ON THE USE OF NITROGEN BASED FERTILIZERS. IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT OPTIONS THAT ENCOMPASS DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF THE SINGLE MANAGEMENT OPTIONS WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. DIFFERENT SCENARIOS THAT CORRESPOND TO THE DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT OPTIONS WERE INVESTIGATED. IT WAS FOUND BASED ON THE LPMS THAT INDIVIDUAL MANAGEMENT OPTIONS WERE NOT EFFECTIVE IN MEETING THE MCL OF NITRATE. HOWEVER. THE COMBINATION OF THE FOUR SINGLE MANAGEMENT OPTIONS WITH FULL REHABILITATION AND COVERAGE OF THE WASTEWATER COLLECTION NETWORK ALONG WITH AT LEAST 60% REDUCTION IN BOTH NITRATE CONCENTRATION IN THE LATERAL INFLOW AND THE USE OF NITROGEN BASED FERTILIZERS WOULD MEET THE MCL CONSTRAINT BY THE END OF THE MANAGEMENT PERIOD.

THE GA BASED OPTIMIZATION APPROACH IS ESPECIALLY SUITABLE FOR EXTERNALLY LINKING A NUMERICAL SIMULATION MODEL WITHIN THE OPTIMIZATION MODEL. HOWEVER, THE SOLUTION OF A LINKED SIMULATION OPTIMIZATION MODEL IS COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE, AS A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF ITERATIONS BETWEEN THE OPTIMIZATION AND THE SIMULATION MODELS ARE NECESSARY TO ARRIVE AT AN OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND FEASIBILITY FOR SUCH LINKED MODELS CAN BE ENHANCED BY SIMPLIFYING THE SIMULATION PROCESS BY AN APPROXIMATION. A POSSIBLE APPROACH FOR SUCH APPROXIMATION IS THE USE OF AN ANN MODEL. IN THIS PAPER, AN ANN MODEL IS DEVELOPED INITIALLY AS AN APPROXIMATE SIMULATOR OF THE THREE DIMENSIONAL DENSITY DEPENDENT FLOW AND TRANSPORT PROCESSES IN A COASTAL AQUIFER. A SIMULATION OPTIMIZATION MODEL IS THEN DEVELOPED BY LINKING THE ANN MODEL WITH A GA BASED OPTIMIZATION MODEL FOR SOLVING MULTIPLE OBJECTIVE SALTWATER MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OPTIMIZATION MODELS IS EVALUATED USING AN ILLUSTRATIVE STUDY AREA. FOR COMPARISON OF THE SOLUTION RESULTS, A MULTIPLE OBJECTIVE MANAGEMENT MODEL IS ALSO SOLVED USING EMBEDDED FORMULATION AND CLASSICAL NONLINEAR OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUE. THE COMPARISON OF RESULTS SHOWS POTENTIAL FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY IN SOLVING MULTIPLE OBJECTIVE MANAGEMENT MODEL FOR COASTAL AQUIFERS.	***

OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR ADDRESSING EXCESS, OBSOLETE, AND UNSERVICEABLE MUNITIONS PRIOR TO THE 1970S WERE LIMITED TO SALVAGE, DESTRUCTION BY OPEN DETONATION OR OPEN BURNING, OR BURIAL ON LAND OR AT SEA. SEA DISPOSAL OF CONVENTIONAL AND CHEMICAL MUNITIONS AND OTHER WASTE MATERIAL WAS CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE UNTIL THE ENACTMENT OF THE CONVENTION ON THE PREVENTION OF MARINE POLLUTION BY DUMPING OF WASTES, AND OTHER MATTER IN 1972 AND ITS 1996 PROTOCOL PROHIBITING SEA DISPOSAL OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL AGENTS. THE 1993 CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION CONTAINS A SIMILAR BAN. SEA DISPOSED MUNITIONS POSE TWO TYPES OF RISK. THESE ARE ACUTE INJURY OR DEATH CAUSED BY EITHER DETONATION OR DIRECT EXPOSURE TO CHEMICAL AGENTS AND CHRONIC ADVERSE HEALTH IMPACTS RESULTING FROM PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO MUNITION CONSTITUENTS. THE TYPE AND CONFIGURATION OF SEA DISPOSED MUNITIONS, DISPOSAL LOCATION, WATER BODY PROPERTIES (E.G., DEPTH, CURRENT), AND ITS USAGE (E.G., COMMERCIAL FISHING, RECREATION, PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION) ARE FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE RELATIVE RISK POSED BY MUNITIONS. THE COLLECTION, ANALYSIS, AND SHARING OF HISTORICAL INFORMATION ALLOW MORE EFFICIENT INVESTIGATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS FROM SEA DISPOSED MUNITIONS.	***

A SIMPLE BUT EFFICIENT STATISTICAL METHOD TO ESTIMATE THE MEAN OF A CRENULATED SHAPED BAY FROM ITS EQUILIBRIUM SHAPE IS PROPOSED WITH INPUT AS THE WAVE CLIMATE. THE MATHEMATICAL MODELLING IS BASED ON ENSEMBLE AVERAGING AND AN EQUILIBRIUM BAY SHAPE MODEL. IN THIS WORK, THE EFFECTS OF THE COEFFICIENTS IN THE CRENULATED SHAPED BAY ON THE ESTIMATION ARE INVESTIGATED IN A SEQUENCE OF PROBLEMS OF SUCCESSIVE GENERALITY. AS A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE, THE METHOD HAS BEEN APPLIED TO CHRISTCHURCH BAY IN THE UK. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE ENSEMBLE AVERAGE APPROACH COULD PROVIDE AN EFFICIENT MEANS OF ESTIMATING BEACH RESPONSE TO RANDOM WAVE CONDITIONS	***

IT AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE SEAWATER INTRUSION, TO DETERMINE THE REGIONAL WATER BALANCE OF THE REGION AND FINALLY TO ESTIMATE THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF THAT WATER FOR AGRICULTURAL USE. THE MONITORING OF THE AQUIFER WAS ACHIEVED THROUGH SAMPLES FROM DIFFERENT WELLS CHOSEN RANDOMLY. AS FOR THE REGIONAL WATER BALANCE, IT WAS DETERMINED WITH USE OF A GIS MODEL. THE ECONOMIC EVALUATION WAS CARRIED OUT, USING THE CONTINGENT VALUATION METHOD TO ESTIMATE THE WILLINGNESS TO PAY OF FARMERS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF GROUNDWATER QUALITY; TWO ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS WERE PROPOSED AND COMPARED WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION. THE ANNUAL REGIONAL WATER BALANCE IS POSITIVE, WHICH MEANS THAT THE REGION IS RICH IN WATER. THE MONITORING RESULTS SHOW THAT THE COASTAL PART OF THE REGION IS SLIGHTLY CONTAMINATED BY SEAWATER INTRUSION DUE TO THE EXCESS OF PUMPING FROM THE AQUIFER. THE ECONOMIC EVALUATION ESTIMATED THAT FARMERS WOULD CONTRIBUTE BY 102 US$ YR ( AEURO PARTS PER THOUSAND 1) FOR THE FIRST PROPOSAL AND 166.67 US$ YR ( AEURO PARTS PER THOUSAND 1) FOR THE SECOND.	***

FOR COASTAL DESALINATION PLANTS, THE MOST PRACTICAL AND LEAST EXPENSIVE BRINE DISPOSAL METHOD IS TO DISCHARGE IT INTO THE SEA AT THE PLANTS OUTFALL. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SEVERAL HARMFUL ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS CAUSED BY THIS DIRECT DISCHARGE. THIS DISCHARGED BRINE (CONCENTRATE WASTEWATER) HAS MANY PROPERTIES, WHICH BADLY AFFECTS THE ENVIRONMENT. IT CONSISTS OF HIGHLY CONCENTRATED SALTS AND ANY UN REACTED PRE TREATMENT CHEMICALS. IT ALSO BRINGS WITH IT HEAVY METALS RESULTING FROM THE CORROSION OF TUBE AND FLASH CHAMBER WALL MATERIAL. THEREFORE, THE LARGEST IMPACT OF DESALINATION ON THE ENVIRONMENT OCCURS AT THE OUTFALL OF THE DESALINATION PLANT. THIS WORK ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM OF BRINE OR WASTEWATER GENERATED FROM DESALINATION PRODUCTION PROCESS. THE WORK WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH BRINE WASTES BY USING THE BRINE FOR ON SITE GENERATION OF SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE. SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE IS A USEFUL AND VALUABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCT. IT IS THE MOST WIDELY USED ACTIVE CHLORINE COMPOUND IN DISINFECTION. IN GENERAL, THE SUGGESTED EXPERIMENTAL PROCESS WAS AIMED AT THE DUAL BENEFIT OF ON SITE GENERATION OF SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE AND REDUCING THE CONCENTRATION OF THE BRINE. THEREFORE, THE PROCESS WILL NOT ONLY GENERATE THE SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE, BUT ALSO WILL PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT.	***

WATER YIELD FROM WATERSHEDS IS A MAJOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICE FOR HUMAN ACTIVITIES BUT HAS BEEN DRAMATICALLY ALTERED BY LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT SUPERIMPOSED ON CLIMATIC VARIABILITY AND CHANGE. MANY STUDIES FROM DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE WORLD HAVE DOCUMENTED THAT IN SMALL WATERSHEDS (<100 HA) FAST GROWING FOREST PLANTATIONS REDUCE WATER YIELD. NEVERTHELESS, THESE EFFECTS HAVE NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY DOCUMENTED IN LARGE WATERSHEDS >10,000 HA. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXAMINE THE TEMPORAL VARIATION OF THE RESIDUALS BETWEEN BEST FIT PRECIPITATION RUNOFF RELATIONSHIPS AND INSTRUMENTAL STREAMFLOW RECORDS FOR TWO LARGE WATERSHEDS (PURAPEL EN NIRIVILO, PNN AND CAUQUENES EN EL ARRAYAN, CQA) LOCATED IN THE MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE COASTAL RANGE OF SOUTH CENTRAL CHILE. IN THESE WATERSHEDS, HIGH RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A DECLINE IN NATIVE FOREST COVER FROM 52.3% TO 14.2% FOR PPN AND 36.1% TO 8.1% IN CQA, BETWEEN 1975 AND 2000. CONVERSELY, IN THE SAME PERIOD THE PERCENTAGE AREA COVERED BY FOREST PLANTATIONS, MAINLY PINUS RADIATA, INCREASED FROM 12% TO 55% IN PPN, AND 4.7% TO 42% IN CQA. WE OBSERVED A DECREASING TREND IN SUMMER RUNOFF RESIDUALS REGRESSED AGAINST ANNUAL PRECIPITATION IN THE SAME PERIOD, WITH SLOPES SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM ZERO FOR PPN (P 0.035) AND CQA (P 0.008). WE INTERPRETED THIS PATTERN AS AN EVIDENCE OF CHANGE IN THE HYDROLOGICAL REGIME IN THESE WATERSHEDS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF FOREST COVER AND LAND USE CHANGES. FROM A REANALYSIS OF THE OBSERVED DATA WE ESTIMATE A DECREASE IN RUNOFF FROM 13.1 TO 7.5 MM/SUMMER FOR PPN AND FROM 7.3 TO 5 MM/SUMMER FOR CQA, REFER TO THE PERIOD 1991 2000 COMPARED TO 1981 1990. MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSES OF ANNUAL AND SEASONAL FLOWS SHOW THAT BESIDES PRECIPITATION, PERCENTAGE COVER OF FOREST PLANTATIONS IS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF SUMMER FLOW WITH A PARTIAL NEGATIVE CORRELATION OF 0.45 AND 0.44 FOR PPN AND CQA, RESPECTIVELY, P < 0.05. THIS STUDY CLEARLY SHOWS THE IMPORTANT EFFECT THAT LAND USE CHANGE CAN HAVE ON WATER YIELD AND TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY DOCUMENTING THE DECREASE IN SUMMER RUNOFF IN A LANDSCAPE WHERE NATIVE FOREST COVER HAS DRAMATICALLY DECLINED AND FOREST EXOTIC PLANTATIONS HAVE EXPANDED. SIMILAR METHODS COULD BE USED ELSEWHERE TO INFORM POLICY AND DECISION MAKING REGARDING FOREST AND LAND USE PLANNING. (C) 2009 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

WE HAVE DEVELOPED A PRACTICAL APPROACH TO REMOVE THESE ERRORS USING ADVANCED VERY HIGH RESOLUTION RADIOMETER (AVHRR) AND MODERATE RESOLUTION IMAGING SPECTRO RADIOMETER (MODIS) 1 KM RESOLUTION DATA. THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF SST ANOMALY ESTIMATES IN THE FLORIDA KEYS AND TO PROVIDE THE BEST QUALITY (IN PARTICULAR, HIGH TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTIONS) SST DATA PRODUCTS FOR THIS REGION. AFTER MANUAL NAVIGATION OF OVER 47000 AVHRR IMAGES (1993 2005), WE IMPLEMENTED A CLOUD FILTERING TECHNIQUE THAT DIFFERS FROM PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED IMAGE PROCESSING METHODS. THE FILTER USED A 12 YEAR CLIMATOLOGY AND 3 DAY RUNNING SST STATISTICS TO FLAG CLOUD CONTAMINATED PIXELS. COMPARISON WITH CONCURRENT (+/ 0.5 H) DATA FROM THE SEAKEYS IN SITU STATIONS IN THE FLORIDA KEYS SHOWED NEAR ZERO BIAS ERRORS (<0.05 DEGREES C) IN THE WEEKLY ANOMALY FOR SST ANOMALIES BETWEEN 3 DEGREES C AND 3 DEGREES C, WITH STANDARD DEVIATIONS <0.5 DEGREES C. THE CLOUD FILTER WAS IMPLEMENTED USING INTERACTIVE DATA LANGUAGE FOR NEAR REAL TIME PROCESSING OF AVHRR AND MODIS DATA. THE IMPROVED SST PRODUCTS WERE USED TO DETECT SST ANOMALIES AND TO ESTIMATE DEGREE HEATING WEEKS (DHWS) TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL FOR CORAL REEF STRESS.

THE CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF SALTWATER UP CONING (I.E. THE PUMPING INDUCED RISE IN THE FRESHWATER SALTWATER INTERFACE) IS BASED PREDOMINANTLY ON THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTS OF SALINITY AND FLOW RESPONSES TO GROUNDWATER PUMPING, PLUS A LIMITED NUMBER OF FIELD SCALE AND LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS. THERE IS A NEED TO PRODUCE DIRECT OBSERVATIONS OF SALTWATER UP CONING, GIVEN THE CONSIDERABLE AND INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREDICTION OF DENSITY DEPENDENT FLOW AND DISPERSIVE SOLUTE TRANSPORT BEHAVIOUR. IN THIS STUDY, TIME SERIES OBSERVATIONS OF SALTWATER UPCONING WERE MADE USING CONTROLLED SAND TANK EXPERIMENTS OF A TWO DIMENSIONAL AQUIFER CROSS SECTION. A RANGE OF MIXED CONVECTION RATIOS WAS TESTED BY INVOKING DIFFERENT GROUNDWATER ABSTRACTION RATES AND SALTWATER DENSITIES. THE TEMPORAL DEVELOPMENT OF UP CONING WAS CHARACTERISED IN TERMS OF THE HEIGHT OF THE INTERFACE APEX, THE WIDTH OF THE SALT PLUME, AND THE SALINITY OF THE PUMPING WELL. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS WERE COMPARED TO AN EXISTING SHARP INTERFACE ANALYTICAL SOLUTION AND CLOSE AGREEMENT WAS OBTAINED FOR TWO OF THE CASES. HIGHER FRESHWATER SALTWATER DENSITY DIFFERENCES AND LOWER PUMPING APPEARED TO INDUCE THE LARGEST DEVIATIONS FROM THEORETICAL UP CONING. DISPERSIVE TRANSPORT PROCESSES DOMINATED DURING PHASES OF NEAR WELL UP CONING, CAUSING GRADUAL INCREASES IN PUMPED WATER SALINITY, ALTHOUGH PLUMES BECAME NON DISPERSIVE AFTER THE INTERFACE MADE CONTACT WITH THE BORE. AN INTERESTING DEPARTURE FROM THE CLASSICAL UP CONING SHAPE WAS OBTAINED FOR THE SITUATION OF HIGHEST SALTWATER DENSITY AND LOWEST PUMPING, IN WHICH UP CONING OCCURRED AS AN ALMOST HORIZONTAL INTERFACE FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE EXPERIMENT, EVENTUALLY PRODUCING A DOUBLE APEX SHAPE AS THE INTERFACE NEARED THE WELL. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS COULD FORM A USEFUL BASIS FOR THE TESTING OF DENSITY DEPENDENT GROUNDWATER FLOW AND TRANSPORT MODELS, SINCE THEY OFFER CONTROLLED LABORATORY ANALOGUES OF SALTWATER UP CONING.

THE MODEL LINKS THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHOSPHORUS CONCENTRATION OVER TIME TO NUTRIENT EMISSIONS FROM AGRICULTURE AND HABITATION. IT ACCOUNTS FOR DIFFERENCES IN AGRICULTURAL AND MUNICIPAL ABATEMENT OPTIONS AND THEIR COSTS, AS WELL AS THE NEED TO UNDERTAKE IRREVERSIBLE INVESTMENTS TO SET UP WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITIES. FURTHERMORE, IT CONSIDERS SEDIMENT RELEASE OF PHOSPHORUS AS A FUNCTION OF ANNUAL NUTRIENT LOADS. THE MODEL IS PARAMETERIZED FOR A 30 KM WIDE AREA OFF THE FINNISH COAST OF THE GULF OF FINLAND. THE SOCIALLY OPTIMAL POLICY, WHICH MINIMIZES THE SUM OF MONETARY DAMAGE CAUSED BY EUTROPHICATION AND THE COSTS OF NUTRIENT ABATEMENT OVER TIME, IS DETERMINED USING A DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING APPROACH. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENTS ARE WARRANTED TO BRING WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITIES UP TO DATE. CONTINUED EFFORTS TO REDUCE AGRICULTURAL NUTRIENT LOADING ARE NEVERTHELESS ALSO CALLED FOR.

WE HAVE DEVELOPED A PRACTICAL APPROACH TO REMOVE THESE ERRORS USING ADVANCED VERY HIGH RESOLUTION RADIOMETER (AVHRR) AND MODERATE RESOLUTION IMAGING SPECTRO RADIOMETER (MODIS) I KM RESOLUTION DATA. THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF SST ANOMALY ESTIMATES IN THE FLORIDA KEYS AND TO PROVIDE THE BEST QUALITY (IN PARTICULAR, HIGH TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTIONS) SST DATA PRODUCTS FOR THIS REGION. AFTER MANUAL NAVIGATION OF OVER 47 000 AVHRR IMAGES (1993 2005), WE IMPLEMENTED A CLOUD FILTERING TECHNIQUE THAT DIFFERS FROM PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED IMAGE PROCESSING METHODS. THE FILTER USED A 12 YEAR CLIMATOLOGY AND +/ 3 DAY RUNNING SST STATISTICS TO FLAG CLOUD CONTAMINATED PIXELS. COMPARISON WITH CONCURRENT (+/ 0.5 H) DATA FROM THE SEAKEYS IN SITU STATIONS IN THE FLORIDA KEYS SHOWED NEAR ZERO BIAS ERRORS (< 0.05 DEGREES C) IN THE WEEKLY ANOMALY FOR SST ANOMALIES BETWEEN 3 DEGREES C AND 3 DEGREES C, WITH STANDARD DEVIATIONS < 0.5 DEGREES C. THE CLOUD FILTER WAS IMPLEMENTED USING INTERACTIVE DATA LANGUAGE FOR NEAR REAL TIME PROCESSING OF AVHRR AND MODIS DATA. THE IMPROVED SST PRODUCTS WERE USED TO DETECT SST ANOMALIES AND TO ESTIMATE DEGREE HEATING WEEKS (DHWS) TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL FOR CORAL REEF STRESS. THE MEAN AND ANOMALY PRODUCTS ARE UPDATED WEEKLY, WITH PERIODIC UPDATES OF THE DHW PRODUCTS, ON A WEB SITE. THE SST DATA AT SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATIONS WERE ALSO AUTOMATICALLY INGESTED IN NEAR REAL TIME INTO NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATIONS (NOAA) INTEGRATED CORAL OBSERVING NETWORK WEB BASED APPLICATION TO ASSIST IN MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING THROUGH A NOVEL EXPERT SYSTEM TOOL (G2) IMPLEMENTED AT NOAA.	***

THESE DECISIONS, SUCH AS WHETHER OR NOT TO RESTRICT PUBLIC ACCESS TO A WATER RESOURCE AREA, MAY THEREFORE VARY DEPENDING ON HOW MODELS REFLECT PROCESS, OBSERVATION, AND ANALYTICAL UNCERTAINTY AND VARIABILITY. NONETHELESS, FEW PROBABILISTIC MODELING TOOLS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED WHICH EXPLICITLY PROPAGATE FECAL INDICATOR BACTERIA (FIB) ANALYSIS UNCERTAINTY INTO PREDICTIVE BACTERIAL WATER QUALITY MODEL PARAMETERS AND RESPONSE VARIABLES. HERE, WE COMPARE THREE APPROACHES TO MODELING VARIABILITY IN TWO DIFFERENT FIB WATER QUALITY MODELS. WE FIRST CALIBRATE A WELL KNOWN FIRST ORDER BACTERIAL DECAY MODEL USING APPROACHES RANGING FROM ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES (OLS) LINEAR REGRESSION TO BAYESIAN MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO (MCMC) PROCEDURES. WE THEN CALIBRATE A LESS FREQUENTLY USED EMPIRICAL BACTERIAL DIE OFF MODEL USING THE SAME RANGE OF PROCEDURES (AND THE SAME DATA). FINALLY, WE PROPOSE AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO EVALUATING THE PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE OF EACH CALIBRATED MODEL USING A LEAVE ONE OUT CROSS VALIDATION PROCEDURE AND ASSESSING THE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE RESULTING BAYESIAN POSTERIOR PREDICTIVE P VALUES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO ACKNOWLEDGING UNCERTAINTY CAN LEAD TO DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN PARAMETER MEAN AND VARIANCE ESTIMATES AND PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE FOR THE SAME FIB WATER QUALITY MODEL. OUR RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THAT MODELS WITHOUT A BACTERIAL KINETICS PARAMETER RELATED TO THE RATE OF DECAY MAY MORE APPROPRIATELY REFLECT FIB FATE AND TRANSPORT PROCESSES, REGARDLESS OF HOW VARIABILITY AND UNCERTAINTY ARE ACKNOWLEDGED.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYZE TRENDS IN SEVERAL HYDROCLIMATIC VARIABLES IN THE RAPIDLY URBANIZING SEMI ARID SAN ANTONIO RIVER BASIN, PARTICULARLY TRENDS IN FRESHWATER INFLOWS TO THE GUADALUPE ESTUARY. SEASONAL TIME SERIES FOR 27 HYDROCLIMATIC VARIABLES FROM NINE USGS STREAM GAUGING STATIONS AND FIVE NCDC WEATHER STATIONS WERE ANALYZED FOR TREND USING THE MANN KENDALL NON PARAMETRIC TEST AFTER REMOVING SERIAL AND CROSS CORRELATIONS. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DETECTED TRENDS WAS ANALYZED USING A PERMUTATION METHOD. VARIABILITY IN TOTAL ANNUAL AND SEASONAL PRECIPITATION WAS CHARACTERIZED AND THE EFFECT OF PRECIPITATION ON REGIONAL STREAMFLOW TRENDS DURING COINCIDING PERIODS WAS ANALYZED. RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS REVEALED A DEFINITIVE LINE JUST BELOW THE CITY OF SAN ANTONIO ABOVE WHICH THE INFLUENCE OF THE INCREASE IN IMPERMEABLE SURFACES CAN BE CLEARLY SEEN. ABOVE THIS LINE NEARLY ALL SIGNIFICANT TRENDS WERE NEGATIVE (DECREASING). THE PERCENT CONTRIBUTION OF BASEFLOW TO TOTAL STREAMFLOW IN THE UPPER WATERSHED DECREASED FOR ALMOST EVERY SEASON FOR AVERAGE, HIGH, AND LOW PRECIPITATION EVENTS. BELOW THIS LINE ALL SIGNIFICANT TRENDS WERE POSITIVE (INCREASING). A GREATER NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT TRENDS WAS SEEN IN ALL HYDROCLIMATIC VARIABLES DURING ALL SEASONS AT STATIONS IN THE LOWER WATERSHED AND THE PERCENT CONTRIBUTION OF BASEFLOW TO STREARNFLOW IS INCREASING ACROSS MOST SEASONS FOR AVERAGE, HIGH, AND LOW PRECIPITATION. SOME SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE TRENDS WERE FOUND IN PRECIPITATION, BUT ONLY IN THE WINTER SEASON AND WITH NO SIGNIFICANT SPATIAL PATTERN. STREAMFLOW HAS BEEN INCREASING AT THE OUTLET OF THE WATERSHED, HOWEVER, FRESHWATER INFLOW CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THIS WATERSHED ARE ONLY BEING MET DURING YEARS THAT HAVE HIGHER THAN AVERAGE PRECIPITATION.

IN THE DANSHUI ESTUARY, MANGROVE DOMINATED BY KANDELIA CANDEL IS THE MAJOR VEGETATION, AND A LARGE AREA OF MARSH WITH FRESHWATER GRASSES HAS BEEN PROTECTED IN THREE RESERVES ALONG THE RIVER SHORE. THIS STUDY APPLIED SATELLITE IMAGERY FROM DIFFERENT REMOTE SENSORS OF VARIOUS RESOLUTIONS FOR SPECTRAL ANALYSIS IN ORDER TO COMPARE SHIFTING WETLAND VEGETATION COMMUNITIES AT DIFFERENT TIMES. A TWO STAGE ANALYTICAL PROCESS WAS USED FOR EXTRACTING VEGETATION AREA AND TYPES. IN THE FIRST STAGE, A NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX (NDVI) WAS ADOPTED TO ANALYZE SPOT, LANDSAT, AND QUICKBIRD IMAGERY TO OBTAIN THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF VEGETATION COVERS. IN THE SECOND STAGE, A MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD CLASSIFICATION (MLC) PROGRAM WAS USED TO CLASSIFY MANGROVE AND NON MANGROVE AREAS. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF MANGROVES EXPANDED 15.18 AND 40 HA IN TWO MONITORING SITES IN 10 YEARS, DEMONSTRATING THE SUCCESS OF ESTABLISHING RESERVES FOR PROTECTING MANGROVE HABITATS. THE ANALYTICAL RESULTS ALSO INDICATED THAT SATELLITE IMAGERY CAN EASILY DISCERN THE DIFFERENCE IN CHARACTERISTICS BETWEEN IMAGERY OF MANGROVE AND OTHER VEGETATION TYPES, AND THAT THE LOGISTICAL DISADVANTAGES OF MONITORING LONG TERM VEGETATION COMMUNITY CHANGES AS WELL AS EVALUATING AN INACCESSIBLE AREA MAY BE OVERCOME BY APPLYING REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES.

MANAGEMENT EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE HYPOXIC ZONE IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND IMPROVE THE WATER QUALITY OF RIVERS AND STREAMS COULD BENEFIT FROM TARGETING NUTRIENT REDUCTIONS TOWARD WATERSHEDS WITH THE HIGHEST NUTRIENT YIELDS DELIVERED TO SENSITIVE DOWNSTREAM WATERS. ONE CHALLENGE IS THAT MOST CONVENTIONAL WATERSHED MODELING APPROACHES (E.G., MECHANISTIC MODELS) USED IN THESE MANAGEMENT DECISIONS DO NOT CONSIDER UNCERTAINTIES IN THE PREDICTIONS OF NUTRIENT YIELDS AND THEIR DOWNSTREAM DELIVERY. THE INCREASING USE OF PARAMETER ESTIMATION PROCEDURES TO STATISTICALLY ESTIMATE MODEL COEFFICIENTS, HOWEVER, ALLOWS UNCERTAINTIES IN THESE PREDICTIONS TO BE RELIABLY ESTIMATED. HERE, WE USE A ROBUST BOOTSTRAPPING PROCEDURE APPLIED TO THE RESULTS OF A PREVIOUS APPLICATION OF THE HYBRID STATISTICAL/MECHANISTIC WATERSHED MODEL SPARROW (SPATIALLY REFERENCED REGRESSION ON WATERSHED ATTRIBUTES) TO DEVELOP A STATISTICALLY RELIABLE METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING HIGH PRIORITY AREAS FOR MANAGEMENT, BASED ON A PROBABILISTIC RANKING OF DELIVERED NUTRIENT YIELDS FROM WATERSHEDS THROUGHOUT A BASIN. THE METHOD IS DESIGNED TO BE USED BY MANAGERS TO PRIORITIZE WATERSHEDS WHERE ADDITIONAL STREAM MONITORING AND EVALUATIONS OF NUTRIENT REDUCTION STRATEGIES COULD BE UNDERTAKEN. OUR RANKING PROCEDURE INCORPORATES INFORMATION ON THE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS OF MODEL PREDICTIONS AND THE CORRESPONDING WATERSHED RANKINGS OF THE DELIVERED NUTRIENT YIELDS. FROM THIS QUANTIFIED UNCERTAINTY, WE ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITY THAT INDIVIDUAL WATERSHEDS ARE AMONG A COLLECTION OF WATERSHEDS THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST DELIVERED NUTRIENT YIELDS. WE ILLUSTRATE THE APPLICATION OF THE PROCEDURE TO 818 EIGHT DIGIT HYDROLOGIC UNIT CODE WATERSHEDS IN THE MISSISSIPPI/ATCHAFALAYA RIVER BASIN BY IDENTIFYING 150 WATERSHEDS HAVING THE HIGHEST DELIVERED NUTRIENT YIELDS TO THE GULF OF MEXICO. HIGHEST DELIVERED YIELDS WERE FROM WATERSHEDS IN THE CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI, OHIO, AND LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER BASINS. WITH 90% CONFIDENCE, ONLY A FEW WATERSHEDS CAN BE RELIABLY PLACED INTO THE HIGHEST 150 CATEGORY; HOWEVER, MANY MORE WATERSHEDS CAN BE REMOVED FROM CONSIDERATION AS NOT BELONGING TO THE HIGHEST 150 CATEGORY. RESULTS FROM THIS RANKING PROCEDURE PROVIDE ROBUST INFORMATION ON WATERSHED NUTRIENT YIELDS THAT CAN BENEFIT MANAGEMENT EFFORTS TO REDUCE NUTRIENT LOADINGS TO DOWNSTREAM COASTAL WATERS, SUCH AS THE GULF OF MEXICO, OR TO LOCAL RECEIVING STREAMS AND RESERVOIRS.	***

WE PROPOSE A MECHANISTIC MODEL IN WHICH PARTICLES ARE EJECTED BY RAINDROPS FROM SURFACE CAVITIES AND TRAVEL LATERALLY AT THE VELOCITY OF THE OVERLAND FLOW UNTIL THEY ARE RECAPTURED. IN THE MODEL, CAVITIES OF DIFFERING DEPTH AND DIAMETER HAVE DIFFERENT EJECTION RATES. THE MODEL HAS A SIMILAR FORM TO MULTIPLE RATE MASS TRANSFER MODELS MORE COMMONLY USED TO SIMULATE SOLUTE TRANSPORT IN GROUNDWATER. AN ANALYTICAL SOLUTION FOR A MODEL CONSISTING OF TWO POSSIBLE CAVITY GEOMETRIES IS FIT TO BREAKTHROUGH CURVES FROM SEDIMENT WASH OFF EXPERIMENTS. THE EXPERIMENTS ARE CONDUCTED ON A 0.8 M FLUME UNDER ARTIFICIAL RAINFALL WITH A SURFACE CONSTRUCTED OF CASTS OF ASPHALT. THE EXPERIMENTS USE FINE SAND (SIMILAR TO 250 MU M) AND RAINFALL RATES EQUIVALENT TO THAT FROM A 2 YEAR, 5 MIN STORM IN NON COASTAL REGIONS OF THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. MODEL PARAMETERS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO SPECIFIC PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE SURFACE CAVITIES, PARTICLES, OR RAINFALL RATE AND CAN BE DETERMINED WITH LIMITED CALIBRATION. AT THE PLOT SCALE, THE MODEL REPLICATES AN INITIAL FIRST FLUSH AND THEN SETTLES TO A MORE GRADUAL LOSS RATE WHICH IS NOTICEABLY DIFFERENT FROM THE MORE RAPID MASS EXHAUSTION IMPLIED BY USE OF THE COMMON EXPONENTIAL WASH OFF MODEL.

THE QUESTIONNAIRE IS EVALUATED BY THE 5 POINT SCALE OF SEMANTIC DIFFERENTIAL (SD) METHOD. WITH PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA), THE FOLLOWING FOUR PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ARE EXTRACTED AND NAMED AS PRINCIPAL COMPONENT LOADINGS: HARMONY, SAFETY, RURALITY, AND SPATIALITY. ALL BEACHES ARE CLASSIFIED INTO THE 4 GROUPS BY CLUSTER ANALYSIS. BY PLOTTING SCORES OF THEIR PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS IN A 2 DIMENSIONAL SEMANTIC SPACE, THE AESTHETIC CHARACTERISTICS OF COASTAL LANDSCAPE ARE CLARIFIED FOR EVERY BEACH. TO CLARIFY THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT SCORES AND THE SD SCORES OF PREFERENCE ITEMS, MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED. THEREFORE, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS AND THE PREFERENCE TRENDS OF COASTAL LANDSCAPE WILL BE ASCERTAINED.

IT OFTEN HAS ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE EFFECTS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE INPUT WATER IS PUMPED DIRECTLY FROM THE SEA VIA INTAKE PIPELINES. HOWEVER, IT IS GENERALLY MORE EFFICIENT AND CHEAPER TO DESALT BRACKISH GROUNDWATER FROM BEACH WELLS RATHER THAN DESALTING SEAWATER. NATURAL ATTENUATION IS ALSO GAINED AND HAZARDS DUE TO ANTHROPOGENIC POLLUTION OF SEAWATER ARE REDUCED. IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE ALLOCATION AND OPERATIONAL COSTS AND IMPACTS ON GROUNDWATER RESOURCES, AN OPTIMUM PUMPING NETWORK IS REQUIRED. OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES ARE OFTEN APPLIED TO THIS END. BECAUSE OF AQUIFER HETEROGENEITY, DESIGNING THE OPTIMUM PUMPING NETWORK DEMANDS RELIABLE CHARACTERIZATIONS OF AQUIFER PARAMETERS. AN OPTIMUM PUMPING NETWORK IN A COASTAL AQUIFER IN OMAN, WHERE A DESALINATION PLANT CURRENTLY PUMPS BRACKISH GROUNDWATER AT A RATE OF 1200 M(3)/H FOR A FRESHWATER PRODUCTION OF 504 M(3)/H (INSUFFICIENT TO SATISFY THE GROWING DEMAND IN THE AREA) WAS DESIGNED USING STOCHASTIC INVERSE MODELING TOGETHER WITH OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES. THE MONTE CARLO ANALYSIS OF 200 SIMULATIONS OF TRANSMISSIVITY AND STORAGE COEFFICIENT FIELDS CONDITIONED TO THE RESPONSE TO STRESSES OF TIDAL FLUCTUATION AND THREE LONG TERM PUMPING TESTS WAS PERFORMED. THESE SIMULATIONS ARE PHYSICALLY PLAUSIBLE AND FIT THE AVAILABLE DATA WELL. SIMULATED TRANSMISSIVITY FIELDS ARE USED TO DESIGN THE OPTIMUM PUMPING CONFIGURATION REQUIRED TO INCREASE THE CURRENT PUMPING RATE TO 9000 M(3)/H, FOR A FRESHWATER PRODUCTION OF 3346 M(3)/H (MORE THAN SIX TIMES LARGER THAN THE EXISTING ONE). FOR THIS TASK, NEW PUMPING WELLS NEED TO BE SITED AND THEIR PUMPING RATES DEFINED. THESE UNKNOWNS ARE DETERMINED BY A GENETIC ALGORITHM THAT MINIMIZES A FUNCTION ACCOUNTING FOR: (1) DRILLING, OPERATIONAL AND MAINTENANCE COSTS, (2) TARGET DISCHARGE AND MINIMUM DRAWDOWN (I.E., MINIMUM AQUIFER VULNERABILITY) AND (3) TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE SOLUTION. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OPTIMUM PUMPING NETWORK IS COMPARED TO THAT OF A SYNTHETIC, TRADITION BASED HAND DELINEATED DESIGN. WHERE OPTIMIZATION IS NOT PERFORMED. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE COMBINED USE OF STOCHASTIC INVERSE MODELING AND OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES LEADS TO MINIMUM SIDE EFFECTS (E.G., DRAWDOWNS IN THE AREA ARE REDUCED SUBSTANTIALLY) AND TO A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF ALLOCATION AND OPERATIONAL COSTS.

IN AN URBAN COAL MINING AREA IN THE EMSCHER AND RHINE BASIN OF NORTHWESTERN GERMANY THE GROUNDWATER TABLE RISES RELATIVE TO SUBSIDING GROUND AND THREATENS LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND BASEMENTS OF BUILDINGS. THE ACTIVE EXTRACTION SYSTEM, WHICH CONSISTS OF ONE HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE HORIZONTAL AND TWELVE VERTICAL WELLS THAT PUMP MORE THAN 500 M(3)/H, IS REVISED BY COMBINING GROUNDWATER MODEL AND ALGORITHMIC OPTIMIZATION PROCEDURE. BY CAPITALIZING ON THE ROBUSTNESS AND SELF ADAPTIVITY OF EVOLUTION STRATEGIES, BOTH FIXED AND MOVING WELL FORMULATIONS ARE SOLVED. IT IS SHOWN THAT WELL LAYOUT CAN BE IMPROVED BY AUTOMATIC OPTIMIZATION EVEN THOUGH IT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY SOUNDLY CONFIGURED BY EXPERTS. THE TOTAL PUMPING EFFORT CAN BE NOTICEABLY REDUCED WHILE COMPLYING WITH THE DRAWDOWN TARGETS GIVEN AT 24 DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE STUDY AREA. SAVINGS INCREASE IF NEW WELL POSITIONS ARE CONSIDERED. FOR EXAMPLE, ONE ADDITIONAL WELL YIELDS A 9% REDUCTION OF THE TOTAL EXTRACTION RATE. WE ALSO INVESTIGATE THE RELEVANCE OF THE SPATIALLY VARIABLE DRAWDOWN TARGETS AND DEMONSTRATE HOW THOSE TARGETS THAT MAINLY CONTROL THE OPTIMIZED WELL LAYOUTS CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY VARYING THE PENALTY FUNCTION. IT IS REVEALED THAT THERE IS HUGE POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONALLY REDUCING THE EXTRACTION RATE IF ONE OR MORE OF THESE INDIVIDUAL TARGETS COULD BE RESIGNED, FOR EXAMPLE AS A RESULT OF TECHNICAL CONSTRUCTION OR LAND USE CHANGES. A REDUCTION OF MORE THAN 25% HAS BEEN ESTIMATED FOR GIVING UP THE MOST NOTABLE CONSTRAINING TARGET. THIS WAY, BY TESTING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF GIVEN CONSTRAINTS, ALGORITHMIC OPTIMIZATION MAY GUIDE THE RE FORMULATION OF THE ORIGINAL OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM IN ORDER TO CONCEIVE NEW GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT SCENARIOS THAT ULTIMATELY LEAD TO AN INCREASED EFFICIENCY OF THE WELL FIELD. THIS PROCEDURE IS SIMILAR TO A CHANCE CONSTRAINT APPROACH, EFFICIENT WITH CMA ES. BUT CAN BE ADOPTED IN ANY OTHER COMBINED HYDROLOGICAL SIMULATION OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM. (C) 2008 ELSEVIER B.V.

WE SUGGEST TO CONSIDER COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS IN A BROAD INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK WHEN DECISIONS ARE TO BE MADE ON COASTAL DEFENCE STRATEGIES.

NATIONAL FLOOD POLICY WAS REVISED IN 1994 TO FOCUS ON LIMITING AND REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF DEVELOPMENT INSIDE THE 100 YEAR FLOODPLAIN, WITH THE GOAL OF DECREASING FLOOD LOSSES, WHICH CAN BE MEASURED AND QUANTIFIED IN TERMS OF POPULATION AND PROPERTY VALUE INSIDE THE 100 YEAR FLOODPLAIN. MONITORING CHANGES IN THESE MEASURABLE INDICATORS CAN INFORM WHERE AND HOW EFFECTIVE NATIONAL FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN. NATIONAL FLOOD POLICIES ARE RESTRICTED TO THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF THE 100 YEAR FLOODPLAIN, THUS THERE ARE NO DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS TO PROTECT AGAINST FLOODING ADJACENT TO THIS BOUNDARY. NO CONSISTENT MONITORING HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF FLOOD POLICY ON DEVELOPMENT IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE 100 YEAR FLOODPLAIN. WE DEVELOPED A STANDARDIZED METHODOLOGY, WHICH LEVERAGED NATIONAL DATA TO QUANTIFY CHANGES IN POPULATION AND BUILDING TAX VALUE (EXPOSURE). WE APPLIED THIS APPROACH TO COUNTIES IN NORTH CAROLINA TO ASSESS (1) TEMPORAL CHANGES, BEFORE AND AFTER THE 1994 POLICY AND (2) SPATIAL CHANGES, INSIDE AND ADJACENT TO THE 100 YEAR FLOODPLAIN. TEMPORAL RESULTS INDICATE THE PIEDMONT AND MOUNTAIN REGION HAD LIMITED SUCCESS AT REDUCING EXPOSURE WITHIN THE 100 YEAR FLOODPLAIN, WHILE THE COASTAL PLAIN SUCCESSFULLY REDUCED EXPOSURE. SPATIALLY, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN EXPOSURE IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE 100 YEAR FLOODPLAIN THROUGHOUT NORTH CAROLINA. THE LACK OF CONSISTENT MONITORING HAS RESULTED IN THE CONTINUATION OF THIS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE, WHICH COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF INCREASED FLOOD LOSSES AS ANY FLOOD EVEN SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE 100 YEAR FLOODPLAIN WILL HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE IMPACT SINCE DEVELOPMENT IS OUTSIDE THE LEGAL BOUNDARY OF NATIONAL FLOOD POLICY.	***

WHITE THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF 8180 IN GROUNDWATER SHOWED THAT MOST OF THE HEAVY ISOTOPEDEPLETED SAMPLES (FROM 5.7 PARTS PER THOUSAND. TO 6.97 PARTS PER THOUSAND) WERE LOCATED IN THE HIGHER PORTION OF THE HYBLEAN MOUNTAINS, MORE POSITIVE VALUES (FROM 3.47 PARTS PER THOUSAND TO 5.67 PARTS PER THOUSAND) WERE FOUND IN THE MARGINAL AREAS. THE ISOTOPE COMPOSITION OF SUBMARINE SPRINGS WAS CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY (DELTA(18)O BETWEEN 5.67 PARTS PER THOUSAND AND +1.0 PARTS PER THOUSAND AND DELTA D BETWEEN 30 PARTS PER THOUSAND AND +5.0 PARTS PER THOUSAND) REFLECTING SEASONAL VARIATIONS AND DIFFERENT SEAWATER CONTRIBUTIONS. THE ISOTOPIC AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF COASTAL GROUNDWATER SHOWED THE PRESENCE OF A SURFICIAL AQUIFER, WHITE THE COMPOSITION OF INLAND GROUNDWATER AND BEACH SPRINGS CHARACTERIZES A DEEPER LIMESTONE AQUIFER. THE AMOUNT OF NO(3) ENTERING THE SEA FROM LAND BASED SOURCES WAS ESTIMATED TO BE >60 KG/DAY, WHICH COULD BE OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN. SINCE THE SUBMARINE GROUNDWATER MANIFESTATIONS ARE FED BY COASTAL CONTAMINATED GROUNDWATER AND RE CIRCULATED SEAWATER, ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATION ON THE FRESHWATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT IN THE REGION IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST, ESPECIALLY THEIR PROTECTION AGAINST CONTAMINANTS FROM LAND BASED SOURCES REPRESENTED BY GROWING AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES IN THE REGION.

DESPITE BEING A RARE OCCURRENCE, A TSUNAMI CAN CAUSE MASSIVE DAMAGE TO PROPERTY AND LIVELIHOOD, AND CAUSE MANY DEATHS. CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE GLOBE IS COVERED BY OCEANS, WHERE MOST SUBDUCTION ZONES THAT CAUSE EARTHQUAKES ARE LOCATED, ALL COASTAL COUNTRIES ARE IN DANGER. WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THWARTING SUCH CATASTROPHES, WE EMPHASISE THE POSSIBILITY OF REDUCING THE IMPACTS BY PROVIDING PROPER ADVANCE WARNINGS. THUS, THE PERFORMANCE OF AVAILABLE TSUNAMI DETECTION AND WARNING MECHANISMS NEEDS ONGOING REVIEW. THIS PAPER ELABORATES ON THE MODELLING, SIMULATION AND COMPARISON OF TWO PROPOSED TSUNAMI WARNING SYSTEMS FOR THE INDIAN OCEAN, AND THE EXISTING TEMPORARY WARNING SYSTEM FOR SRI LANKA. THE UNCERTAINTIES PREVALENT IN SUCH SYSTEMS ARE ALSO ADDRESSED INDICATING THEIR INFLUENCES ON THE SUCCESSFUL DISSEMINATION OF WARNINGS. IT IS SHOWN THAT A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT OF THE PROBABILITY OF ISSUING A WARNING FOR SRI LANKA WITHIN ONE HOUR, GIVEN THAT A TSUNAMI HAS BEEN INITIATED FROM AN EARTHQUAKE, CAN BE OBTAINED IF A CENTRALISED SYSTEM IS IMPLEMENTED FOR THE INDIAN OCEAN.	***

THE STATE DEPENDENT PARAMETER FORM OF THE GENERAL TRANSFER FUNCTION (SDP TF) MODEL IS USED TO DESCRIBE NONLINEARITY INFLUENCING THESE MORPHOLOGICAL DATA IN TWO CASE EXAMPLES. CASE 1 INVESTIGATES THE NONLINEARITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPENDENCY OF WAVE FORCING ON THE PRECEDING BEACH VOLUME. CASE 2 INVESTIGATES THE ABILITY TO MODEL THE VARIABLES WITHIN THE WELL KNOWN DIFFUSION EQUATION FOR BEACH VOLUME USING THIS DATA BASED APPROACH. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SHOW THAT THE SDP TF APPROACH CAN BE USED SUCCESSFULLY TO DEVELOP STATISTICALLY ROBUST MODELS FOR DESCRIBING NONLINEARITY IN BEACH MORPHOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. FURTHERMORE, THESE MODELS ARE SHOWN TO PREDICT THE BEACH VOLUMES OVER BOTH SHORT (1 MONTH AHEAD) AND LONG (2 YEARS AHEAD) TIME PERIODS, AND THUS SHOW GREAT POTENTIAL FOR PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS IN COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT AND ENGINEERING.
