GEOGRAPHICALLY, BINH THUAN, A COASTAL PROVINCE, IS LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN CENTRE AREA. CURRENTLY, NATURAL DISASTERS HAVE BECOME MORE FREQUENT, PARTICULARLY DROUGHT. DESERTIFICATION HAS BECOME MORE SERIOUS. BESIDES THE NATURAL CAUSES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THERE ARE SEVERAL AFFECTED BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES SUCH AS HIGH POPULATION AND POVERTY, INAPPROPRIATE CULTIVATING TECHNIQUE, DEFORESTATION, ILL ADOPTED LEGAL FRAMEWORK, WEAK MANAGEMENT CAPACITY, LACK OF ADEQUATE KNOWLEDGE, AND A LACK OF AWARENESS IN LOCAL POPULATION. TO ASSESS RISKS OF DESERTIFICATION FOR THE BINH THUAN PROVINCE (VIETNAM), A RISK ASSESSMENT MODEL BASED ON A LEOPOLD MATRIX WAS APPLIED. AS A RESULT, A MODEL OF CAUSE AND EFFECT SHOWED SIX DEGREES OF IMPACTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS ON THE SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS FROM VERY HIGHLY TO VERY UNLIKELY SIGNIFICANCE. RISK ASSESSMENT ALLOWS FOR A GENERAL FIGURE OF VARIOUS IMPACTS OF DESERTIFICATION ON THE SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN BINH THUAN, VIETNAM.	***

CARTOGRAPHY OF LITTORAL ROCKY SHORE COMMUNITIES (CARLIT) IS A EUROPEAN UNION WATER FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE COMPLIANT MONITORING METHOD WIDELY USED IN THE WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN SEA. THIS NON DESTRUCTIVE METHOD IS BASED ON A VISUAL OBSERVATION OF THE TYPE AND LENGTH OF COAST OCCUPIED BY ROCKY SHORE COMMUNITIES IN THE UPPER SUBLITTORAL ZONE. HERE WE PRESENT THE FIRST WIDE SCALE APPLICATION OF CARLIT IN THE ADRIATIC SEA. THE REFERENCE VALUES CALCULATED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE CROATIAN COAST (EASTERN ADRIATIC SEA) ENSURE ACCURATE CALCULATION OF THE ECOLOGICAL STATUS. THE MEASURED ECOLOGICAL QUALITY RATIO VALUES (EQR) SHOW A GOOD LINEAR RELATION WITH THE LAND USES SIMPLIFIED INDEX (LUSI) AND APPROPRIATELY REFLECT AN INCREASE IN NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THIS METHOD CAN BE USED AS A RELIABLE BIOMONITORING TOOL IN THE EASTERN ADRIATIC SEA. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTED THAT CYSTOSEIRA FORESTS THRIVE IN 39% OF THE SURVEYED COASTLINE AND 23% OF THE COASTLINE SEEMS TO BE SUBJECTED TO OVERGRAZING BY SEA URCHINS. OUR RESULTS PROVIDE A SPATIALLY ACCURATE INFORMATION ON THE ABUNDANCE OF DIFFERENT UPPER SUBLITTORAL COMMUNITIES AND THE ASSOCIATED ECOLOGICAL STATUS, WHICH CAN BE USED IN FUTURE MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR IMPROVING WATER QUALITY.

CALCULATION OF THE MULTIVARIATE AZTI MARINE BIOTIC INDEX (M AMBI) EQR IS BASED ON THE PROPORTIONS OF SENSITIVE AND STRESS TOLERANT BENTHIC INVERTEBRATE SPECIES, NUMBER OF SPECIES AND SHANNON WIENER DIVERSITY. THE SENSITIVITY OF MANY TROPICAL/SUB TROPICAL TAXA HAS NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED, PRESENTING A BARRIER TO THE DIRECT TRANSFER OF WFD EQRS, AND THE IDEAS UNDERPINNING THEM, TO THE MANAGEMENT OF COASTAL WATERS BEYOND EUROPE. TO OVERCOME THIS WE EXAMINE USING HIGHER TAXONOMIC LEVEL DATA WITH M AMBI. BEFORE APPLYING SUCH APPROACHES TO ASSESSING ES IN NEW GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS IT IS ESSENTIAL TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF USING HIGHER TAXONOMIC LEVEL DATA ON M AMBI IN AREAS WHERE THE TOOL WAS DEVELOPED. TO THIS END, WE USE MACROFAUNAL DATA FROM THREE WELL STUDIED SITES IN NORTH WESTERN EUROPE TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF USING TAXONOMIC LEVEL DATA HIGHER THAN SPECIES ON M AMBI. USING THE EUROPEAN DATASETS M AMBI ES CLASSIFICATION WAS SHOWN TO BE ROBUST TO CHANGES IN TAXONOMIC LEVEL DATA. WE TEST THE SUITABILITY OF FAMILY LEVEL M AMBI FOR ASSESSING ES IN SUBTROPICAL HONG KONG WATERS. FAMILY LEVEL M AMBI WAS USEFUL IN DETECTING STRESS IN HONG KONG, WHERE IT SUCCESSFULLY DETECTED TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL SHIFTS IN ES IN RESPONSE TO SEASONAL HYPOXIA AND SALINITY VARIABILITY, AND ANTHROPOGENIC ORGANIC ENRICHMENT.

ALONG WITH HUMAN EXPLOITATIVE USES COMES AN ARRAY OF ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES THAT CAN AFFECT ECOLOGICAL INTEGRITY, INCLUDING CHANGES TO THE COMPOSITION AND RESILIENCE OF BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES. TO UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSES OF ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES TO ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE AND TO MANAGE AND MITIGATE EFFECTS, INDICES FOR ASSESSING THE ECOLOGICAL INTEGRITY OF ESTUARINE AND COASTAL WATERS HAVE PROLIFERATED WORLDWIDE. USING DATA FROM 84 INTERTIDAL SITES IN AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND, WE EVALUATED THE SUITABILITY OF TWO WIDELY USED MEASURES OF ECOLOGICAL INTEGRITY THAT WERE DEVELOPED IN USA AND EUROPE, RESPECTIVELY: THE BENTHIC INDEX OF BIOTIC INTEGRITY (B IBI) AND THE AZTIS MARINE BIOTIC INDEX (AMBI). WE THEN DEVELOPED A LOCAL INDEX BASED ON MACROFAUNAL TRAITS AND VERIFIED ITS UTILITY USING INDEPENDENT DATA FROM >100 ADDITIONAL SITES. THE LOCAL TRAITS BASED INDEX (TBI), CONSTRUCTED FROM THE RICHNESS OF MACROFAUNAL TAXA IN SEVEN FUNCTIONAL GROUPS, RESPONDED TO CHANGES IN SEDIMENT MUD PERCENTAGE AND HEAVY METAL CONTAMINANT CONCENTRATION GRADIENTS BELOW INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES. THE TBI PERFORMED BETTER THAN THE INDICES DEVELOPED OVERSEAS, PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY WERE DESIGNED TO TRACK ORGANIC ENRICHMENT AND HYPOXIA, WHICH ARE NOT THE PREDOMINANT STRESSORS IN NEW ZEALAND AT PRESENT. THE TBI SUCCESSFULLY TRACKED THE STRESSORS THAT WERE THE MOST RELEVANT LOCALLY AND INDICATED THE RELATIVE LEVELS OF WITHIN GROUP TAXONOMIC RICHNESS AT VARIOUS SITES. AS WITHIN GROUP RICHNESS IS A COMPONENT OF FUNCTIONAL REDUNDANCY AND ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE, THE TBI OFFERS A TRIFECTA OF SIMPLICITY, ROBUSTNESS AND MEANINGFULNESS THAT WILL FACILITATE MANAGEMENT.

HAZARDS) AND TRIBE SPECIFIC VULNERABILITY FACTORS (SOCIOECONOMIC, POLITICAL, INFRASTRUCTURAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, SPIRITUAL AND CULTURAL), WHICH WHEN COMBINED WITH HAZARDS LEAD TO IMPACTS. NEXT REGIONAL SUMMARIES OF IMPACTS AROUND THE U.S. ARE DISCUSSED. ALTHOUGH EACH TRIBAL COMMUNITY EXPERIENCES UNIQUE SETS OF IMPACTS BECAUSE OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL HISTORY, CULTURE, AND GEOGRAPHIC SETTING, MANY OF THE OBSERVED IMPACTS ARE COMMON AMONG DIFFERENT GROUPS AND CAN BE CATEGORIZED AS IMPACTS ON 1) WATER SUPPLY AND MANAGEMENT (INCLUDING WATER SOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE), 2) AQUATIC SPECIES IMPORTANT FOR CULTURE AND SUBSISTENCE, 3) RANCHING AND AGRICULTURE PARTICULARLY FROM CLIMATE EXTREMES (E.G., DROUGHTS, FLOODS), 4) TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY AND RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH WATER RESOURCES, FISHING, HUNTING, AND GATHERING, AND 5) SOIL QUALITY (E.G., FROM COASTAL AND RIVERINE EROSION PROMPTING TRIBAL RELOCATION OR FROM DROUGHT RELATED LAND DEGRADATION). THE PAPER FINISHES BY HIGHLIGHTING POTENTIALLY RELEVANT RESEARCH QUESTIONS BASED ON THE FIVE IMPACT CATEGORIES.	***

THE LONG HISTORY OF RESPONSES TO COASTAL CHANGE CAN BE LINKED TO THE HISTORY OF COASTAL ENGINEERING, THE WIDER DEVELOPMENT OF COASTAL MANAGEMENT; AND MOST RECENTLY SHORELINE MANAGEMENT, AS A POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING FLOOD AND EROSION RISKS ON CHANGING COASTS. COASTAL CHANGE IS ONGOING AND LONG TERM SO THAT MANAGEMENT IS NECESSARILY A PROCESS AND EFFECTIVE DELIVERY REQUIRES AN ADEQUATE MONITORING PROGRAMME TO INFORM MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. MONITORING ALSO ENABLES ADAPTIVE AND FLEXIBLE SOLUTIONS TO BE IMPLEMENTED THAT TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES SUCH AS FUTURE CLIMATE, PROMOTING WELL ADAPTED RATHER THAN MAL ADAPTED OUTCOMES. GIVEN THE CURRENT CONCERNS ABOUT ACCELERATED RATES OF SEA LEVEL RISE AND CLIMATE CHANGE THIS PAPER CONSIDERS THE DEVELOPMENT OF BOTH SHORELINE MANAGEMENT AND THE SUPPORTING NATIONAL MONITORING PROGRAMME IN ENGLAND TO ASSESS WHETHER THE SMP PROCESS REMAINS USEFUL IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE LESSONS AND EXPERIENCE ARE WIDELY TRANSFERABLE. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

IN TERMS OF INTEGRATED COASTAL/OCEAN PROCESSES MODELING, TWO CASE STUDIES ARE PRESENTED: THE FIRST ONE IS TO PREDICT FLOODING/INUNDATION AND EROSION IN A SMALL SCALE ESTUARY IN TAIWAN INDUCED BY A SET OF SLR SCENARIOS AND LOCAL EXTREME HYDROLOGICAL FORCING, WHICH INCLUDES WAVES, TIDES, RIVER FLOODS, AND SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; THE SECOND CASE AIMS AT SIMULATING LARGE SCALE HYDRODYNAMIC RESPONSES (I.E. WAVES AND STORM SURGES) TO SLR AND A HURRICANE IN A REGION SCALE DOMAIN COVERING THE NORTHERN GULF COAST. THE MODEL IS VALIDATED BY SIMULATING WAVES, STORM SURGES AND MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES BY USING LOCAL HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. PREDICTION RESULTS SHOW THAT THE VARIATIONS OF WATER SURFACE ELEVATIONS, WAVES, AND MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES ARE GENERALLY NOT LINEARLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE STATIC SLR; THE RATES OF THEIR VARIABLE CHANGES ARE VARYING WITH LOCATION AND TOPOGRAPHY/BATHYMETRY. TO DEAL WITH NONLINEAR FEATURES IN UNSTEADY AND MULTISCALE HYDRODYNAMIC AND MORPHODYNAMIC PROCESSES IN COASTS AND OCEANS, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ADOPT THIS INTEGRATED PROCESS MODELING APPROACH FOR COASTAL HAZARD MANAGEMENT IN RESPONSE TO LOCAL SLR.

ASSESSMENT OF HYDROGEOCHEMISTY OF GROUNDWATER RESOURCES IN SHRIMP FARMING AREAS IS VERY MUCH REQUIRED NOT ONLY FOR MONITORING THE SHRIMP FARMING IMPACTS, BUT ALSO TO SUGGEST BETTER MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF SHRIMP FARMING AND INTEGRATED WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT IN COASTAL REGIONS. WATERSHED BASED ASSESSMENT IS IDEAL AS WATERSHED IS A GEOHYDROLOGICAL UNIT, AND IT WILL GIVE THE REALISTIC AND CUMULATIVE EFFECTS MORE PRECISELY. WITH THIS BACKGROUND, THE PRESENT INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT TO EVALUATE THE GEOCHEMICAL PROCESS REGULATING GROUNDWATER QUALITY IN SHRIMP FARMING AREAS OF COASTAL MINIWATERSHEDS OF VELLAR AND COLEROON RIVER, CUDDALORE DISTRICT, TAMIL NADU, ALONG THE EAST COAST OF INDIA. REPRESENTATIVE GROUNDWATER (29) SAMPLES FROM SHALLOW AQUIFER (HAND PUMP AND OPEN WELL) WERE COLLECTED PERIODICALLY (JUNE 2008, JANUARY 2009, APRIL 2009 AND JULY 2009) USING THE SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD AND ANALYZED FOR VARIOUS WATER QUALITY PARAMETERS VIZ. PH, TDS, TOTAL HARDNESS, ALKALINITY, CATIONS (CA+, MG+, NA+) AND ANIONS (CL , SO4 ( ), NO3 ( ), HCO3 ( )). THE GROUNDWATER DATA INDICATED THAT THE HCO3 WAS THE DOMINANT ION IN THE STUDY AREA WITH SODIUM (NA > CA > MG) AND BICARBONATE (HCO3 > CL > SO4) AS THE PREDOMINANT CATION AND ANION, RESPECTIVELY. THE LARGE VARIATIONS IN MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION OF IONIC CONCENTRATION SUGGEST THAT THE WATER CHEMISTRY IN THE STUDY REGION WAS NOT HOMOGENOUS AND MAY BE INFLUENCED BY COMPLEX SOURCES FOR THE HYDROGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES. THE PIPER TRILINEAR DIAGRAM DEPICTS THE STATUS OF THE GROUNDWATER QUALITY AND ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THE CATION EXCHANGE AND MINERAL DISSOLUTION WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ELEVATED IONIC COMPOSITION AT SOME LOCATIONS IN THE STUDY AREA. THE MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS VIZ., PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS AND CLUSTER ANALYSIS CLEARLY ELUCIDATED THAT THE GROUNDWATER QUALITY IN THE AREA IS MAINLY DUE TO NATURAL PROCESS AND THE SHRIMP FARMING IS NOT AN INFLUENCING FACTOR.	***

IN TEMPERATE SOILS, THIS CHARACTERISTIC HAS BEEN USED AS AN INDICATOR OF QUALITY OF SOIL MANAGEMENT. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED WITH THIS INDICATOR IN TROPICAL AND SUBTROPICAL CLIMATES OR WITH THE MAIN SOIL ORDERS IN THESE AREAS. TO FILL THIS GAP, THIS STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN A SUBTROPICAL CLIMATE WITH TWO OF THE MAJOR BRAZILIAN SOIL ORDERS, OXISOL AND ALFISOL, THAT TOGETHER ACCOUNT FOR 63% OF BRAZILIAN AGRICULTURAL SOILS. THIS STUDY TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE CSR IS AFFECTED BY SOIL ORDER AND CLIMATE TYPE. THE MAIN TREATMENTS WERE SOIL TILLAGE AND DIFFERENT CROPPING SYSTEMS IN TWO LONG TERM EXPERIMENTS CARRIED OUT IN THE STATE OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL, BRAZIL. THE FIRST EXPERIMENT, ESTABLISHED IN 1985, WAS CONDUCTED OVER A CLAYEY HAPLUDOX (OXISOL) SOIL. THE MAIN PLOTS WERE TREATED WITH ONE OF TWO TILLAGE SYSTEMS (CONVENTIONAL TILLAGE CT; AND NO TILLAGE NT). THE SUBPLOTS WERE TREATED WITH ONE OF THREE CROPPING SYSTEMS: (A) CONTINUOUS CROP SUCCESSION (R0) WHEAT (TRITICUM AESTIVUM L.)/SOYBEAN (GLYCINE MAX L. MERRILL); (B) WINTER CROP ROTATION (R1) WHEAT/SOYBEAN/BLACK OAT (AVENA STRIGOSA SCHREBER)/SOYBEAN; (C) SUMMER AND WINTER CROP ROTATION (R2) WHEAT/SOYBEAN/BLACK OAT/SOYBEAN/BLACK OAT + COMMON VETCH (VICIA SATIVA L. WALP)/MAIZE (ZEA MAYS L.)/FORAGE RADISH (RAPHANUS SATIVUS VAR. OLEIFERUS METZG.). THE SECOND EXPERIMENT WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1991 OVER A SANDY LOAM DISTROPHIC PALEUDALF (ALFISOL) SOIL. FIVE CROPPING SYSTEMS WERE ANALYZED UNDER NO TILL: (A) MAIZE + JACK BEANS (CANAVALIA ENSIFORMIS DC)/SOYBEAN (M/JB); (B) MAIZE/FALLOW/SOYBEAN (M/F); (C) MAIZE/RYEGRASS (LOLIUM MULTIFLORUM LAM.) + COMMON VETCH/SOYBEAN (M/R); (D) MAIZE + VELVET BEANS (STIZOLOBIUM CINEREUM PIPER AND TRACY)/SOYBEAN (M/VB); AND (E) MAIZE/RADISH OIL/SOYBEAN (M/FR). THE CARBON STRATIFICATION RATIO (CSR) WAS ASSESSED IN THE 19TH AND 22ND EXPERIMENTAL YEARS FOR OXISOL AND IN THE 10TH AND 17TH YEARS FOR ALFISOL. THIS INDEX WAS CALCULATED THROUGH THE RATIO OF SOC STOCKS IN THE 0 0.05 AND 0.05 0.15 M SOIL LAYERS. THE CPI WAS DETERMINED THROUGH THE RATIO OF SOC STOCKS IN THE 0 0.15 M SOIL LAYER IN A GIVEN TREATMENT COMPARED WITH NATIVE VEGETATION. REGARDLESS OF THE SOIL ORDER, SOC WAS INFLUENCED BY C INPUT AND THE TILLAGE SYSTEM; THERE WAS A POSITIVE LINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CSR AND CPI. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CSR AND THE CARBON POOL INDEX (CPI) WAS USED TO INFER THE QUALITY OF SOIL MANAGEMENT. HIGHER CSR AND CPI INDICES WERE FOUND UNDER TREATMENTS WITH MINIMUM SOIL DISTURBANCE AND INTENSIVE CROP ROTATION. LOWER CSR AND CPI VALUES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH FREQUENT MOBILIZATION AND LOWER CROP DIVERSITY. THESE CSR INDICES SENSITIVELY DISTINGUISHED THE INTENSITY OF TILLAGE (NT REPLACING CT) AND CROPPING SYSTEMS (COVER CROPS REPLACING WINTER FALLOW OR CROP SUCCESSION). THE CSR VALUES IN SUBTROPICAL SOILS INVESTIGATED WERE LOWER THAN THOSE REPORTED FOR TEMPERATE SOILS. THE SOIL ORDER AFFECTED THE CRITICAL CSR VALUE BEING LOWER IN THE OXISOL THAN IN THE ALFISOL. OUR FINDINGS RECOMMEND ACCEPT OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT THE CSR IS AFFECTED BY CLIMATE AND SOIL ORDER. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

GROUND SURVEYED MICRO TOPOGRAPHY DATA OBTAINED USING REAL TIME KINEMATIC DIFFERENTIAL GPS WERE USED TO ANALYSE AND CORRECT THE ACCURACY OF LIDAR SOURCED ELEVATION VALUES IN MATLAB R2010A. FOLLOWING THE APPLICATION OF ELEVATION CORRECTIONS, 3 INTERPOLATION TECHNIQUES WERE APPLIED: INVERSE DISTANCE WEIGHTING (IDW), ORDINARY KRIGING (OK) AND THE DELAUNAY TRIANGULATED IRREGULAR NETWORK (TIN) INTERPOLATION. ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE TIN METHOD PRODUCED A MORE ROBUST MODEL THAT ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED THE MICROTOPOGRAPHICAL VARIATION ACROSS THE WETLAND. THE TIN ELEVATION INTERPOLATION WAS THEN USED TO CHARACTERISE THE EXTENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE PLANT COMMUNITIES USING KNOWN ELEVATION PREFERENCES IN ONE COASTAL WETLAND SITE, TAHU. THE PLANT COMMUNITY MODEL DEVELOPED FROM THE TIN ELEVATION INTERPOLATION WAS THEN FURTHER GROUND TRUTHED IN TWO SEPARATE BALTIC COASTAL WETLAND SITES, MATSALU AND KUDANI, IN ORDER TO TEST MODEL VALIDITY. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE ACCURACY OF THE LIDAR DATA VARIED DEPENDENT UPON PLANT COMMUNITY TYPE. IN 5 OF THE 6 STUDIED COMMUNITY TYPES, THE LIDAR DATA GAVE A MEAN ELEVATION DIFFERENCE OF 0.177 M (0.016 SD) ABOVE THE DGPS ELEVATIONS. WITH DGPS ELEVATION CORRECTIONS, THE LIDAR DATA PRODUCED AN ACCURATE MODEL OF THE LOCATION OF THE DIFFERENT PLANT COMMUNITY TYPES, KAPPA COEFFICIENT (KAPPA) 0.63, AT THE INITIAL SITE, TAHU. THE MODEL WAS FOUND TO BE VERY ACCURATE IN ONE OF THE SUBSEQUENT GROUND TRUTHED SITES, KAPPA 0.81, WITH A SIMILAR MANAGEMENT HISTORY, BUT LESS ACCURATE, KAPPA 0.53, IN A WETLAND MORE EXPOSED TO WAVE ACTION AND WITH A LONGER HISTORY OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. THE INCLUSION OF DGPS GROUND SURVEY DATA WAS SHOWN TO CONSIDERABLY IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF THE LIDAR ELEVATION DATA TO FACILITATE THE IDENTIFICATION OF PLANT COMMUNITY TYPES ON THE BASIS OF ELEVATION. THE APPROACH DEVELOPED IN THIS STUDY OF BALTIC COASTAL WETLANDS MAY PROVIDE A TRANSFERABLE METHOD FOR RAPIDLY AND ACCURATELY MAPPING PLANT COMMUNITIES IN OTHER OPEN ENVIRONMENTS.
