TO DEFINE THE PROPERTIES OF OVOTRANSFERRIN, A SIMPLE PROTOCOL FOR OVOTRANSFERRIN PURIFICATION WAS DEVELOPED AND A BROAD PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND IMMUNOLOGICAL ASSAY WERE USED FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION. THE PREPARED OVOTRANSFERRIN REVEALED A SINGLE BAND ON SODIUM DODECYL SULFATE POLYACRYLAMIDE GEL ELECTROPHORESIS, AND HAD AN ESTIMATED PURITY OF MORE THAN 97%. THE IDENTITY OF THE PREPARED PROTEIN IDENTIFIED BY MASS SPECTROMETRY ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED THAT IT WAS IRON FREE OVOTRANSFERRIN WITH A MOLECULAR WEIGHT OF 77,726 DA AND PI VALUE OF 6.85, RESPECTIVELY, AND ITS NATURE FOLDED STRUCTURE WAS KEPT WELL AS DEFINED BY CIRCULAR DICHROISM SPECTROSCOPY. WESTERN BLOTTING AND ENZYME LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAYS SHOWED STRONG IMMUNE REACTIONS BETWEEN THE PREPARED OVOTRANSFERRIN AND RABBIT POLYCLONAL ANTIBODY AGAINST OVOTRANSFERRIN/EGG ALLERGIC PATIENTS SERA, SUGGESTING THAT THE PREPARED OVOTRANSFERRIN BOUND TO IGG AND IGE STRONGLY. IN ADDITION, 24 OF THE POTENTIAL LINEAR IGE BINDING EPITOPES ON THE PREPARED OVOTRANSFERRIN WERE PREDICTED USING A WEB BASED ALLERGEN DATABASE FOR FOOD SAFETY. THE PREPARATION METHOD OF OVOTRANSFERRIN IN THE PRESENT WORK MIGHT PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT TO THE AUTHENTICITY OF OVOTRANSFERRIN FOR DEVELOPING CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS.	***

PREVENTIVE CONTROL DEALS WITH MODIFYING THE SYSTEM OPERATING POINT TO WITHSTAND PROBABLE CONTINGENCIES. IN THIS ARTICLE, A DECISION TREE (DT) BASED ON LINE PREVENTIVE CONTROL STRATEGY IS PROPOSED FOR TRANSIENT INSTABILITY PREVENTION OF POWER SYSTEMS. GIVEN A STABILITY DATABASE, A DISTANCE BASED FEATURE ESTIMATION ALGORITHM IS FIRST APPLIED TO IDENTIFY THE CRITICAL GENERATORS, WHICH ARE THEN USED AS FEATURES TO DEVELOP A DT. BY INTERPRETING THE SPLITTING RULES OF DT, PREVENTIVE CONTROL IS REALISED BY FORMULATING THE RULES IN A STANDARD OPTIMAL POWER FLOW MODEL AND SOLVING IT. THE PROPOSED METHOD IS TRANSPARENT IN CONTROL MECHANISM, ON LINE COMPUTATION COMPATIBLE AND CONVENIENT TO DEAL WITH MULTI CONTINGENCY. THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF THE METHOD HAS BEEN VERIFIED ON NEW ENGLAND 10 MACHINE 39 BUS TEST SYSTEM.	***

IN CLASSICAL APPROACHES, THE ALGORITHMS PROCESS A VAST DATABASE OF SMALL STRINGS. HOWEVER, IN THIS PAPER WE ANALYZE A SMALL DATABASE OF LONG STRINGS. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE RESIDES IN THE HIGH NUMBER OF PATTERNS TO ANALYZE. TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW ALGORITHM FOR DISCOVERING FREQUENT FACTORS IN LONG STRINGS. WE PRESENT AN APRIORI LIKE SOLUTION WHICH EXPLOITS THE FACT THAT ANY SUPER PATTERN OF A NON FREQUENT PATTERN CANNOT BE FREQUENT. THE SANSPOS ALGORITHM DOES A MULTIPLE PASS, CANDIDATE GENERATION AND TEST APPROACH. MULTIPLE LENGTH PATTERNS CAN BE GENERATED IN A PASS. THIS ALGORITHM USES A NEW DATA STRUCTURE TO ARRANGE NODES IN A TRIE. A POSITIONING MATRIX IS DEFINED AS A NEW POSITIONING STRATEGY. BY USING POSITIONING MATRICES, WE CAN APPLY ADVANCED PRUNE HEURISTICS IN A TRIO WITH A MINIMAL COMPUTATIONAL COST. THE POSITIONING MATRICES LET US PROCESS STRINGS INCLUDING SHORT TANDEM REPEATS AND CALCULATE DIFFERENT INTERESTINGNESS MEASURES EFFICIENTLY. FURTHERMORE, IN OUR ALGORITHM WE APPLY PARALLELISM TO TRANSVERSE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE INPUT STRINGS CONCURRENTLY, SPEEDING UP THE RESULTING RUNNING TIME. THE ALGORITHM HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY USED IN NATURAL LANGUAGE AND BIOLOGICAL SEQUENCE CONTEXTS. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

THIS OBLIGES THE USER TO DEAL WITH SIMPLE THRESHOLDS AND IMPEDES HER/HIM FROM EVALUATING THE MINED SUBGRAPHS BY DEFINING DIFFERENT GOODNESS (I.E., MULTIOBJECTIVE) CRITERIA REGARDING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SUBGRAPHS. IN PREVIOUS PAPERS, WE DEFINED A MULTIOBJECTIVE GBDM FRAMEWORK TO PERFORM BI OBJECTIVE GRAPH MINING IN TERMS OF SUB GRAPH SUPPORT AND SIZE MAXIMIZATION. TWO DIFFERENT SEARCH METHODS WERE CONSIDERED WITH THIS AIM, A MULTIOBJECTIVE BEAM SEARCH AND A MULTIOBJECTIVE EVOLUTIONARY PROGRAMMING (MOEP). IN THIS CONTRIBUTION, WE EXTEND THE LATTER FORMULATION TO A THREE OBJECTIVE FRAMEWORK BY INCORPORATING ANOTHER CLASSICAL GRAPH MINING OBJECTIVE, THE SUBGRAPH DIAMETER. THE PROPOSED MOEP METHOD FOR MULTIOBJECTIVE GBDM IS TESTED ON FIVE SYNTHETIC AND REAL WORLD DATASETS AND ITS PERFORMANCE IS COMPARED AGAINST SINGLE AND MULTIOBJECTIVE SUBGRAPH MINING APPROACHES BASED ON THE CLASSICAL SUBDUE TECHNIQUE IN GBDM. THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE APPLICATION OF MULTIOBJECTIVE SUBGRAPH MINING ALLOWS US TO DISCOVER MORE DIVERSIFIED SUBGRAPHS IN THE OBJECTIVE SPACE. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

THE RECONSTRUCTION OF GENE ASSOCIATION NETWORKS FROM GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES IS A RELEVANT TASK AND SEVERAL STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO BUILD THEM. THE PROBLEM LIES IN THE PROCESS TO DISCOVER WHICH GENES ARE MORE RELEVANT AND TO IDENTIFY THE DIRECT REGULATORY RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THEM. WE DEVELOPED A MULTI OBJECTIVE EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM FOR MINING QUANTITATIVE ASSOCIATION RULES TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM. WE APPLIED OUR METHODOLOGY NAMED GARNET TO A WELL KNOWN MICROARRAY DATA OF YEAST CELL CYCLE. THE PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF GARNET WAS ORGANIZED IN THREE STEPS SIMILARLY TO THE STUDY PERFORMED BY GALLO ET AL. GARNET OUTPERFORMED THE BENCHMARK METHODS IN MOST CASES IN TERMS OF QUALITY METRICS OF THE NETWORKS, SUCH AS ACCURACY AND PRECISION, WHICH WERE MEASURED USING YEASTNET DATABASE AS TRUE NETWORK. FURTHERMORE, THE RESULTS WERE CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS BIOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

THE DAB SERVICE PROVIDES AN EARLY, POSSIBLY ERRONEOUS, GUESS ON TRANSACTIONS FINAL SERIALIZATION ORDER. THIS CAN BE EXPLOITED TO SPECULATIVELY EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS IN PARALLEL WITH THE ALGORITHM USED TO DETERMINE THEIR FINAL TOTAL DELIVERY (AND SERIALIZATION) ORDER. TO MAXIMIZE THE CHANCES OF GUESSING THEIR FINAL SERIALIZATION ORDER, TRANSACTIONS ARE EXECUTED MULTIPLE TIMES, SPECULATING ON THE POSSIBLE ORDERINGS EVENTUALLY DETERMINED BY THE DAB SERVICE. WE FORMALIZE THE SPECULATIVE TRANSACTIONAL REPLICATION (STR) PROBLEM BY MEANS OF A SET OF PROPERTIES ENSURING THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE NEVER ACTIVATED ON INCONSISTENT SNAPSHOTS, AS WELL AS THE MINIMALITY AND COMPLETENESS OF THE SET OF SPECULATIVELY EXPLORED SERIALIZATION ORDERS.

FOR THIS, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL TRIANGULAR MULTI LOOP BRIDGE READER ANTENNA WHICH GENERATES AN ERROR SIGNAL IN THE FORM OF BRIDGE POTENTIAL THAT IS A FUNCTION OF THE TAGS LOCATION. THE PROPOSED POSITIONING ALGORITHM COMBINES THE INFORMATION FROM THE READER DATABASE WITH THE ERROR SIGNALS GENERATED BY THE BRIDGE LOOP AND COUPLES THEM WITH ANY AVAILABLE DATA FROM THE WHEEL ENCODERS OF AN AUTONOMOUSLY MOVING OBJECT TO DEDUCE ITS POSITION AND ORIENTATION. THE ACCURACY AND EFFICACY OF THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM ARE EVALUATED USING BOTH SIMULATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS USING AN AUTONOMOUS WHEELCHAIR. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE PROPOSED METHOD OFFERS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OVER EXISTING HF RFID BASED POSITIONING METHODS FOR LARGER FLOOR TAG GRID SEPARATION.	***

THE PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF THE STRAINS USING 16S RDNA SEQUENCE REVEALED THE STRAINS TO BE PSEUDOMONAS PUTIDA AND COMAMONAS SPECIES STRAIN, RESPECTIVELY. FURTHERMORE, TO DETERMINE THE MECHANISM INVOLVED IN CADMIUM RESISTANCE, A CZC GENE WAS AMPLIFIED FROM THE STRAINS AND SEQUENCED. HOMOLOGY OF THE SEQUENCES OF THE TWO STRAINS, WHEN COMPARED WITH THE AVAILABLE DATABASE USING A BLASTN SEARCH, SHOWED THAT THE 650BP AMPLICONS POSSESS A PARTIAL CZCA GENE SEQUENCE. MOREOVER, THE MECHANISM WAS CONFIRMED BY THE RESULTS OF ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY AND TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY STUDIES, WHICH SUPPORTED THE EFFLUX MECHANISM IN THE ALKALOPHILIC STRAIN SB20, BUT THE ACIDOPHILIC STRAIN SB21 SHOWED INTRACELLULAR AND PERIPLASMIC ACCUMULATION OF METAL IN THE CELLS IN SPITE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE CZCA GENE, INDICATING THE PRESENCE OF MULTIPLE MECHANISMS OF METAL RESISTANCE IN STRAIN SB21. FURTHER, THE STRAINS WERE CHARACTERIZED FUNCTIONALLY FOR THEIR BIOREMEDIATION POTENTIAL IN CADMIUM CONTAMINATED SOIL UNDER ACIDIC AND ALKALINE CONDITIONS BY PERFORMING AN IN SITU GREENHOUSE EXPERIMENT USING MUNGBEAN PLANTS. A MARKED INCREASE IN AGRONOMICAL PARAMETERS WAS OBSERVED UNDER ACIDIC CONDITIONS IN THE PRESENCE OF STRAIN SB21. MOREOVER, THE CONCENTRATION OF METAL DECREASED IN BOTH PLANTS AND SOIL IN THE PRESENCE OF THESE BIOINOCULANTS; HOWEVER, STRAIN SB21 WAS FOUND TO BE A BETTER DECONTAMINATOR THAN SB20 AND THUS CAN FURTHER BE EMPLOYED IN BIOREMEDIATION APPLICATIONS.	***

PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE SHEAR IN CONCRETE IS RESISTED BY VARIOUS MECHANISMS AND THE RESISTANCE DEGRADES WITH THE INCREASE OF FLEXURAL DEFORMATION. THE PAPER INTRODUCES A NOVEL APPROACH IN UTILIZING THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SHEAR RESISTANCE DEGRADATION BY COUPLING THE SHEAR RESISTANCE WITH THE SHEAR DEMAND. BOTH THE SHEAR RESISTANCE AND SHEAR DEMAND ARE CORRELATED WITH FLEXURAL TENSILE STRAIN FROM COMPATIBILITY AND EQUILIBRIUM REQUIREMENTS. THE BASIC SHEAR STRENGTH, UNDER A GIVEN LOADING IS DETERMINED FROM THE INTERSECTION OF THE DEMAND AND RESISTANCE CURVES. THE PROCEDURE WAS VERIFIED AGAINST A DATABASE OF 232 BEAMS COLLECTED FROM 10 SOURCES WITH A BROAD RANGE OF PARAMETERS. IT SHOWED GOOD PREDICTION CAPABILITY AND CAN BE USEFUL TO DESIGN PRACTICE.	***

TO PREVENT A GENUINE USERS TEMPLATES FROM BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL THREATS, A NOVEL AND SIMPLE METHOD COMBINED OPTICAL ENCRYPTION WITH MULTIMODAL BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION TECHNIQUE IS PROPOSED. IN THIS METHOD, THE STANDARD BIOMETRIC TEMPLATES ARE GENERATED REAL TIMELY BY THE VERIFICATION KEYS OWNED BY LEGAL USER SO THAT THEY ARE UNNECESSARY TO BE STORED IN A DATABASE. COMPARED WITH THE TRADITIONAL RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS, STORAGE SPACE AND MATCHING TIME ARE GREATLY SAVED.

IN THE PRESENT STUDY, THE ORIGINS OF THE HERBAL MEDICINE SCHISANDRA CHINENSIS WERE DIFFERENTIATED USING TWO INSTRUMENTAL APPROACHES, GC/MS AND LC/MS. THE ACQUIRED DATA WERE PROCESSED USING VARIOUS PROGRAMS TO DETECT METABOLITES AND STATISTICALLY EXAMINED TO MEASURE THE SUITABILITY OF THE METHODS. THE (RX) X 2 VALUE OF THE PCA ANALYSIS WAS USED TO EXAMINE THE IDENTIFIED METABOLITES AS POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATIVE MARKERS. THE IDENTIFICATION OF MARKERS BY PRIMARY METABOLITES USING GC/MS ANALYSIS WAS ADVANTAGEOUS BECAUSE OF ITS REPRODUCIBILITY AND THE USE OF A CONSTRUCTED DATABASE. HOWEVER, LC/MS ANALYSIS USING SECONDARY METABOLITES PROVIDED A GREATER NUMBER OF DISTINGUISHABLE VARIABLES AND HIGHER QUALITATIVE (RX) X 2 VALUES FOR THE MARKERS, WHICH SUGGESTED THAT DETERMINATION OF THE ORIGINS OF THE PLANTS WAS MORE FAVOURABLE USING SECONDARY METABOLITES.

WE SEARCHED ELECTRONIC DATABASES FOR STUDIES PUBLISHED FROM JANUARY 2000 UP TO APRIL 2013. EIGHT ECOLOGICAL STUDIES, SIX CASE CONTROL STUDIES, FOUR COHORT STUDIES AND TWO META ANALYSES WERE IDENTIFIED. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE STUDIES WERE CARRIED OUT IN AREAS WITH HIGH ARSENIC CONCENTRATIONS IN DRINKING WATER SUCH AS SOUTHWESTERN AND NORTHEASTERN TAIWAN, PAKISTAN, BANGLADESH, ARGENTINA (CORDOBA PROVINCE), USA (SOUTHEASTERN MICHIGAN, FLORIDA, IDAHO) AND CHILE. MOST OF THE STUDIES REPORTED HIGHER RISKS OF BLADDER CANCER INCIDENCE OR MORTALITY IN AREAS WITH HIGH ARSENIC CONCENTRATIONS IN DRINKING WATER COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION OR A LOW ARSENIC EXPOSED CONTROL GROUP. THE QUALITY ASSESSMENT SHOWED THAT AMONG THE STUDIES IDENTIFIED, ARSENIC EXPOSURE WAS ASSESSED AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL ONLY IN HALF OF THEM AND ONLY THREE ASSESSED EXPOSURE USING A BIOMARKER. FURTHER, FIVE OUT OF EIGHT ECOLOGICAL STUDIES PRESENTED RESULTS WITH ADJUSTMENT FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS EXCEPT FOR AGE; ALL COHORT AND CASE CONTROL STUDIES PRESENTED RESULTS WITH ADJUSTMENT FOR CIGARETTE SMOKING STATUS IN THE ANALYSIS. THE MAJORITY OF THE STUDIES WITH VARYING STUDY DESIGNS CARRIED OUT IN DIFFERENT AREAS PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF STATISTICALLY SIGINIFICANT INCREASES IN BLADDER CANCER RISK AT HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF ARSENIC (>50G L 1).

THE LACK OF STANDARD TESTS LEADS TO HIGH VARIABILITY IN PUBLISHED RESULTS AND HINDERS THE DEVELOPMENT OF RELIABLE DESIGN MODELS. THE TESTING PROGRAMME PRESENTED HEREIN WAS PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL ROUND ROBIN TEST (IRRT) EXERCISE, AIMED AT ASSESSING THE SUITABILITY OF DOUBLE SHEAR TESTS TO CHARACTERISE THE BOND BEHAVIOUR OF FRP STRENGTHENING SYSTEMS. A TOTAL OF 20 TESTS WERE PERFORMED ON DIFFERENT FRP PLATES. RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO IMPROVE THE IRRT METHODOLOGY ARE GIVEN. BASED ON THE RESULTS, AN IMPROVED CAPACITY MODEL THAT ACCOUNTS FOR CONCRETE SURFACE PREPARATION IS PROPOSED AND VALIDATED AGAINST AN EXTENSIVE DATABASE OF PUBLISHED RESULTS. THE OUTCOME OF THE CURRENT RESEARCH IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE ENGINEERS WITH MORE CONFIDENCE IN DESIGNING SAFELY STRENGTHENING APPLICATIONS WHILST MAKING THE BEST USE OF THE FRP MATERIALS.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE TEST DATABASE CONSTRUCTED FROM THE RESULTS OF AXIAL COMPRESSION TESTS ON 832 CIRCULAR FRP CONFINED CONCRETE SPECIMENS PUBLISHED IN THE LITERATURE. THE DATABASE WAS ASSEMBLED THROUGH AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE THAT COVERED 3042 TEST RESULTS FROM 253 EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1991 AND THE MIDDLE OF 2013. THE SUITABILITY OF THE RESULTS FOR THE DATABASE WAS DETERMINED USING CAREFULLY CHOSEN SELECTION CRITERIA TO ENSURE A RELIABLE DATABASE. THIS DATABASE BRINGS RELIABLE TEST RESULTS OF FRP CONFINED CONCRETE TOGETHER TO FORM A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK FOR FUTURE REFERENCE. CLOSE EXAMINATION OF THE TEST RESULTS REPORTED IN THE DATABASE LED TO A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS ON THE INFLUENCE OF IMPORTANT PARAMETERS ON THE BEHAVIOR OF FRP CONFINED CONCRETE. A NEW DESIGN ORIENTED MODEL THAT WAS DEVELOPED TO QUANTIFY THESE OBSERVATIONS IS PRESENTED IN THE FINAL PART OF THE PAPER. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE PREDICTIONS OF THE PROPOSED MODEL ARE IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH THE TEST RESULTS AND THE MODEL PROVIDES IMPROVED PREDICTIONS OF THE ULTIMATE CONDITIONS OF FRP CONFINED CONCRETE COMPARED TO ANY OF THE EXISTING MODELS.

EVEN IF THEY PROVE THEIR EFFICIENCY IN CLASSICAL CONTEXTS, GMM/UBM SYSTEMS SHOW THEIR LIMITATIONS WHEN RESTRICTING THE QUANTITY OF SPEECH DATA. IN CONTRAST, THE PROPOSED GMM/UBM EXTENSION ADDRESSES SITUATIONS CHARACTERISED BY LIMITED ENROLMENT DATA AND ONLY THE COMPUTING POWER TYPICALLY FOUND ON MODERN MOBILE DEVICES. A KEY CONTRIBUTION COMES FROM THE HARNESSING OF THE TEMPORAL STRUCTURE OF SPEECH USING CLIENT CUSTOMISED PASS PHRASES AND NEW MARKOV MODEL STRUCTURES. ADDITIONAL TEMPORAL INFORMATION IS THEN USED TO ENHANCE DISCRIMINATION WITH VITERBI DECODING, INCREASING THE GAP BETWEEN CLIENT AND IMPOSTER SCORES. EXPERIMENTS ON THE MYIDEA DATABASE ARE PRESENTED WITH A STANDARD GMM/UBM CONFIGURATION ACTING AS A BENCHMARK. WHEN IMPOSTERS DO NOT KNOW THE CLIENT PASS PHRASE, A RELATIVE GAIN OF UP TO 65% IN TERMS OF EER IS ACHIEVED OVER THE GMM/UBM BASELINE CONFIGURATION. THE RESULTS CLEARLY HIGHLIGHT THE POTENTIAL OF THIS NEW APPROACH, WITH A GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN COMPLEXITY AND RECOGNITION ACCURACY. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED FEATURES IS VERIFIED WITH EVIDENCE FROM EXHAUSTIVE EXPERIMENTS ON A LARGE COMPOSITE IMAGE DATABASE. COMPARED WITH PRIOR ARTS, THE PROPOSED METHOD ACHIEVES SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT IN THE CASE OF LOW RESOLUTION AND STRONG JPEG POST COMPRESSION. IN ADDITION, IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT OUR METHOD IS MORE ROBUST AGAINST ADDITIVE NOISE THAN OTHER EXISTING MF DETECTORS.

THE WIDELY USED GABOR FILTERING BASED COMPETITIVE CODING SCHEME IS SENSITIVE TO SUCH VARIATIONS, RESULTING IN MANY FALSE REJECTIONS. WE PROPOSE TO ALLEVIATE THIS PROBLEM BY RECONSTRUCTING THE QUERY SAMPLE WITH A DICTIONARY LEARNED FROM THE TEMPLATE SAMPLES IN THE GALLERY SET. THE RECONSTRUCTED FKP IMAGE CAN REDUCE MUCH THE ENLARGED MATCHING DISTANCE CAUSED BY FINGER POSE VARIATIONS; HOWEVER, BOTH THE INTRA CLASS AND INTER CLASS DISTANCES WILL BE REDUCED.

LOCAL FEATURES HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE ROBUST TO IMAGE TRANSFORMATIONS, INCLUDING OCCLUSIONS AND CLUTTERS. HOWEVER, THE GEOMETRIC PROPERTY OF AN AERIAL IMAGE (I.E., THE TOPOLOGY AND RELATIVE DISPLACEMENT OF LOCAL FEATURES), WHICH IS KEY TO DISCRIMINATING AERIAL IMAGE CATEGORIES, CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY REPRESENTED BY STATE OF THE ART GENERIC VISUAL DESCRIPTORS. TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, WE PROPOSE A RECOGNITION MODEL THAT MINES GRAPHLETS FROM AERIAL IMAGES, WHERE GRAPHLETS ARE SMALL CONNECTED SUBGRAPHS REFLECTING BOTH THE GEOMETRIC PROPERTY AND COLOR/TEXTURE DISTRIBUTION OF AN AERIAL IMAGE. MORE SPECIFICALLY, EACH AERIAL IMAGE IS DECOMPOSED INTO A SET OF BASIC COMPONENTS (E. G., ROAD AND PLAYGROUND) AND A REGION ADJACENCY GRAPH (RAG) IS ACCORDINGLY CONSTRUCTED TO MODEL THEIR SPATIAL INTERACTIONS. AERIAL IMAGE CATEGORIES RECOGNITION CAN SUBSEQUENTLY BE CASTED AS RAG TO RAG MATCHING. BASED ON GRAPH THEORY, RAG TO RAG MATCHING IS CONDUCTED BY COMPARING ALL THEIR RESPECTIVE GRAPHLETS. BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF GRAPHLETS IS HUGE, WE DERIVE A MANIFOLD EMBEDDING ALGORITHM TO MEASURE DIFFERENT SIZED GRAPHLETS, AFTER WHICH WE SELECT GRAPHLETS THAT HAVE HIGHLY DISCRIMINATIVE AND LOW REDUNDANCY TOPOLOGIES. THROUGH QUANTIZING THE SELECTED GRAPHLETS FROM EACH AERIAL IMAGE INTO A FEATURE VECTOR, WE USE SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE TO DISCRIMINATE AERIAL IMAGE CATEGORIES. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS INDICATE THAT OUR METHOD OUTPERFORMS SEVERAL STATE OF THE ART OBJECT/SCENE RECOGNITION MODELS, AND THE VISUALIZED GRAPHLETS INDICATE THAT THE DISCRIMINATIVE PATTERNS ARE DISCOVERED BY OUR PROPOSED APPROACH.	***

PARTICIPANTS (N 40) MADE PAIR WISE COMPARISONS OF HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO CLIPS ENHANCED AT FOUR DIFFERENT LEVELS USING A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE ENHANCEMENT DEVICE. PERCEPTUAL SCALES WERE COMPUTED WITH BINARY LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO ESTIMATE PREFERENCES FOR EACH LEVEL AND TO PROVIDE STATISTICAL INFERENCE OF THE DIFFERENCES AMONG LEVELS AND THE IMPACT OF OTHER VARIABLES. WHILE MODERATE PREFERENCE FOR ENHANCED VIDEOS WAS FOUND, TWO UNEXPECTED EFFECTS WERE ALSO UNCOVERED: 1) PARTICIPANTS COULD BE BROADLY CLASSIFIED INTO TWO GROUPS: A) THOSE WHO PREFERRED ENHANCEMENT (SHARP) AND B) THOSE WHO DISLIKED ENHANCEMENT (SMOOTH) AND 2) ENHANCEMENT PREFERENCES DEPENDED ON VIDEO CONTENT, PARTICULARLY FOR HUMAN FACES TO BE ENHANCED LESS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ALGORITHMS TO EVALUATE IMAGE QUALITY (AT LEAST FOR ENHANCEMENT) MAY NEED TO BE ADJUSTED OR APPLIED DIFFERENTIALLY BASED ON VIDEO CONTENT AND VIEWER PREFERENCES.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE SEASONAL VARIATION OF VEGETATION GREENNESS BASED ON THE NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX (NDVI) IN MAJOR LAND COVER TYPES IN THE REGION. AN ASSESSMENT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CLIMATE PATTERNS AND VEGETATION CONDITIONS OBSERVED FROM NDVI WAS MADE. NDVI DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM YEAR 2001 TO 2009 USING MULTI TEMPORAL TERRA MODIS VEGETATION INDICES PRODUCT (MOD13Q1). NDVI PROFILES WERE DEVELOPED TO MEASURE VEGETATION DYNAMICS AND VARIATION ACCORDING TO LAND COVER TYPES. METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION, I.E. RAINFALL AND TEMPERATURE, FOR A 30 YEAR TIME SPAN FROM 1980 TO 2009 WAS ANALYZED FOR THEIR PATTERNS. FURTHERMORE, THE DATA TAKEN FROM THE PERIOD OF 2001 2009, WERE DIGITALLY ENCODED INTO GIS DATABASE AND THE SPATIAL PATTERNS OF MONTHLY RAINFALL AND TEMPERATURE MAPS WERE GENERATED BASED ON KRIGING TECHNIQUE. THE RESULTS SHOWED A DECREASING TREND IN NDVI VALUES FOR BOTH DECIDUOUS AND EVERGREEN FORESTS. THE HIGHEST PRODUCTIVITY AND BIOMASS WERE OBSERVED IN DRY EVERGREEN FORESTS AND THE LOWEST IN PADDY FIELDS. TEMPERATURE WAS FOUND TO BE INCREASING SLIGHTLY FROM 1980 TO 2009 WHILE NO SIGNIFICANT TRENDS IN RAINFALL AMOUNTS WERE OBSERVED. IN DRY EVERGREEN FOREST, NDVI WAS NOT CORRELATED WITH RAINFALL BUT WAS SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH TEMPERATURE. THESE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE OVERALL PRODUCTIVITY IN DRY EVERGREEN FOREST WAS AFFECTED BY INCREASING TEMPERATURES. A VEGETATION GREENNESS MODEL WAS DEVELOPED FROM CORRELATIONS BETWEEN NDVI AND METEOROLOGICAL DATA USING LINEAR REGRESSION. THE MODEL COULD BE USED TO OBSERVE THE CHANGE IN VEGETATION GREENNESS AND DYNAMICS AFFECTED BY TEMPERATURE AND RAINFALL.	***

INCORPORATING THESE COMPONENTS AT THE CONCEPTUAL STAGE IS ACHIEVED BY USING SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, THROUGH WHICH DESIGNERS MUST IDENTIFY ASSOCIATED MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS BASED ON ANY SELECTED CERTIFICATION (RATING) SYSTEM. THE USE OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) CONCEPTS HELPS ENGINEERS DESIGN DIGITAL MODELS THAT ALLOW OWNERS TO VISUALIZE THE BUILDING BEFORE THE PHYSICAL IMPLEMENTATION TAKES PLACE.

DESIGNERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO QUANTIFY THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THESE MATERIALS TO SUPPORT THE DECISIONS NEEDED TO DESIGN SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS DUE TO THE FOLLOWING REASONS: (1) A LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS THAT ARE STORED IN THE DATABASE, (2) A LACK OF INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN THE DESIGN AND ANALYSIS TOOLS THAT ENABLE FULL LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENTS (LCAS) OF BUILDINGS.

LDA IS USED FOR CONCEPT AND TOPIC ANALYSIS TO SUGGEST CANDIDATE WORD LISTS OR TOPICS THAT DESCRIBE AND RELATE SOFTWARE ARTIFACTS. HOWEVER, THESE WORD LISTS AND TOPICS ARE DIFFICULT TO INTERPRET IN THE ABSENCE OF MEANINGFUL SUMMARY LABELS. CURRENT ATTEMPTS TO INTERPRET TOPICS ASSUME MANUAL LABELLING AND DO NOT USE DOMAIN SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE TO IMPROVE, CONTEXTUALIZE, OR DESCRIBE RESULTS FOR THE DEVELOPERS. WE PROPOSE A SOLUTION: AUTOMATED LABELLED TOPIC EXTRACTION. TOPICS ARE EXTRACTED USING LDA FROM COMMIT LOG COMMENTS RECOVERED FROM SOURCE CONTROL SYSTEMS. THESE TOPICS ARE GIVEN LABELS FROM A GENERALIZABLE CROSS PROJECT TAXONOMY, CONSISTING OF NON FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS. OUR APPROACH WAS EVALUATED WITH EXPERIMENTS AND CASE STUDIES ON THREE LARGE SCALE RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS) PROJECTS: MYSQL, POSTGRESQL AND MAXDB.

IN THIS WORK, WE MOTIVATE THE NEED FOR THE RECOVERY OF THE PROVENANCE OF SOFTWARE ENTITIES BY A BROAD SET OF TECHNIQUES THAT COULD INCLUDE SIGNATURE MATCHING, SOURCE CODE FACT EXTRACTION, SOFTWARE CLONE DETECTION, CALL FLOW GRAPH MATCHING, STRING MATCHING, HISTORICAL ANALYSES, AND OTHER TECHNIQUES. WE LIKEN OUR PROVENANCE GOALS TO THAT OF BERTILLONAGE, A SIMPLE AND APPROXIMATE FORENSIC ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE BASED ON BIO METRICS THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN 19TH CENTURY FRANCE BEFORE THE ADVENT OF FINGERPRINTS. AS AN EXAMPLE, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A FAST, SIMPLE, AND APPROXIMATE TECHNIQUE CALLED ANCHORED SIGNATURE MATCHING FOR IDENTIFYING THE SOURCE ORIGIN OF BINARY LIBRARIES WITHIN A GIVEN JAVA APPLICATION. THIS TECHNIQUE INVOLVES A TYPE OF STRUCTURED SIGNATURE MATCHING PERFORMED AGAINST A DATABASE OF CANDIDATES DRAWN FROM THE MAVEN2 REPOSITORY, A 275 GB COLLECTION OF OPEN SOURCE JAVA LIBRARIES. TO SHOW THE APPROACH IS BOTH VALID AND EFFECTIVE, WE CONDUCTED AN EMPIRICAL STUDY ON 945 JARS FROM THE DEBIAN GNU/LINUX DISTRIBUTION, AS WELL AS AN INDUSTRIAL CASE STUDY ON 81 JARS FROM AN E COMMERCE APPLICATION.	***

ONE OF THE CRUCIAL STEPS IN THE IRIS RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS THE IRIS SEGMENTATION BECAUSE IT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS THE ACCURACY OF THE FEATURE EXTRACTION AND IRIS MATCHING STEPS. TRADITIONAL IRIS SEGMENTATION METHODS PROVIDE EXCELLENT RESULTS WHEN IRIS IMAGES ARE CAPTURED USING NEAR INFRARED CAMERAS UNDER IDEAL IMAGING CONDITIONS, BUT THE ACCURACY OF THESE ALGORITHMS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASES WHEN THE IRIS IMAGES ARE TAKEN IN VISIBLE WAVELENGTH UNDER NON IDEAL IMAGING CONDITIONS. IN THIS PAPER, A NEW ALGORITHM IS PROPOSED TO SEGMENTS IRIS IMAGES CAPTURED IN VISIBLE WAVELENGTH UNDER UNCONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENTS. THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM REDUCES THE ERROR PERCENTAGE EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF TYPES OF NOISE INCLUDE IRIS OBSTRUCTIONS AND SPECULAR REFLECTION. THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM STARTS WITH DETERMINING THE EXPECTED REGION OF THE IRIS USING THE K MEANS CLUSTERING ALGORITHM. THE CIRCULAR HOUGH TRANSFORM (CHT) IS THEN EMPLOYED IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE IRIS RADIUS AND CENTER. A NEW EFFICIENT ALGORITHM IS DEVELOPED TO DETECT AND ISOLATE THE UPPER EYELIDS. FINALLY, THE NON IRIS REGIONS ARE REMOVED. RESULTS OF APPLYING THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM ON UBIRIS IRIS IMAGE DATABASES DEMONSTRATE THAT IT IMPROVES THE SEGMENTATION ACCURACY AND TIME.

AS A RESULT, THERE IS A NEED TO TAILOR THE SYSTEM TO EACH USER. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES A RELATIVELY NEW FUSION STRATEGY THAT IS BOTH USER SPECIFIC AND SELECTIVE. BY USER SPECIFIC, WE UNDERSTAND THAT EACH USER IN A BIOMETRIC SYSTEM HAS A DIFFERENT SET OF FUSION PARAMETERS THAT HAVE BEEN TUNED SPECIFICALLY TO A GIVEN ENROLLED USER. BY SELECTIVE, WE MEAN THAT ONLY A SUBSET OF MODALITIES MAY BE CHOSEN FOR FUSION. THE RATIONALE FOR THIS IS THAT IF ONE BIOMETRIC MODALITY IS SUFFICIENTLY GOOD TO RECOGNIZE A USER, FUSION BY MULTIMODAL BIOMETRICS WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY, WE ADVANCE THE STATE OF THE ART IN USER SPECIFIC AND SELECTIVE FUSION IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS: (1) PROVIDE THOROUGH ANALYSES OF (A) THE EFFECT OF PRE PROCESSING THE BIOMETRIC OUTPUT (PRIOR TO APPLYING A USER SPECIFIC SCORE NORMALIZATION PROCEDURE) IN ORDER TO IMPROVE ITS CENTRAL TENDENCY AND (B) THE GENERALISATION ABILITY OF USER SPECIFIC PARAMETERS; (2) PROPOSE A CRITERION TO RANK THE USERS BASED SOLELY ON A TRAINING SCORE DATASET IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE OBTAINED RANK ORDER WILL MAXIMALLY CORRELATE WITH THE RANK ORDER THAT IS OBTAINED IF IT WERE TO BE COMPUTED ON THE TEST SET; AND, (3) EXPERIMENTALLY DEMONSTRATE THE PERFORMANCE GAIN OF A USER SPECIFIC AND SELECTIVE FUSION STRATEGY ACROSS FUSION DATA SETS AT DIFFERENT VALUES OF PRUNING RATE THAT CONTROL THE PERCENTAGE OF SUBJECTS FOR WHOM FUSION IS NOT REQUIRED. FIFTEEN SETS OF MULTIMODAL FUSION EXPERIMENTS CARRIED OUT ON THE XM2VTS SCORE LEVEL BENCHMARK DATABASE SHOW THAT EVEN THOUGH OUR PROPOSED USER SPECIFIC AND SELECTIVE FUSION STRATEGY, ITS PERFORMANCE COMPARES FAVORABLY WITH THE CONVENTIONAL FUSION SYSTEM THAT CONSIDERS ALL INFORMATION.

MOST OF THESE STUDIES ARE WRITTEN BY PEOPLE WITH VARIOUS PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUNDS SUCH AS JOURNALISM, TEACHING, ANNOUNCING, ETC. AND DUE TO THE LACK OF A LINGUISTIC PERSPECTIVE AND METHODOLOGICAL AND THEORETICAL BASIS, THEY MAY INCLUDE SOME MISCONCEPTIONS. THESE PUBLICATIONS, ALSO BEING RECOMMENDED FOR ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, INCLUDE HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND DISPUTABLE JUDGEMENTS, AND SOMETIMES THEY MAY LEAD THE WAY FOR OTHER UNFRUITFUL DISPUTES WHICH EVENTUALLY END UP IN A VICIOUS CYCLE. IN THIS STUDY, A DATABASE COMPOSED OF TWELVE BOOKS ABOUT THE IMPROPER USE OF TURKISH PUBLISHED WITHIN THE LAST DECADE IS STUDIED IN AN ATTEMPT TO REVEAL METHODOLOGICAL AND THEORETICAL MISCONCEPTIONS. MY AIM IS TO APPROACH THIS TYPE OF LITERATURE CRITICALLY, WHICH MAY EVENTUALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE LINGUISTIC CONSCIOUSNESS AND LANGUAGE PLANNING PROCESSES AND ALSO SUGGEST NEW FIELDS OF INQUIRY FOR THE SOCIOLINGUISTS.	***

MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE IDENTIFIED STUDIES PUBLISHED FROM 1990 ONWARDS BY SEARCHING THE MEDLINE DATABASE OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE. INITIAL SEARCH TERMS WERE ANDROGEN RECEPTORS, CYTOPLASMIC ANDROGEN RECEPTOR, AND MEMBRANE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR COMBINED WITH TESTOSTERONE, TESTOSTERONE ALBUMIN CONJUGATE, AND PROSTATE CANCER TREATMENT. RESULTS: THE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN BOTH DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESSION OF PCA. THE LATTER IS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN THE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR AXIS AND MORE PRECISELY, WITH ITS CONVERSION FROM A PARACRINE DEPENDENT SIGNALING PATHWAY FOR PROLIFERATION AND SURVIVAL OF PROSTATIC CELLS TO AN INDEPENDENT AUTOCRINE PROCESS. THIS MALIGNANT CONVERSION IS DUE TO FUNCTIONAL CHANGES IN WHICH THE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR ACTIVATES NOT ONLY NORMAL GENOMIC, BUT ALSO NOVEL NON GENOMIC SIGNALING PATHWAYS, WHICH ARE NOT PRESENT IN NORMAL PROSTATIC EPITHELIAL CELLS. THUS, TREATMENTS FOR NEOADJUVANT, ADJUVANT, AND RECURRENT DISEASE, ALL CENTER ON THE REGULATION AND MANIPULATION OF THE ANDROGEN PATHWAY. RECENT DISCOVERIES HOWEVER OFFER STRONG EVIDENCE OF A DIRECT APOPTOTIC ACTION INDUCED BY ACTIVATION OF THE MEMBRANE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR BY TESTOSTERONE ALBUMIN CONJUGATES. CONCLUSION: INVESTIGATION OF THE MOLECULAR PATHWAYS OF APOPTOSIS THROUGH ACTIVATION OF THE MEMBRANE ANDROGEN RECEPTORS IN THE ANDROGEN INDEPENDENT PCA CELL IS IMPORTANT ON THE ONE HAND BECAUSE FUTURE MANIPULATION OF THIS MECHANISM CAN HELP WITH UNDERSTANDING AND INTERPRETING UNKNOWN TO DATE CHARACTERISTICS OF PCA AND ON THE OTHER HAND, CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ACTIVATORS OF MEMBRANE ANDROGEN RECEPTORS. IN ADDITION, STUDY OF THE TESTOSTERONE ALBUMIN COMPLEX CAN CONSTITUTE THE BASIS FOR FUTURE TREATMENTS FOR PCA.	***

THIS CROSS SECTIONAL STUDY EVALUATED THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN SFM SCORE AND HISTORY OF VERTEBRAL COMPRESSION FRACTURE (VCF), HIP FRACTURE, AND INJURIOUS FALLS, ALL ESTABLISHED PREDICTORS OF FUTURE RISK. METHOD: AN OSTEOPOROSIS CLINIC DATABASE WAS QUERIED FOR ADULTS WITH AN INITIAL SFM SCORE AND CORRESPONDING DATA FOR PREVALENT VCF AND/OR HIP FRACTURE, FEMORAL NECK BONE MINERAL DENSITY (FNBMD), AND HISTORY OF INJURIOUS FALL (N 847). MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS, ADJUSTED FOR AGE, GENDER, AND FNBMD (AND INJURIOUS FALLS IN THE PREVALENT FRACTURE ANALYSES), WERE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER ASSOCIATIONS EXIST BETWEEN SFM SCORE AND PREVALENT VCF, PREVALENT HIP FRACTURE, AND HISTORY OF INJURIOUS FALL. RESULTS: SFM SCORE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PREVALENT VCF (ODDS RATIO [OR] 0.89; 95% CL, 0.79 0.99; P 0.036), PREVALENT HIP FRACTURE (OR 0.77; 95% CL, 0.65 0.92; P 0.004), AND HISTORY OF INJURIOUS FALL (OR 0.80; 95% CL, 0.70 0.93; P 0.003) AFTER ADJUSTING FOR OTHER IMPORTANT COVARIATES. CONCLUSIONS: ADULTS WITH HIGHER SFM SCORES (SAFER MOTION DURING PERFORMANCE OF EVERYDAY TASKS) WERE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A HISTORY OF FRACTURE OR INJURIOUS FALL. FURTHER STUDY IS WARRANTED TO EVALUATE THE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF THIS TOOL.	***

OUR STUDY AIMED TO PRODUCE RELIABLE ESTIMATES OF HEALTH CARE QUALITY AMONG NATIVE HAWAIIAN (NH), OTHER PACIFIC ISLANDER (PI), AND ASIAN AMERICAN (M) SUBGROUPS. DESIGN: PREVENTION QUALITY INDICATORS (PQIS) FROM THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY WERE USED TO CALCULATE 3 POI COMPOSITES AND 8 INDIVIDUAL CHRONIC CONDITION INDICATORS. DATA SOURCES WERE THE HEALTHCARE COST AND UTILIZATION PROJECT STATE INPATIENT DATABASES AND THE HAWAII HEALTH SURVEY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: RISK ADJUSTED PQI RATES FOR ADULTS WERE COMPUTED FOR 2005 THROUGH 2007. RELATIVE RATES FOR 2007 WERE CALCULATED FOR EACH RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUP AND COMPARED TO WHITES. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE WAS BASED ON P<.05 FROM A TWO SIDED T TEST. RESULTS: THE COMBINED AANHPI GROUP HAD HIGHER OVERALL AND CHRONIC POI COMPOSITE RATES THAN WHITES IN 2007. WHEN DISAGGREGATED INTO DISCRETE RACIAL/ETHNIC SUBGROUPS, CHINESE AND JAPANESE HAD LOWER RATES THAN WHITES FOR ALL 3 COMPOSITES, WHEREAS NH AND OTHER PI SUBGROUPS TYPICALLY HAD THE WORST HEALTH OUTCOMES. TRENDS IN PQI RATES FROM 2005 THROUGH 2007 SHOWED PERSISTENT GAPS BETWEEN GROUPS, ESPECIALLY ACROSS CHRONIC PQIS. CONCLUSIONS: DESPITE RECENT EFFORTS TO REDUCE RACIAL/ETHNIC HEALTH CARE DISPARITIES, SIGNIFICANT GAPS REMAIN IN POTENTIALLY PREVENTABLE HOSPITALIZATION RATES. PRACTICAL TOOLS THAT MEASURE INEQUITIES ACROSS DIVERSE, NUMERICALLY SMALL POPULATIONS MAY SUGGEST WAYS TO OPTIMALLY FUNNEL LIMITED RESOURCES TOWARD IMPROVING RACIAL/ETHNIC DIFFERENCES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES.

STUDIES OF TEMPORAL CHANGES IN DIVERSITY AND GLOBAL BIOGEOGRAPHIC PATTERNS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO OVERCOME FOSSIL SAMPLING BIASES THROUGH SAMPLING STANDARDIZATION PROTOCOLS, BUT SUCH APPROACHES MUST ULTIMATELY BE LIMITED BY AVAILABLE LITERATURE AND MUSEUM COLLECTIONS. ONE APPROACH TO EVALUATING SUCH LIMITS IS TO COMPARE RESULTS FROM THE FOSSIL RECORD WITH MODELS OF PAST DIVERSITY PATTERNS INFORMED BY MODERN RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DIVERSITY AND CLIMATIC FACTORS. HERE WE USE PRESENT DAY PATTERNS FOR MARINE BIVALVES, COMBINED WITH DATA ON THE GEOLOGIC AGES AND DISTRIBUTIONS OF EXTANT TAXA, TO DEVELOP A MODEL FOR PLIOCENE DIVERSITY PATTERNS, WHICH IS THEN COMPARED WITH DIVERSITY PATTERNS RETRIEVED FROM THE LITERATURE AS COMPILED BY THE PALEOBIOLOGY DATABASE (PALEODB).

THE APPROACH TREATS THE PROBLEM OF AGE ESTIMATION AS A COMBINATION OF CLASSIFICATION AND REGRESSION PROBLEMS. IN THIS APPROACH, FACE IMAGE IS ENCODED USING THE STATISTICALLY DRIVEN AAMS WHICH USES BOTH SHAPE AND APPEARANCE MODELS TO FORM A COMBINED MODEL TO REPRESENT THE FACE IMAGE AS A FEATURE VECTOR. A GLOBAL CLASSIFIER IS THEN USED TO OBTAIN A ROUGH IDEA ABOUT THE AGE BY DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN CHILD/TEEN HOOD AND ADULTHOOD, WHILE FINAL AGE ESTIMATION IS MADE USING REGRESSION FUNCTIONS.

A FURTHER AIM WAS TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE CRITICALITIES OF THIS SAFETY SYSTEM IN THE FIELD OF POWERED 2 WHEELERS (PTWS; E.G., ANY ADDITIONAL RISK INTRODUCED BY THE SYSTEM ITSELF). METHODS: SEVEN RELEVANT CASES FROM THE SWEDISH NATIONAL IN DEPTH FATAL CRASH DATABASE WERE SELECTED. ALL CRASHES INVOLVED CAR FOLLOWING IN WHICH A NON ANTI LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM (ABS) EQUIPPED MOTORCYCLE WAS THE BULLET VEHICLE. THOSE CRASHES WERE RECONSTRUCTED IN A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT WITH PRESCAN, SIMULATING THE ROAD SCENARIO, THE VEHICLES INVOLVED, THEIR PRECRASH TRAJECTORIES, ABS, AND, ALTERNATIVELY, MAEB. THE MAEB CHOSEN AS REFERENCE FOR THE INVESTIGATION WAS DEVELOPED WITHIN THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FUNDED POWERED TWO WHEELER INTEGRATED SAFETY (PISA) PROJECT AND FURTHER DETAILED IN LATER STUDIES, WITH THE ADDITION OF THE ABS FUNCTIONALITY. THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS OF EACH SIMULATION VARIED WITHIN A RANGE COMPATIBLE WITH THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE IN DEPTH DATA AND ALSO INCLUDED A RANGE OF POSSIBLE RIDER BEHAVIORS INCLUDING THE ACTUAL ONE. THE BENEFITS OF THE MAEB WERE EVALUATED BY COMPARING THE SIMULATED IMPACT SPEED IN EACH CONFIGURATION (NO ABS/MAEB, ABS ONLY, MAEB). RESULTS: THE MAEB PROVED TO BE BENEFICIAL IN A LARGE NUMBER OF CASES. WHEN APPLICABLE, THE BENEFITS OF THE SYSTEM WERE IN LINE WITH THE EXPECTED VALUES. WHEN NOT APPLICABLE, THERE WAS NO CLEAR EVIDENCE OF AN INCREASED RISK FOR THE RIDER DUE TO THE SYSTEM. DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS: MAEB REPRESENTS AN INNOVATIVE SAFETY DEVICE IN THE FIELD OF PTWS, AND THE FEASIBILITY OF SUCH A SYSTEM WAS INVESTIGATED WITH PROMISING RESULTS. NEVERTHELESS, THIS TECHNOLOGY IS NOT MATURE YET FOR PTW APPLICATION. RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF PASSENGER CARS DOES NOT DIRECTLY APPLY TO PTWS BECAUSE THE ACTIVATION LOGIC OF A BRAKING SYSTEM IS MORE CHALLENGING ON PTWS. THE DEPLOYMENT OF AN AUTONOMOUS DECELERATION WOULD AFFECT THE VEHICLE DYNAMICS, THUS REQUESTING AN ADDITIONAL CONTROL ACTION OF THE RIDER TO KEEP THE VEHICLE STABLE. IN ADDITION, THE POTENTIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MAEB SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED ON A WIDER SET OF CRASH SCENARIOS IN ORDER ALSO TO AVOID FALSE TRIGGERING OF THE AUTONOMOUS BRAKING.

THE ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR (RMSE) WAS 1.8 MJ M( 2) (9%) FOR HC3V3, WHICH IS LOWER THAN FOR MOST EMS. COEFFICIENTS OF DETERMINATION (R 2) WERE GREATER THAN 0.9 FOR MOST MODELS. THE REGRESSION LINE BETWEEN ESTIMATES AND OBSERVATIONS EXHIBITS A SLOPE OF 1.01 AND AN INTERCEPT OF 0.09 MJ M( 2) FOR HC3V3, REFLECTING A BETTER PERFORMANCE THAN OTHER MODELS.

BRAIN ARTERIAL VASCULATURE CAN BE VISUALIZED BY MAGNETIC RESONANCE ANGIOGRAPHY (MRA). HOWEVER, MOST MRA STUDIES ARE LIMITED TO QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENTS, PARTIAL MORPHOMETRIC ANALYSES, INDIVIDUAL (OR SMALL NUMBERS OF) SUBJECTS, PROPRIETARY DATASETS, OR COMBINATIONS OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS. NEUROINFORMATICS TOOLS, DEVELOPED FOR NEURONAL ARBOR ANALYSIS, WERE USED TO QUANTIFY VASCULAR MORPHOLOGY FROM 3 T TIME OF FLIGHT MRA HIGH RESOLUTION (620 PM ISOTROPIC) IMAGES COLLECTED IN 61 HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (36/25 F/M, AVERAGE AGE 31.2 +/ 10.7, RANGE 19 64 YEARS). WE PRESENT IN DEPTH MORPHOMETRIC ANALYSES OF THE GLOBAL AND LOCAL ANATOMICAL FEATURES OF THESE ARBORS. THE OVERALL STRUCTURE AND SIZE OF THE VASCULATURE DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER ACROSS GENDERS, AGES, OR HEMISPHERES. THE TOTAL LENGTH OF THE THREE MAJOR ARTERIAL TREES STEMMING FROM THE CIRCLE OF WILLIS (FROM SMALLEST TO LARGEST: THE POSTERIOR, ANTERIOR, AND MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERIES; OR PCAS, ACAS, AND MCAS, RESPECTIVELY) FOLLOWED AN APPROXIMATE 1:2:4 PROPORTION. ARTERIAL SIZE CO VARIED ACROSS INDIVIDUALS: SUBJECTS WITH ONE ARTERY LONGER THAN AVERAGE TENDED TO HAVE ALL OTHER ARTERIES ALSO LONGER THAN AVERAGE. THERE WAS NO NET RIGHT LEFT DIFFERENCE ACROSS THE POPULATION IN ANY OF THE INDIVIDUAL ARTERIES, BUT ACAS WERE MORE LATERALIZED THAN MCAS. MCAS, ACA.S, AND PCAS HAD SIMILAR BRANCH LEVEL PROPERTIES SUCH AS BIFURCATION ANGLES. THROUGHOUT THE ARTERIAL VASCULATURE, THERE WERE CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BRANCH TYPES: BIFURCATING BRANCHES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER AND STRAIGHTER THAN TERMINATING BRANCHES. FURTHERMORE, THE LENGTH AND MEANDERING OF BIFURCATING BRANCHES INCREASED WITH AGE AND WITH PATH DISTANCE FROM THE CIRCLE OF WILLIS. ALL RECONSTRUCTIONS ARE FREELY DISTRIBUTED THROUGH A PUBLIC DATABASE TO ENABLE ADDITIONAL ANALYSES AND MODELING (CNG.GMU.EDU/BRAVA). (C) 2013 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

TO DATE, THE GRADIENTS OF DOPAMINE D 2/3 RECEPTOR BINDING IN THE HUMAN STRIATUM HAVE NOT BEEN MEASURED WITH POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET). SEVEN HEALTHY MALE SUBJECTS AGED 24.5 +/ 3.5 YEARS WERE SCANNED WITH BRAIN DEDICATED HIGH RESOLUTION RESEARCH TOMOGRAPHY (HRRT, SIEMENS MEDICAL SOLUTIONS, KNOXVILLE, TN, USA) AND [C 11]RACLOPRIDE. CORONALLY DEFINED REGIONS OF INTEREST (ROIS) OF THE CAUDATE NUCLEUS, PUTAMEN AND VENTRAL STRIATUM (VST) WERE SAMPLED PLANE BY PLANE, 1.5 MM APART, ON SPATIALLY NORMALIZED BINDING POTENTIAL (BPND) IMAGES. REGIONAL [C 11]RACLOPRIDE BPND VALUES WERE CALCULATED USING THE SIMPLIFIED REFERENCE TISSUE MODEL (SRTM) FROM A TOTAL OF 25 CORONAL PLANES. AN INCREASING ROSTROCAUDAL GRADIENT OF THE D 2/3 RECEPTOR BINDING WAS DETECTED IN THE PUTAMEN, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE KNOWN DISTRIBUTION OF D 2/3 DOPAMINE RECEPTORS. IN THE CAUDATE NUCLEUS, THERE WAS AN INITIAL INCREASE IN THE BPND VALUES IN THE MOST ANTERIOR PLANES, SUGGESTING THAT THE HIGHEST D 2/3 RECEPTOR BINDING OCCURRED IN THE HEAD; HOWEVER, THERE WAS AN OVERALL DESCENDING GRADIENT. A DECLINING TREND WAS ALSO OBSERVED IN THE VST. THE NOVELTY OF THIS STUDY LIES IN THE PRESENTATION, FOR THE FIRST TIME, OF THE D 2/3 RECEPTOR BINDING GRADIENTS IN EACH STRIATAL SUBREGION IN THE BRAINS OF LIVING HEALTHY HUMANS. THE HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION PROVIDED BY HRRT ENABLES FREQUENT SAMPLING OF BPND ALONG THE LONGITUDINAL EXTENT OF STRIATUM; THIS METHOD IS SUPERIOR TO THE SECTIONING USED IN PREVIOUS POST MORTEM STUDIES. REGARDING THE FUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATION OF THE STRIATUM, OUR FINDINGS CAN INFORM FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS OF NORMAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY AS WELL AS EFFORTS TO DIFFERENTIATE NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS AFFECTING THE BRAIN DOPAMINE (DA) SYSTEM. FURTHERMORE, THE AVERAGE DISTRIBUTION OF D 2/3 RECEPTOR BINDING REVEALED IN THIS STUDY COULD SERVE AS A BASIS FOR A DATABASE THAT INCLUDES DISTRIBUTIONS OF VARIOUS DA MARKERS AS A FUNCTION OF HEALTHY AGING.

IN THIS STUDY, WE EVALUATE HOW MUCH VARIABILITY CAN BE REDUCED BY ANALYZING STRUCTURAL VOLUME CHANGES IN LONGITUDINAL DATA USING LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS. WE PROPOSE A TWO PART PIPELINE THAT CONSISTS OF LONGITUDINAL REGISTRATION AND LONGITUDINAL CLASSIFICATION. THE LONGITUDINAL REGISTRATION STEP INCLUDES THE CREATION OF SUBJECT SPECIFIC LINEAR AND NONLINEAR TEMPLATES THAT ARE THEN REGISTERED TO A POPULATION TEMPLATE. THE LONGITUDINAL CLASSIFICATION STEP COMPRISES A FOUR DIMENSIONAL EXPECTATION MAXIMIZATION ALGORITHM, USING A PRIORI CLASSES COMPUTED BY AVERAGING THE TISSUE CLASSES OF ALL TIME POINTS OBTAINED CROSS SECTIONALLY. TO STUDY THE IMPACT OF THESE TWO STEPS, WE APPLY THE FRAMEWORK COMPLETELY (LL METHOD: LONGITUDINAL REGISTRATION AND LONGITUDINAL CLASSIFICATION) AND PARTIALLY (LC METHOD: LONGITUDINAL REGISTRATION AND CROSS SECTIONAL CLASSIFICATION) AND COMPARE THESE WITH A STANDARD CROSS SECTIONAL FRAMEWORK (CC METHOD: CROSS SECTIONAL REGISTRATION AND CROSS SECTIONAL CLASSIFICATION). THE THREE METHODS ARE APPLIED TO (1) A SCAN RESCAN DATABASE TO ANALYZE RELIABILITY AND (2) THE NIH PEDIATRIC POPULATION TO COMPARE GRAY MATTER GROWTH TRAJECTORIES EVALUATED WITH A LINEAR MIXED MODEL. THE LL METHOD, AND THE LC METHOD TO A LESSER EXTENT, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE VARIABILITY IN THE MEASUREMENTS IN THE SCAN RESCAN STUDY AND GAVE THE BEST FITTED GRAY MATTER GROWTH MODEL WITH THE NIH PEDIATRIC MRI DATABASE. THE RESULTS CONFIRM THAT BOTH STEPS OF THE LONGITUDINAL FRAMEWORK REDUCE VARIABILITY AND IMPROVE ACCURACY IN COMPARISON WITH THE CROSS SECTIONAL FRAMEWORK, WITH LONGITUDINAL CLASSIFICATION YIELDING THE GREATEST IMPACT. USING THE IMPROVED METHOD TO ANALYZE LONGITUDINAL DATA, WE STUDY THE GROWTH TRAJECTORIES OF ANATOMICAL BRAIN STRUCTURES IN CHILDHOOD USING THE NIH PEDIATRIC MRI DATABASE. WE REPORT AGE AND GENDER RELATED GROWTH TRAJECTORIES OF SPECIFIC REGIONS OF THE BRAIN DURING CHILDHOOD THAT COULD BE USED AS A REFERENCE IN STUDYING THE IMPACT OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS ON BRAIN DEVELOPMENT.

NEUROIMAGING DATA IS ACCUMULATING IN DISTRIBUTED DOMAIN SPECIFIC DATABASES AND THERE IS CURRENTLY NO INTEGRATED ACCESS MECHANISM NOR AN ACCEPTED FORMAT FOR THE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT META DATA THAT IS NECESSARY FOR MAKING USE OF THE COMBINED, AVAILABLE NEUROIMAGING DATA. IN THIS MANUSCRIPT, WE PRESENT WORK FROM THE DERIVED DATA WORKING GROUP, AN OPEN ACCESS GROUP SPONSORED BY THE BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS RESEARCH NETWORK (BIRN) AND THE INTERNATIONAL NEUROIMAGING COORDINATING FACILITY (INCF) FOCUSED ON PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR DISTRIBUTED ACCESS TO NEUROIMAGING DATA. THE WORKING GROUP DEVELOPS MODELS AND TOOLS FACILITATING THE STRUCTURED INTERCHANGE OF NEUROIMAGING META DATA AND IS MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS A UNIFIED SET OF TOOLS FOR SUCH DATA AND META DATA EXCHANGE. WE REPORT ON THE KEY COMPONENTS REQUIRED FOR INTEGRATED ACCESS TO RAW AND DERIVED NEUROIMAGING DATA AS WELL AS ASSOCIATED META DATA AND PROVENANCE ACROSS NEUROIMAGING RESOURCES. THE COMPONENTS INCLUDE (1) A STRUCTURED TERMINOLOGY THAT PROVIDES SEMANTIC CONTEXT TO DATA, (2) A FORMAL DATA MODEL FOR NEUROIMAGING WITH ROBUST TRACKING OF DATA PROVENANCE, (3) A WEB SERVICE BASED APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (API) THAT PROVIDES A CONSISTENT MECHANISM TO ACCESS AND QUERY THE DATA MODEL, AND (4) A PROVENANCE LIBRARY THAT CAN BE USED FOR THE EXTRACTION OF PROVENANCE DATA BY IMAGE ANALYSTS AND IMAGING SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS.

DATA FROM THE EUROPEAN PROSPECTIVE INVESTIGATION INTO CANCER AND NUTRITION (EPIC) COHORT INCLUDING 477,206 SUBJECTS (29.8% MALE) RECRUITED FROM TEN WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WAS ANALYZED. FLAVONOID, LIGNAN AND NEAC INTAKES WERE CALCULATED USING A COMPILATION OF EXISTING FOOD COMPOSITION DATABASES LINKED TO DIETARY INFORMATION FROM VALIDATED DIETARY QUESTIONNAIRES. DIETARY NEAC WAS BASED ON FERRIC REDUCING ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY (FRAP) AND TOTAL RADICAL TRAPPING ANTIOXIDANT PARAMETER (TRAP). HEPATITIS B/C STATUS WAS MEASURED IN A NESTED CASE CONTROL SUBSET. DURING A MEAN FOLLOW UP OF 11 YEARS, 191 INCIDENT HCC CASES (66.5% MEN) WERE IDENTIFIED. USING COX REGRESSION, MULTIVARIABLE ADJUSTED MODELS SHOWED A BORDERLINE NONSIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION OF HCC WITH TOTAL FLAVONOID INTAKE (HIGHEST VERSUS LOWEST TERTILE, HR0.65, 95% CI: 0.40 1.04; P(TREND)0.065), BUT NOT WITH LIGNANS. AMONG FLAVONOID SUBCLASSES, FLAVANOLS WERE INVERSELY ASSOCIATED WITH HCC RISK (HR0.62, 95% CI: 0.39 0.99; P(TREND)0.06). DIETARY NEAC WAS INVERSELY ASSOCIATED WITH HCC (FRAP: HR 0.50, 95% CI: 0.31 0.81; P(TREND)0.001; TRAP: HR 0.49, 95% CI: 0.31 0.79; P(TREND)0.002), BUT STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE WAS LOST AFTER EXCLUSION OF THE FIRST 2 YEARS OF FOLLOW UP. THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT HIGHER INTAKE OF DIETARY FLAVANOLS AND ANTIOXIDANTS MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH A REDUCED HCC RISK. WHATS NEW? COFFEE, TEA, FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, AND CERTAIN OTHER FOODS MAY PROTECT AGAINST HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA (HCC), THANKS TO THEIR ANTIOXIDANT INGREDIENTS. THIS STUDY LENDS FRESH SUPPORT TO THAT IDEA, REVEALING SPECIFICALLY THAT DIETARY FLAVANOLS, WHICH POSSESS ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY, COULD PLAY A FAVOURABLE ROLE IN HCC PREVENTION. DIETARY ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY FROM COFFEE INTAKE IN PARTICULAR WAS FOUND TO BE INVERSELY ASSOCIATED WITH HCC RISK, THOUGH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE WAS LOST AFTER EXCLUSION OF THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF FOLLOW UP. ASSESSMENT OF THE BIOAVAILABILITY OF FLAVONOIDS AND OTHER ANTIOXIDANTS IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM LINKS BETWEEN ANTIOXIDANT INTAKE AND HCC RISK.	***

WE QUANTIFIED CANCER RISK IN RELATIVES OF CHILDREN WITH CANCER TO DETERMINE EVIDENCE OF FAMILIAL AGGREGATION AND TO INFORM RISK ASSESSMENT AND COUNSELING FOR FAMILIES. ODDS RATIOS THAT REFLECT RISK WERE OBTAINED USING CONDITIONAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS ADJUSTING FOR NUMBER OF BIOLOGICAL RELATIVES, THEIR DEGREE OF GENETIC RELATEDNESS AND THEIR PERSON YEARS AT RISK. FIRST DEGREE RELATIVES (PRIMARILY SIBLINGS) OF PEDIATRIC CASES FACED A TWOFOLD INCREASED RISK OF A CANCER DIAGNOSIS BEFORE AGE 19, WHICH EXTENDED TO THEIR SECOND DEGREE RELATIVES (P < 10( 4), RESPECTIVELY). FURTHERMORE, FIRST DEGREE RELATIVES OF CHILDREN DIAGNOSED BEFORE AGE 5 HAD A 3.6 FOLD INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING PEDIATRIC CANCER (P < 10( 7)), SECOND DEGREE RELATIVES OF VERY YOUNG (UNDER AGE 5) CASES WERE AT 2.5 FOLD RISK (P < 10( 4)) AND THIRD DEGREE RELATIVES WERE AT TWOFOLD RISK (P < 10( 3)) OF CHILDHOOD CANCER. ALTHOUGH FIRST DEGREE RELATIVES OF PEDIATRIC CASES HAVE A SLIGHT INCREASED RISK OF ADULT TUMORS, WHEN THEY DO DEVELOP CANCER THEY HAVE A 1.7 FOLD RISK OF DEVELOPING A TUMOR IN THE LI FRAUMENI SPECTRUM. OUR FINDINGS SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS OF FAMILIAL AGGREGATION IN PEDIATRIC CANCER AND SUGGEST THAT A HIGHER PERCENT OF CHILDHOOD CANCERS MAY BE RELATED TO HEREDITARY SYNDROMES THAN ARE ADULT CANCERS. WE ENCOURAGE THE COLLECTION OF A FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY THAT IS ROUTINELY UPDATED FOR ALL PEDIATRIC CANCER PATIENTS, AND THAT FAMILIES WITH EARLY ONSET ADULT CANCERS OR CLUSTERS OF SEVERAL CANCERS ARE REFERRED FOR GENETIC COUNSELING. WHATS NEW? CHILDHOOD CANCER, ALTHOUGH RELATIVELY RARE COMPARED TO ADULTHOOD CANCERS, IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN CHILDREN UP TO 14 YEARS OF AGE. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE HEREDITARY COMPONENTS OF THE DISEASE. USING A LARGE POPULATION BASED GENEALOGICAL DATABASE IN THE US STATE UTAH, CURTIN AND COLLEAGUES REPORT THAT CHILDREN WITH CANCER HAVE AN INCREASED RISK FOR POSITIVE CANCER FAMILY HISTORY AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. SIBLINGS OF PATIENTS DIAGNOSED BEFORE AGE FIVE HAVE A 3.6 FOLD CHILDHOOD CANCER RISK. NOTABLY, A SECOND REPORT IN THIS ISSUE OF IJC ALSO INVESTIGATED RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHILDHOOD CANCER AND SHOWS AN INCREASED RISK OF ADULTHOOD CANCER IN RELATIVES OF CHILDREN WITH CANCER (NEALE ET AL.). A RESULTING CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION IS THAT A THREE GENERATION FAMILY HISTORY BE COLLECTED AND UPDATED FOR ALL PEDIATRIC PATIENTS, AND THAT FAMILIES WITH CLUSTERS OF SEVERAL CANCERS ARE REFERRED TO GENETIC COUNSELING.	***

AS PCA IS A GLOBAL APPROACH DEALING WITH ALL PIXEL INTENSITIES, IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET FINER DETAILS FROM THE EAR IMAGE. THE CONCEPT OF INFORMATION SETS IS INTRODUCED IN THIS PAPER SO AS TO HAVE LEVERAGE OVER THE LOCAL INFORMATION. THESE SETS ARE BASED ON THE GRANULARIZATION OF THE EAR IMAGE IN THE FORM OF WINDOWS. THE FEATURES BASED ON THESE SETS ALLOW US TO CHANGE THE LOCAL INFORMATION WHICH GOES INTO LPIC AS THE INPUT. THUS LPIC NOT ONLY USES THIS LOCAL INFORMATION BUT ALSO HELPS TO REDUCE THE DIMENSIONS OF THE DEDUCED FEATURES FAR LESS THAN THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED WITH PCA. FOR THE EXTRACTION OF SPARSE INFORMATION FROM EAR, FEATURES SUCH AS EFFECTIVE INFORMATION (EI), ENERGY FEATURE (EF), SIGMOID FEATURE (SF), MULTI QUADRATIC FEATURE (MQD) ARE DERIVED AND THEN LPIC IS APPLIED TO GET THE REDUCED NUMBER OF FEATURES. INNER PRODUCT CLASSIFIER (IPC) IS DEVELOPED FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF THESE FEATURES. THE EXPERIMENTS CARRIED OUT ON CONSTRAINED AND UNCONSTRAINED DATABASES SHOW THAT LPIC IS EFFECTIVE NOT ONLY UNDER THE IDEAL CONDITIONS BUT ALSO UNDER THE UNCONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENT.

VAST MAJORITY OF THE RESEARCH IN THIS AREA FOCUSES ON THE USAGE OR DEVELOPMENT OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES. BY MEANS OF THE INTERNET AND DATABASE TECHNOLOGIES, HUGE AMOUNT OF DATA ABOUT MARKETS AND CUSTOMERS HAS NOW BECOME AVAILABLE TO BE EXPLOITED AND THIS ENABLES RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS TO MAKE USE OF SOPHISTICATED DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES APART FROM THE TRADITIONAL MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL TOOLS. THESE SOPHISTICATED TECHNIQUES ARE A FAMILY OF EITHER DATA MINING OR MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH. RECENT RESEARCH SHOWS A TENDENCY TOWARDS THE USAGE OF THEM INTO DIFFERENT BUSINESS AND MARKETING PROBLEMS, PARTICULARLY IN SEGMENTATION. SOFT COMPUTING, AS A FAMILY OF DATA MINING TECHNIQUES, HAS BEEN RECENTLY STARTED TO BE EXPLOITED IN THE AREA OF SEGMENTATION AND IT STANDS OUT AS A POTENTIAL AREA THAT MAY BE ABLE TO SHAPE THE FUTURE OF SEGMENTATION RESEARCH. IN THIS ARTICLE, THE CURRENT APPLICATIONS OF SOFT COMPUTING TECHNIQUES IN SEGMENTATION PROBLEM ARE REVIEWED BASED ON CERTAIN CRITICAL FACTORS INCLUDING THE ONES RELATED TO THE SEGMENTATION EFFECTIVENESS THAT EVERY SEGMENTATION STUDY SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. THE CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF 42 EMPIRICAL STUDIES REVEALS THAT THE USAGE OF SOFT COMPUTING IN SEGMENTATION PROBLEM IS STILL IN ITS EARLY STAGES AND THE ABILITY OF THESE STUDIES TO GENERATE KNOWLEDGE MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT. GIVEN THESE FINDINGS, IT CAN BE SUGGESTED THAT THERE IS MORE TO DIG FOR IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MORE MANAGERIALLY INTERPRETABLE AND ACCEPTABLE RESULTS IN FURTHER STUDIES.

DISCOVERING MEANINGFUL PATTERNS FROM THEM IS DESIRABLE AND STILL REMAINS A BIG CHALLENGE. TO THIS END, SPECTRAL CLUSTERING HAS ESTABLISHED ITSELF AS A VERY USEFUL TOOL FOR DATA ANALYSIS. IT CONSIDERS THE MANIFOLD GEOMETRICAL STRUCTURE OF THE DATA AND DESIRES TO ESTIMATE THE INTRINSIC MANIFOLD. HOWEVER, THERE EXISTS NO PRINCIPLED WAY FOR ESTIMATING SUCH MANIFOLD. THUS, THE CLUSTERING PERFORMANCE MIGHT EVEN DEGRADE SERIOUSLY WHEN THE ESTIMATED MANIFOLD DEVIATES FAR FROM THE INTRINSIC MANIFOLD. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, WE PROPOSE TO EMPLOY COMPOSITE MANIFOLD TO APPROXIMATE THE INTRINSIC MANIFOLD AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THIS COMPOSITE MANIFOLD IS DERIVED FROM A CONVEX COMBINATION OF SOME PRE GIVEN CANDIDATE MANIFOLDS IN A CONVEX HULL. THE DIVERSITY NATURE OF THESE MANIFOLDS PROVIDES RICHER STRUCTURE INFORMATION, WHICH IS HELPFUL TO MAXIMALLY ESTIMATE THE INTRINSIC MANIFOLD. BESIDES, TRADITIONAL SPECTRAL CLUSTERING NEGLECTS THE DISCRIMINANT INFORMATION LATENT IN THE DATA SPACE, SO WE INCORPORATE THE LOCALLY DISCRIMINATIVE STRUCTURE INTO THE PARTITION MATRIX BY EXPLICITLY USING LOCAL LINEAR REGRESSION, FOR BETTER CLUSTERING. THEREFORE, IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT AN INTEGRATED CLUSTERING APPROACH NAMED SPECTRAL CLUSTERING VIA COMPOSITE MANIFOLD AND LOCAL DISCRIMINANT LEARNING, REFERRED TO AS SCCL FOR SHORT, WHICH ADDRESSES THE AFOREMENTIONED TWO PROBLEMS. TO OPTIMIZE THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION, AN ALTERNATING OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK IS ADOPTED TO DERIVE BOTH THE CLUSTER MEMBERSHIP MATRIX AND THE COMPOSITE MANIFOLD COEFFICIENT.

THE MOLECULAR GEOMETRIES OF FIVE HCOOH...C6H6 COMPLEXES AND CORRESPONDING BENCHMARK TOTAL INTERACTION ENERGIES AT THE CCSD(T)/CBS LEVEL ARE TAKEN FROM LITERATURE (ZHAO ET AL., J. CHEM. THEORY COMPUT. 2009, 5, 2726). ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS OF LMO EDA WITH THE MP2 METHOD, THE DISPERSION ENERGIES ARE FOUND TO BE AS IMPORTANT AS THE ELECTROSTATIC ENERGIES FOR THE TOTAL INTERACTION ENERGIES OF THE FIVE HCOOH...C6H6 COMPLEXES. BASED ON LMO EDA WITH THE DOUBLE HYBRID DENSITY FUNCTIONALS OF B2PLYP, B2K PLYP, B2T PLYP, AND B2GP PLYP COMPUTATIONS, TWO NEW PARAMETERS FOR THE FRAMEWORK OF B2PLYP ARE EXTRAPOLATED. THESE TWO NEW PARAMETERS ARE TESTED WITH OTHER 10 COMPLEXES INVOLVING C6H6 (CRITTENDEN, J. PHYS. CHEM.

THIS STUDY PRESENTS AN OVERVIEW OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF STRATEGIES FOR FOLLOW UP OF DLBCL PATIENTS RECEIVING RITUXIMAB AND DOCUMENTS THE CURRENT STATE OF KNOWLEDGE ON EFFICACY AND SAFETY IN THIS POPULATION. A HIGHLY SENSITIVE STRATEGY WAS USED TO IDENTIFY SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS (RCTS) IN THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE, LILACS, MEDLINE, AND SCIRUS DATABASES. A HANDSEARCH OF MEDICAL AND GOVERNMENT AGENCY WEBSITES WAS ALSO CONDUCTED. SEVEN STUDIES WERE INCLUDED, AMONG THEM THERE WERE RCTS OF PATIENTS WHO USED CHOP/CHOP LIKE CHEMOTHERAPY PLUS RITUXIMAB FOR THREE TO EIGHT CYCLES EVERY 14 TO 21 DAYS AS INDUCTION THERAPY, WHEREAS SOME STUDIES USED MAINTENANCE THERAPY FOR 3 TO 24 MONTHS. ONLY ONE STUDY DESCRIBED A FOLLOW UP MODEL FOR MANAGEMENT OF ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS. THE BENEFITS OF RITUXIMAB FOR INDUCTION THERAPY OF DLBCL WERE DEMONSTRATED, ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE OVERALL SURVIVAL OF HIGH RISK PATIENTS OR THOSE WITH HIV RELATED LYMPHOMA. RITUXIMAB THERAPY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED RATES OF FEVER, INFECTION, AND GRADE 3/4 HEMATOLOGICAL TOXICITY, AS WELL AS HIGHER INFECTION RELATED MORTALITY IN HIV POSITIVE PATIENTS. ALTHOUGH ONE STUDY ADDRESSED THE MANAGEMENT OF ADVERSE REACTIONS TO RITUXIMAB, OUR SEARCH DID NOT YIELD ANY PUBLICATIONS ON SYSTEMATIC FOLLOW UP STRATEGIES FOR THESE PATIENTS. THIS FINDING SUGGESTS THAT SUCH INSTRUMENTS SHOULD BE DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED TO OPTIMIZE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND LONG TERM SAFETY OF NOVEL THERAPIES.	***

KNOWLEDGE OF PATTERNS AND TRENDS IN THIS BODY OF RESEARCH WOULD INFORM FUTURE RESEARCH. HOWEVER, THERE IS LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CHARACTERISTICS OR PATTERNS OF QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN APHASIA.AIMS: IN ORDER TO DESCRIBE QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN APHASIA, A REVIEW OF THE APHASIA LITERATURE FROM 1993 TO 2013 WAS UNDERTAKEN. STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED USING A VARIETY OF SEARCH TERMS FOR THE FOLLOWING ELECTRONIC DATABASES: PUBMED, CINAHL, PSYCHINFO, WEB OF SCIENCE AND COMDISDOME. A TOTAL OF 78 ARTICLES THAT MET THE REVIEW CRITERIA WERE IDENTIFIED AND DATA WERE EXTRACTED IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS: TOPIC OF STUDY, PARTICIPANTS, DATA COLLECTION, RESEARCH DESIGN AND DATA ANALYSIS.MAIN CONTRIBUTION: PUBLICATION OF QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN APHASIA HAS INCREASED SINCE 1993 AND CONTRIBUTED TO AN IMPORTANT DATABASE REGARDING PHENOMENA ASSOCIATED WITH LIFE WITH APHASIA. THE MOST PREVALENT RESEARCH TOPICS RELATE TO THE EXPERIENCE OF APHASIA, ACTIVITIES OR PARTICIPATION OF PEOPLE WITH APHASIA, PERCEPTIONS OF INTERVENTION OR OUTCOMES, PERCEIVED GOALS OR NEEDS AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. PEOPLE WITH APHASIA WERE THE MOST FREQUENT PARTICIPANTS. A MAJORITY OF STUDIES EMPLOYED GENERIC QUALITATIVE METHODS INDEPENDENT OF A TRADITIONAL QUALITATIVE PHILOSOPHY. INTERVIEW WAS THE MOST PREVALENT DATA COLLECTION METHOD, AND FEW STUDIES REPORTED METHODS OF DETERMINING IF THE AMOUNT OF DATA WERE SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE STUDY AIMS. THE DEPTH OF INTERPRETATION (LEVEL OF ANALYSIS) VARIED ACROSS STUDIES FROM CONCRETE CATEGORY LISTINGS TO HIGHER LEVEL EXPLANATORY THEMES.CONCLUSIONS: DESPITE THE VARIATION ACROSS STUDIES, IDENTIFIED TRENDS PROVIDED VALUABLE INFORMATION AND RAISED INTERESTING QUESTIONS FOR DEBATE. QUESTIONS ARE POSED FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATION SUCH AS SHOULD APHASIA RESEARCHERS MORE FREQUENTLY APPLY METHODS FROM ESTABLISHED QUALITATIVE TRADITIONS? AND SHOULD APHASIA RESEARCH INCLUDE A WIDER VARIETY OF DATA COLLECTION METHODS? QUESTIONS WERE RAISED REGARDING TERMINOLOGY (E.G., THEMES VERSUS CATEGORIES) AND DEPTH OF INTERPRETATION IN QUALITATIVE STUDIES. THE FINDINGS ALSO PROVIDE CONCRETE DIRECTION; FOR EXAMPLE, QUALITATIVE RESEARCHERS MIGHT IMPROVE THE REPORTING OF METHODS FOR DETERMINING DATA SUFFICIENCY.	***

STONE COMPOSITION DATA WAS SEPARATED INTO GENDER AND AGE GROUPS RESULTS FROM THE 791 STONES ANALYSED BETWEEN 2009 AND 2011, CALCIUM OXALATE REMAINS THE DOMINANT TYPE ACCOUNTING FOR 64% OF STONES IN OUR DATASET, WHICH COMPARES TO 68% FROM BOTH THE 1970S AND 1980S. URIC ACID STONES CONTRIBUTED 16% OF CONTEMPORARY STONE COMPOSITIONS, COMPARABLE TO 16% IN THE 1970S AND 17% IN THE 1980S. STRUVITE STONES SHOWED A DECREASING TREND FROM 14% IN THE 1970S, TO 12% IN THE 1980S AND 7% IN THE CURRENT DATA. FOR STRUVITE STONES, WHILE THE FEMALE 21 30 AGE GROUP WAS THE MOST PROLIFIC FOR STRUVITE STONE FORMATION IN THE 1980S, THE PEAK GROUP IN CONTEMPORANEOUS RECORDS IS 61 70 YEAR OLD MEN. CONCLUSION STONE COMPOSITION IN AUSTRALIA HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY STATIC OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS. MODIFICATIONS IN DIET AND BODY HABITUS HAVE NOT RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE PROPORTION OF URIC ACID AND CALCIUM OXALATE STONES DETECTED. THE DECREASING TREND IN THE PROPORTION OF STRUVITE STONES MOST LIKELY REFLECTS IMPROVED MANAGEMENT OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS WITHIN THE AUSTRALIAN POPULATION.	***

FIRST, A FACE IMAGE DATABASE WAS CONSTRUCTED FROM PAIRS OF FULL FACE PORTRAITS OF TARGET SUBJECTS TAKEN AT THE MOMENT OF DECISION MAKING IN A PRISONERS DILEMMA GAME (PDG) AND IN A PRECEDING NEUTRAL TASK. IMAGE PAIRS WITH NO DEFICIENCIES (N67) WERE STANDARDIZED FOR ORIENTATION AND LUMINANCE. THEN, CONFIDENCE IN DEFECTOR AND COOPERATOR RECOGNITION WAS TESTED WITH IMAGE RATING IN A DIFFERENT GROUP OF LAY JUDGES (N62). RESULTS INDICATE THAT (1) DEFECTORS WERE BETTER RECOGNIZED (58% VS. 47%), (2) THEY LOOKED DIFFERENT FROM COOPERATORS (P<.01), (3) MALES BUT NOT FEMALES EVALUATED THE IMAGES WITH A RELATIVE BIAS TOWARDS THE COOPERATOR CATEGORY (P<.01), AND (4) FEMALES WERE MORE CONFIDENT IN DETECTING DEFECTORS (P<.05). ACCORDING TO FACIAL MICROEXPRESSION ANALYSIS, DEFECTION WAS STRONGLY LINKED WITH DEPRESSED LOWER LIPS AND LESS OPENED EYES. SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE INTENSITY OF MICROMIMICS AND THE RATING OF IMAGES IN THE COOPERATOR DEFECTOR DIMENSION. IN SUMMARY, FACIAL EXPRESSIONS CAN BE CONSIDERED AS RELIABLE INDICATORS OF MOMENTARY SOCIAL DISPOSITIONS IN THE PDG. FEMALES MAY EXHIBIT AN EVOLUTIONARY BASED OVERESTIMATION BIAS TO DETECTING SOCIAL VISUAL CUES OF THE DEFECTOR FACE.	***

THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE FATE OF LAGBS IN A UNIT WITH OVER A DECADE OF EXPERIENCE IN THEIR USE. PATIENT FACTORS RELATED TO THE NEED FOR, AND TIMING OF, BAND REMOVAL WERE INVESTIGATED. METHODSA PROSPECTIVELY MAINTAINED DATABASE WAS USED TO IDENTIFY ALL PATIENTS WITH A LAGB. PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, NEED FOR BAND REMOVAL AND BAND SURVIVAL WERE EXAMINED. LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELLING WAS DONE AND KAPLAN MEIER CURVES WERE CALCULATED FOR BAND SURVIVAL. RESULTSBETWEEN 2000 AND 2012, 674 BANDS WERE PLACED IN 665 PATIENTS. OF THESE, 143 (21<BOLD>2</BOLD> PER CENT) WERE REMOVED. THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN RATES OF REMOVAL BY SEX (P0<BOLD>910</BOLD>). THE HIGHEST RATES OF REMOVAL WERE IN PATIENTS AGED LESS THAN 40YEARS (26<BOLD>7</BOLD> PER CENT), AND THOSE WITH A BMI GREATER THAN 60KG/M(2) (28<BOLD>6</BOLD> PER CENT). EARLIER BAND REMOVAL WAS SEEN IN YOUNGER PATIENTS (P0<BOLD>002</BOLD>). RATES OF REMOVAL INCREASED LINEARLY BY EARLIER YEAR OF PLACEMENT. OF BANDS PLACED 4 OR MORE YEARS PREVIOUSLY, 35<BOLD>0</BOLD> PER CENT REQUIRED REMOVAL. EIGHTY THREE PATIENTS (58<BOLD>0</BOLD> PER CENT) WHO HAD A LAGB REMOVED WENT ON TO HAVE A FURTHER BARIATRIC PROCEDURE (BAND TO BYPASS, 66; BAND TO SLEEVE, 17).

METHODSWE SEARCHED MULTIPLE ELECTRONIC DATABASES FOR PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS RELATED TO SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF TT VS ST. RELATIVE RISK (RR) WAS ESTIMATED WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) BASED ON AN INTENTION TO TREAT ANALYSIS. WE CONSIDERED THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES: RECURRENT HYPERTHYROIDISM, OPHTHALMOPATHY PROGRESSION, TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT HYPOPARATHYROIDISM, TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT RECURRENT LARYNGEAL NERVE PALSY (RLNP) AND POST OPERATIVE BLEEDING. RESULTSFOUR TRIALS WITH 674 PATIENTS (342 WITH TT, 332 WITH ST) WERE ANALYSED. ALTHOUGH THE OVERALL RATES OF OPHTHALMOPATHY PROGRESSION WERE SIMILAR BETWEEN TT AND ST (RR 092, 95% CI050 171; P080), TT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN RECURRENT HYPERTHYROIDISM (RR 014, 95% CI005 041; P<001). THE POOLED RR OF POST OPERATIVE BLEEDING FOR TT WAS SIMILAR TO THAT FOR ST (RR 032, 95% CI005 196; P022). HOWEVER, COMPARING WITH ST, THE RR OF TEMPORARY HYPOPARATHYROIDISM WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FOR TT (RR 266, 95% CI189 373; P<001).

DATA SOURCES: SEARCHES WERE RUN IN 15 ELECTRONIC DATABASES ALONG WITH HAND SEARCHING. THE SEARCH INCLUDED ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH TO DECEMBER 2011. REVIEW METHODS: KEY TERMS INCLUDED: POSTURE, SITTING, SITTING POSTURE, SEATED POSTURE, SEATED POSTURAL CONTROL, SITTING POSITION, SEATING, WHEELCHAIR(S), OUTCOME AND ASSESS(MENT). THE PRISMA STATEMENT WAS FOLLOWED WITH INCLUSION CRITERIA SET A PRIORI. TWO REVIEWERS INDEPENDENTLY SCREENED TITLES, REVIEWED ABSTRACTS AND IDENTIFIED FULL TEXT ARTICLES THAT MET CRITERIA. DATA EXTRACTION INCLUDED TOOL DESCRIPTION AND CLINICAL UTILITY. TWO QUALITY RATING SCALES WERE USED TO EVALUATE CONDUCT OF THE STUDIES AND PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF THE TOOLS. RESULTS: OF THE 497 TITLES FOUND IN THE SEARCH, 29 FULL TEXT ARTICLES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA AND 19 TOOLS WERE IDENTIFIED. TOOLS REPRESENTED ALL COMPONENTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF FUNCTIONING, DISABILITY AND HEALTH FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH (ICF CY), WITH EMPHASIS ON BODY STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION AND ACTIVITY COMPONENTS. EVIDENCE SUPPORTING RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY VARIED, WITH SMALL SAMPLE SIZES INFLUENCING QUALITY RATINGS. EVIDENCE OF THE TOOLS RELIABILITY WAS MORE PREVALENT THAN EVIDENCE OF THE TOOLS VALIDITY.

NEW ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OFTEN REQUIRE THAT ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS TO FISH POPULATIONS BE MINIMIZED. WITHOUT LONG TERM FIELD DATA, POPULATION EVALUATIONS MAY INCORRECTLY INDICATE ADVERSE IMPACTS WHERE NONE EXIST OR NO IMPACT WHERE ONE IS LIKELY TO OCCUR. SEVERAL ELECTRIC UTILITY COMPANIES HAVE FUNDED THE OHIO RIVER ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM, WHICH HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR OVER 40 YEARS AND CONSISTS OF FISH, HABITAT, AND WATER QUALITY STUDIES AT MULTIPLE POWER PLANT SITES ON THE MAINSTEM OHIO RIVER. SAMPLING INCLUDES SEASONAL NIGHT TIME ELECTROFISHING AND DAYTIME BEACH SEINING AT THREE UPSTREAM AND THREE DOWNSTREAM LOCATIONS NEAR EACH PLANT. THE LONG TERM NATURE OF THE PROGRAM ALLOWS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AQUATIC COMMUNITY INDICES TO SUPPORT EVALUATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY PERFORMANCE, THE COLLABORATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLIANCE METRICS, AND THE ASSESSMENT OF FISH POPULATION TRENDS. STUDIES HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE OHIO RIVER FISH COMMUNITY HAS IMPROVED IN RESPONSE TO BETTER WATER QUALITY AND THAT POWER PLANT FISH ENTRAINMENT AND IMPINGEMENT AND THERMAL DISCHARGES HAVE HAD LITTLE OR NO MEASUREABLE IMPACT. THROUGH COLLABORATION AND THE USE OF LONG TERM DATA, $6.3 MILLION IN MONITORING COSTS HAVE BEEN SAVED DURING RECENT FISH IMPINGEMENT STUDIES. THE ABILITY TO ACCESS A MULTIYEAR FISH ABUNDANCE DATABASE, WITH ITS ASSOCIATED DATA ON AGE, GROWTH, AND FECUNDITY, IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF SUCH EVALUATIONS AND REDUCES THE NEED FOR EXTENSIVE FIELD SAMPLING AT INDIVIDUAL LOCATIONS.	***

THIS RESEARCH EXAMINED CANADIAN ENGOS THAT COLLECT THEIR OWN DATA ON WATER QUALITY WITH RESPECT TO WATER QUALITY MONITORING ACTIVITIES AND INFORMATION NEEDS. THIS WORK HAD A TWOFOLD PURPOSE: (1) TO ENHANCE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE CANADIAN ENGOS OPERATING IN THE REALM OF WATER QUALITY MONITORING AND (2) TO GUIDE AND INFORM DEVELOPMENT OF WEB BASED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS (GIS) TO SUPPORT WATER QUALITY MONITORING, PARTICULARLY USING BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATE PROTOCOLS. A STRUCTURED TELEPHONE SURVEY WAS ADMINISTERED ACROSS 10 CANADIAN PROVINCES TO 21 ENGOS THAT UNDERTAKE WATER QUALITY MONITORING. THIS GENERATED INFORMATION ABOUT BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES OF DATA SHARING, COMMONLY COLLECTED METRICS, HUMAN RESOURCES, AND PERCEPTIONS OF VOLUNTEER COLLECTED DATA. RESULTS ARE PRESENTED ON AN AGGREGATE LEVEL AND AMONG DIFFERENT GROUPS OF RESPONDENTS. USE OF GEOMATICS TECHNOLOGY WAS NOT CONSISTENT AMONG RESPONDENTS, AND WE FOUND NO NOTEWORTHY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONS THAT DID AND DID NOT USE GIS TOOLS. ABOUT ONE THIRD OF RESPONDENTS DID NOT EMPLOY COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS (INCLUDING DATABASES AND SPREADSHEETS) TO SUPPORT DATA MANAGEMENT, ANALYSIS, AND SHARING. DESPITE THEIR ADVANTAGE AS A HOLISTIC WATER QUALITY INDICATOR, BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATES (BMIS) WERE NOT WIDELY EMPLOYED IN STREAM MONITORING. ALTHOUGH BMIS ARE PARTICULARLY SUITABLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CITIZEN EDUCATION, FEW ORGANIZATIONS COLLECTED THIS METRIC, DESPITE HAVING PUBLIC EDUCATION AND AWARENESS AS PART OF THEIR MANDATE.	***

WE COMPARED THESE RESULTS WITH AVAILABLE DATA (DEMOGRAPHIC FEATURES, CAUSATIVE AGENTS, CASE FATALITY RATIO) OBTAINED THROUGH THE FRENCH NATIONAL HOSPITAL DISCHARGE 2007 DATABASE (PMSI), IN ORDER TO EVALUATE IT AS A SURVEILLANCE TOOL FOR ENCEPHALITIS. CAUSATIVE AGENTS WERE IDENTIFIED IN 52% OF CASES IN THE STUDY, AND 38% IN PMSI (P<0.001). THE INCIDENCE OF ENCEPHALITIS IN FRANCE IN 2007 WAS ESTIMATED AS 2.6 CASES/100 000 INHABITANTS. HSV AND VZV WERE THE MOST FREQUENT AETIOLOGICAL AGENTS IN BOTH DATABASES WITH SIMILAR RATES. LISTERIA MONOCYTOGENES AND MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS WERE LESS FREQUENT IN PMSI THAN IN THE STUDY (LISTERIA: 2% VS. 5%, P0.001; MYCOBACTERIUM: 2% VS. 8%, P<0.001). THE CASE FATALITY RATIOS WERE SIMILAR, EXCEPT FOR LISTERIA (46% IN THE STUDY VS. 16%). NEVERTHELESS, DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF CASE DEFINITIONS AND A POSSIBLE MISCLASSIFICATION WEAKENING PMSI DATA, WE SUGGEST THAT PMSI MAY BE USED AS A BASIC SURVEILLANCE TOOL AT A LIMITED COST.	***

METHODS: OUR STUDY FEATURED A STUDY COHORT AND A COMPARISON COHORT. THE STUDY COHORT CONSISTED OF ALL PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED HE BETWEEN 1997 AND 2010, COMPILED FROM UNIVERSAL INSURANCE CLAIMS DATA ON PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION TAKEN FROM THE NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE RESEARCH DATABASE. THE COMPARISON COHORT COMPRISED THE REMAINING HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS WITHOUT ENCEPHALOPATHY. THE FOLLOW UP PERIOD WAS TERMINATED FOLLOWING THE DEVELOPMENT OF EPILEPSY, DEATH, WITHDRAWAL FROM THE NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM, OR THE END OF 2010. WE DETERMINED THE CUMULATIVE INCIDENCES AND HAZARD RATIOS (HRS) OF EPILEPSY DEVELOPMENT. RESULTS: THE INCIDENCE OF SUBSEQUENT EPILEPSY WAS 2.25 FOLD HIGHER IN THE PATIENTS WITH HE THAN IN COMPARISONS (4.17 VS. 1.85 PER 1000 PERSON YEARS), WITH AN ADJUSTED HR OF 2.06 (95% CI 1.66 2.56) IN THE MULTIVARIABLE COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS REGRESSION ANALYSIS. THE INCIDENCE OF EPILEPSY WAS HIGHER IN MEN, YOUNGER PATIENTS WITH HE, AND THOSE WITH BRAIN DISORDERS. CONCLUSIONS: WE FOUND THAT, IN TAIWAN, PATIENTS WITH HE ARE AT AN INCREASED RISK OF SUBSEQUENT EPILEPSY. PHYSICIANS SHOULD BE AWARE OF HES LINK TO EPILEPSY WHEN ASSESSING PATIENTS WITH HE.

A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW IN MEDLINE AND OTHER DATABASE SOURCES UP TO FEBRUARY 2012 WAS CARRIED OUT, AND THE POOLED DATA WERE META ANALYZED. TWELVE STUDIES WERE SYSTEMATICALLY ANALYZED. ONE REPRESENTED LEVEL I, ONE LEVEL II AND TEN LEVEL III EVIDENCE. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF TREATED PATIENTS WAS 1,286. CARTILAGE RECONSTRUCTION WAS USED IN 536, TMF IN 750 CASES. TWO LEVEL III STUDIES SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRE AND POSTOPERATIVE AIR BONE GAP CLOSURE, IN FAVOR OF CARTILAGE GRAFTING. THE MEAN GRAFT INTEGRATION RATE WAS 92.4 % IN THE CARTILAGE GROUP AND 84.3 % IN THE TMF GROUP (P < 0.05). THE RATES OF RE PERFORATIONS WERE 7.6 AND 15.5 %, RESPECTIVELY (P < 0.05). AMONG THE OTHER COMPLICATIONS OF TYPE I TYMPANOPLASTY, RETRACTION POCKETS, OTITIS MEDIA WITH EFFUSION, ANTERIOR BLUNTING, AND GRAFT LATERALIZATION WERE USUALLY SURGICALLY MANAGED, WHEREAS MOST OF THE REST WERE MINOR AND COULD BE DEALT WITH CONSERVATIVELY. THE GRAFT INTEGRATION RATE IN MYRINGOPLASTY IS HIGHER AFTER USING CARTILAGE, IN COMPARISON WITH FASCIA RECONSTRUCTIONS (GRADE C STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATION), AND THE RATE OF RE PERFORATION IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER. ALTHOUGH CARTILAGE IS PRIMARILY USED AS GRAFTING MATERIAL IN CASES OF EUSTACHIAN TUBE DYSFUNCTION, ADHESIVE OTITIS MEDIA, AND SUBTOTAL PERFORATION IN EVERYDAY SURGICAL PRACTICE, A WIDER UTILIZATION FOR THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE TYMPANIC MEMBRANE IN MYRINGOPLASTIES CAN BE RECOMMENDED.	***

FUNCTIONAL CYP1A2 POLYMORPHISMS ARE CONSIDERED TO EXERT SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON THE RISK OF CANCER, BUT THE CONCLUSIONS ARE INCONSISTENT. THREE COMMONLY STUDIED CYP1A2 POLYMORPHISMS, NAMELY RS762551 (A>C), RS2069514 (G>A), AND RS3569413 (T>DELT), WERE SELECTED TO EXPLORE THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH THE RISK OF DEVELOPMENT OF CANCER BY META ANALYSIS OF PUBLISHED CASE CONTROL STUDIES. TWO INVESTIGATORS INDEPENDENTLY SEARCHED THE PUBMED, EMBASE, CHINA NATIONAL KNOWLEDGE INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THE CHINESE BIOMEDICINE DATABASE. SUMMARY ODDS RATIOS (ORS) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (95% CIS) FOR CYP1A2 POLYMORPHISMS AND THE RISK OF CANCER WERE CALCULATED IN A FIXED EFFECTS MODEL (THE MANTEL HAENSZEL METHOD) AND A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL (THE DERSIMONIAN AND LAIRD METHOD) WHEN APPROPRIATE. FOR RS762551, 37 STUDIES WERE ELIGIBLE (16 825 CASES AND 21 513 CONTROLS); FOR RS2069514, 15 STUDIES WERE ELIGIBLE (3677 CASES AND 5127 CONTROLS); AND FOR RS3569413, EIGHT STUDIES WERE ELIGIBLE (1607 CASES AND 2043 CONTROLS). THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT NO SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE RISK OF CANCER WERE FOUND IN ANY MODEL (ALLELE CONTRAST, CODOMINANT, DOMINANT, OR RECESSIVE MODEL) IN TERMS OF RS2069514 AND RS3569413 WHEN ALL STUDIES WERE POOLED INTO A META ANALYSIS. HOWEVER, WHEN STRATIFIED BY CANCER TYPE, A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED RISK OF CANCER WAS ONLY FOUND IN LUNG CANCER FOR RS3569413 (DELT ALLELE VS. T ALLELE: OR1.50, 95% CI1.16 1.95). IN THE SUBGROUP ANALYSIS BY ETHNICITY, A SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED RISK OF CANCER WAS FOUND IN THE CAUCASIAN POPULATION FOR RS3569413 (DELT ALLELE VS. T ALLELE: OR1.63, 95% CI1.01 2.63). WITH RESPECT TO RS762551, WE FOUND THAT CARRIERS OF THE C ALLELE SHOWED AN INCREASED OVERALL RISK OF DEVELOPING CANCER COMPARED WITH A ALLELE CARRIERS (C ALLELE VS. A ALLELE: OR1.08, 95% CI1.01 1.16). FURTHER SUBGROUP ANALYSES SHOWED THAT THE RS762551 POLYMORPHISM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF CANCER IN THE SUBGROUP OF CAUCASIANS (C ALLELE VS. A ALLELE: OR1.14, 95% CI1.00 1.28; DOMINANT MODEL: OR1.19, 95% CI1.02 1.37). THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE RS3569413 POLYMORPHISM OF THE CYP1A2 GENE IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF LUNG CANCER AND THE RS762551 POLYMORPHISM OF THE CYP1A2 GENE MIGHT BE A POTENTIAL BIOMARKER FOR THE RISK OF CANCER AMONG CAUCASIANS. FURTHER LARGE AND WELL DESIGNED STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM THIS CONCLUSION. (C) 2013 WOLTERS KLUWER HEALTH VERTICAL BAR LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS.	***

WE AIMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER PHYSICIAN AND PRACTICE CHARACTERISTICS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ADHERENCE TO THIS RECOMMENDATION.MATERIALS AND METHODSWE USED A LARGE NATIONAL PATHOLOGY DATABASE TO IDENTIFY ALL ADULT PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT DUODENAL BIOPSY DURING 2006 2009. HIERARCHICAL MODELING WAS USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER PROCEDURE VOLUME, THE NUMBER OF GASTROENTEROLOGISTS PER ENDOSCOPY SUITE, AND THE NUMBER OF GASTROENTEROLOGISTS PER CAPITA OF THE ZIP CODE OF THE PRACTICE WERE ASSOCIATED WITH ADHERENCE.RESULTSWE IDENTIFIED 92 580 PATIENTS (67% FEMALE, MEAN AGE 53.5 YEARS) WHO MET OUR INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA. SPECIMENS WERE SUBMITTED BY 669 GASTROENTEROLOGISTS FROM 200 ENDOSCOPY SUITES, LOCATED IN 191 ZIP CODES, WITH A MEAN OF 3.4 GASTROENTEROLOGISTS PER SUITE. ON MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS, A HIGHER PROCEDURE VOLUME WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A DECREASED ADHERENCE [ODDS RATIO (OR) FOR EACH ADDITIONAL 100 PROCEDURES, 0.92; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI), 0.88 0.97; P0.002]. AN INCREASED ADHERENCE WAS REPORTED FOR GASTROENTEROLOGISTS WORKING AT SUITES WITH HIGHER NUMBERS OF GASTROENTEROLOGISTS (OR FOR EACH ADDITIONAL GASTROENTEROLOGIST, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04 1.13; P<0.001) BUT NOT FOR A HIGHER GASTROENTEROLOGIST DENSITY IN THE ZIP CODE OF THE PRACTICE (OR FOR EACH ADDITIONAL GASTROENTEROLOGIST PER CAPITA, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.99 1.03; P0.21).CONCLUSIONHIGH VOLUME PHYSICIANS EXHIBIT LOWER RATES OF ADHERENCE TO BIOPSY GUIDELINES, POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL TIME REQUIRED TO SUBMIT AT LEAST FOUR SPECIMENS. IN CONTRAST, A GREATER NUMBER OF ENDOSCOPISTS WORKING IN AN ENDOSCOPY SUITE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED ADHERENCE, POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF PEER EDUCATION.

AIH DEVELOPED AT A MEAN DURATION OF 4.8 YEARS (RANGE: 1 10) AFTER HCV THERAPY. THREE OF FIVE PATIENTS HAD A SUSTAINED VIRAL RESPONSE TO ANTIVIRAL THERAPY, WHEREAS TWO WERE NONRESPONDERS. ALL PATIENTS WERE TREATED WITH IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE THERAPY AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED WITH AIH. BIOCHEMICAL REMISSION WAS ACHIEVED IN FOUR PATIENTS; HOWEVER, ONE PATIENT HAD AN AGGRESSIVE COURSE AND DIED DESPITE IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE THERAPY.

THE HOSPITALIZATION RATE OF INTRAHEPATIC CCA IS INCREASING; THIS CANCER IS MORE FREQUENT IN MALES THAN IN FEMALES. THE HOSPITALIZATION RATE FOR GALLBLADDER CANCER IS INCREASING WITH AGE. HOWEVER, THE FIGURES FOR EXTRAHEPATIC CCA HAVE REMAINED STABLE OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS. THE DURATION OF SURVIVAL WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER FOR PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT RADICAL SURGERY THAN FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT.CONCLUSIONEFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO PREVENT CCA, BEARING IN MIND THE EMERGING CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS ONSET.

THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF PRESENT WORK WAS TO IDENTIFY LARGE NUMBERS OF GENE ASSOCIATED SNPS USING HIGH THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING IN SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA OF HORN. RNA SEQ ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED ON 2 TISSUES VIZ. HORN CANCER (HC) AND HORN NORMAL (HN) IN KANKREJ BREED OF CATTLE. A TOTAL OF 909,362 READS WITH AVERAGE READ LENGTH OF 405 BP FOR HC AND 583,491 READS WITH AVERAGE READ LENGTH OF 411 BP FOR HN WERE OBTAINED.

METHOD: THE REVIEW IS RESTRICTED TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1997 AND 2007. IT INCLUDES STUDIES THAT REPORTED RANDOMIZED TRIALS (CONTROLLED AND UNCONTROLLED) AND SURVEYS WITH SOME FORM OF OUTCOME MEASURE, WITH OR WITHOUT PROCESS EVALUATION. THE LITERATURE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED ON SIX ELECTRONIC DATABASES. DATA WERE EXTRACTED AND SYNTHESIZED USING A STANDARD DATA EXTRACTION FORM. A NARRATIVE SYNTHESIS WAS CARRIED OUT FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW. THE QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED TRIALS WAS ASSESSED BY CRD GUIDELINES AND CROMBIES CHECKLIST. THE APPLICABILITY OF RESEARCH FINDINGS WAS EVALUATED BY THE RE AIM MODEL. RESULTS: ONE RANDOMIZED CLUSTER TRIAL AND NINE SURVEYS WERE CRITICALLY APPRAISED. THREE MULTI FACETED INTERVENTIONS WERE JUDGED EFFECTIVE WHILE ANOTHER THREE WERE FOUND INEFFECTIVE. TWO OUT OF THE THREE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS USED SERVICE PROVISION AND EDUCATIONAL INPUT. TWO OUT OF THE THREE INEFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS ALSO USED SERVICE PROVISION ALONGSIDE OTHER METHODS INCLUDING SCREENING AND COUNSELLING. FINDINGS OF EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS WERE GENERALIZABLE. CONCLUSION: THE REVIEW SUGGESTS THAT EYE HEALTH EDUCATION AND SERVICE PROVISION LESSEN THE BARRIERS TO SERVICE UPTAKE AND INCREASE THE UPTAKE OF EYE CARE SERVICES. THE ROLE OF COUNSELLING AND SCREENING SERVICES NEEDS FURTHER REVIEW BY LARGE AND GOOD QUALITY STUDIES.	***

MOST NF1 PATIENTS HAVE PRIVATE LOSS OF FUNCTION MUTATIONS SCATTERED ALONG THE NF1 GENE. HERE, WE PRESENT AN ORIGINAL NF1 INVESTIGATION STRATEGY AND REPORT A COMPREHENSIVE MUTATION ANALYSIS OF 565 UNRELATED PATIENTS FROM THE NF FRANCE NETWORK. A NF1 MUTATION WAS IDENTIFIED IN 546 OF THE 565 PATIENTS, GIVING A MUTATION DETECTION RATE OF 97%. THE COMBINED CDNA/DNA APPROACH SHOWED THAT A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF NF1 MISSENSE MUTATIONS (30%) WERE DELETERIOUS BY AFFECTING PRE MRNA SPLICING. MULTIPLEX LIGATION DEPENDENT PROBE AMPLIFICATION ALLOWED THE IDENTIFICATION OF RESTRICTED REARRANGEMENTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MISSED IF ONLY SEQUENCING OR MICROSATELLITE ANALYSIS HAD BEEN PERFORMED. IN FOUR UNRELATED FAMILIES, WE IDENTIFIED TWO DISTINCT NF1 MUTATIONS WITHIN THE SAME FAMILY. THIS FORTUITOUS ASSOCIATION POINTS OUT THE NEED TO PERFORM AN EXHAUSTIVE NF1 SCREENING IN THE CASE OF MOLECULAR DISCORDANT RELATED PATIENTS. A GENOTYPE PHENOTYPE STUDY WAS PERFORMED IN PATIENTS HARBORING A TRUNCATING (N368), IN FRAME SPLICING (N36), OR MISSENSE (N35) MUTATION. THE ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS OF THESE MUTATION TYPES WITH 12 COMMON NF1 CLINICAL FEATURES CONFIRMED A WEAK CONTRIBUTION OF THE ALLELIC HETEROGENEITY OF THE NF1 MUTATION TO THE NF1 VARIABLE EXPRESSIVITY.	***

WE FOUND A HIGH PROPORTION OF VARIANTS IN ARID1B (68%). ALL FOUR PATHOGENIC VARIANTS IN ARID1A APPEARED TO BE MOSAIC. BY USING ALL VARIANTS FROM THE EXOME VARIANT SERVER AS TEST DATA, WE WERE ABLE TO CLASSIFY VARIANTS IN ARID1A, ARID1B, AND SMARCB1 RELIABLY AS BEING PATHOGENIC OR NONPATHOGENIC. FOR SMARCA2, SMARCA4, AND SMARCE1 SEVERAL VARIANTS IN THE EVS REMAINED UNCLASSIFIED, UNDERLINING THE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTAL TESTING. WE HAVE ENTERED ALL VARIANT AND CLINICAL INFORMATION IN LOVD POWERED DATABASES TO FACILITATE FURTHER GENOTYPE PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS, AS THESE WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE UPTAKE OF TARGETED AND UNTARGETED NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING IN DIAGNOSTICS. THE EMERGING PHENOTYPE GENOTYPE CORRELATION IS THAT SMARCB1 PATIENTS HAVE THE MOST MARKED PHYSICAL PHENOTYPE AND SEVERE COGNITIVE AND GROWTH DELAY. THE VARIABILITY IN PHENOTYPE SEEMS MOST MARKED IN ARID1A AND ARID1B PATIENTS. DISTAL LIMBS ANOMALIES ARE MOST MARKED IN ARID1A PATIENTS AND LEAST IN SMARCB1 PATIENTS. NUMBERS ARE SMALL HOWEVER, AND LARGER SERIES ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THIS CORRELATION.	***

PATIENTS UNDERWENT STANDARD OPHTHALMIC EVALUATIONS AFTER PROVIDING INFORMED CONSENT. IN SELECTED PATIENTS, OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY (OCT) AND FUNDUS AUTOFLUORESCENCE IMAGING WERE POSSIBLE. DNA SAMPLES FROM 797 UNRELATED PATIENTS WITH LCA AND 211 WITH THE VARIOUS TYPES OF RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA (RP) WERE SCREENED BY SANGER SEQUENCE ANALYSIS OF ALL LCA5 EXONS AND INTRON/EXON JUNCTIONS. SOME LCA PATIENTS WERE PRESCREENED BY APEX TECHNOLOGY OR SELECTED BASED ON HOMOZYGOSITY MAPPING. IN SILICO ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE PATHOGENICITY OF THE VARIANTS. SEGREGATION ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED WHERE POSSIBLE. PUBLISHED AND NOVEL LCA5 VARIANTS WERE COLLECTED, AMENDED FOR THEIR CORRECT NOMENCLATURE, AND LISTED IN A LEIDEN OPEN VARIATION DATABASE (LOVD). SEQUENCE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED 18 NEW PROBANDS WITH 19 DIFFERENT LCA5 VARIANTS. SEVENTEEN OF THE 19 LCA5 VARIANTS WERE NOVEL. EXCEPT FOR TWO MISSENSE VARIANTS AND ONE SPLICE SITE VARIANT, ALL VARIANTS WERE PROTEIN TRUNCATING MUTATIONS. MOST PATIENTS EXPRESSED A SEVERE PHENOTYPE, TYPICAL OF LCA. HOWEVER, SOME LCA SUBJECTS HAD BETTER VISION AND INTACT INNER SEGMENT/OUTER SEGMENT (IS/OS) JUNCTIONS ON OCT IMAGING. IN TWO FAMILIES WITH LCA5 VARIANTS, THE PHENOTYPE WAS MORE COMPATIBLE WITH EORD WITH AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS DISPLAYING PRESERVED ISLANDS OF RETINAL PIGMENT EPITHELIUM. ONE OF THE FAMILIES WITH A MILDER PHENOTYPE HARBORED A HOMOZYGOUS SPLICE SITE MUTATION; A SECOND FAMILY WAS FOUND TO HAVE A COMBINATION OF A STOP MUTATION AND A MISSENSE MUTATION. THIS IS THE LARGEST LCA5 STUDY TO DATE. WE SEQUENCED 1,008 PATIENTS (797 WITH LCA, 211 WITH ARRP) AND IDENTIFIED 18 PROBANDS WITH LCA5 MUTATIONS. MUTATIONS IN LCA5 ARE A RARE CAUSE OF CHILDHOOD RETINAL DYSTROPHY ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATE TO 2% OF DISEASE IN THIS COHORT, AND THE MAJORITY OF LCA5 MUTATIONS ARE LIKELY NULL. THE LCA5 PROTEIN TRUNCATING MUTATIONS ARE PREDOMINANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH LCA. HOWEVER, IN TWO FAMILIES WITH THE MILDER EORD, THE LCA5 GENE ANALYSIS REVEALED A HOMOZYGOUS SPLICE SITE MUTATION IN ONE AND A STOP MUTATION IN COMBINATION WITH A MISSENSE MUTATION IN A SECOND FAMILY, SUGGESTING THAT THIS MILDER PHENOTYPE IS DUE TO RESIDUAL FUNCTION OF LEBERCILIN AND EXPANDING THE CURRENTLY KNOWN PHENOTYPIC SPECTRUM TO INCLUDE THE MILDER EARLY ONSET RP. SOME PATIENTS HAVE REMAINING FOVEAL CONE STRUCTURES (INTACT IS/OS JUNCTIONS ON OCT IMAGING) AND REMAINING VISUAL ACUITIES, WHICH MAY BODE WELL FOR UPCOMING TREATMENT TRIALS.	***

BASIS VECTORS ARE EXTRACTED BY THE NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION (NMF) METHOD, AND THEN THE NONNEGATIVE LEAST SQUARES METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE THE RECIPE. TO INCREASE THE APPROXIMATION ACCURACY, TWO METHODS ARE PROPOSED. ONE METHOD IS TO INCREASE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE SAMPLES WITH LESS FREQUENT OCCURRENCE. THE OTHER METHOD IS TO SET APPROPRIATE INITIAL VALUES OF THE BASIS VECTORS IN THE NMF METHOD USING CLUSTERING ANALYSIS. THE ACCURACY OF THE ODOR APPROXIMATION IS INCREASED USING THESE METHODS.	***

AUGMENTED R TREE EXTENDS R TREE BY INCLUDING AGGREGATED NONSPATIAL ATTRIBUTES IN INDEX NODES TO ENABLE DOMINANCE CHECKS DURING INDEX TRAVERSAL. DOMINANCE DIAGRAM IS A SOLUTION BASED APPROACH, BY WHICH EACH OBJECT IS ASSOCIATED WITH A PRECOMPUTED NONDOMINANCE SCOPE WHEREIN QUERY POINTS SHOULD HAVE THE CORRESPONDING OBJECT NOT LOCATIONALLY DOMINATED BY ANY OTHER. DOMINANCE DIAGRAM ENABLES SKYLINE QUERIES TO BE EVALUATED VIA PARALLEL AND INDEPENDENT COMPARISONS BETWEEN NONDOMINANCE SCOPES AND QUERY POINTS, PROVIDING VERY HIGH SEARCH EFFICIENCY.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS A NOVEL SKYLINE ALGORITHM SSPL ON BIG DATA. SSPL UTILIZES SORTED POSITIONAL INDEX LISTS WHICH REQUIRE LOW SPACE OVERHEAD TO REDUCE I/O COST SIGNIFICANTLY. THE SORTED POSITIONAL INDEX LIST L J IS CONSTRUCTED FOR EACH ATTRIBUTE A(J) AND IS ARRANGED IN ASCENDING ORDER OF A(J). SSPL CONSISTS OF TWO PHASES. IN PHASE 1, SSPL COMPUTES SCAN DEPTH OF THE INVOLVED SORTED POSITIONAL INDEX LISTS. DURING RETRIEVING THE LISTS IN A ROUND ROBIN FASHION, SSPL PERFORMS PRUNING ON ANY CANDIDATE POSITIONAL INDEX TO DISCARD THE CANDIDATE WHOSE CORRESPONDING TUPLE IS NOT SKYLINE RESULT. PHASE 1 ENDS WHEN THERE IS A CANDIDATE POSITIONAL INDEX SEEN IN ALL OF THE INVOLVED LISTS. IN PHASE 2, SSPL EXPLOITS THE OBTAINED CANDIDATE POSITIONAL INDEXES TO GET SKYLINE RESULTS BY A SELECTIVE AND SEQUENTIAL SCAN ON THE TABLE. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON SYNTHETIC AND REAL DATA SETS SHOW THAT SSPL HAS A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE OVER THE EXISTING SKYLINE ALGORITHMS.	***

DATA GRAPHS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND THEIR INDEXES ARE UPDATED ACCORDINGLY. THIS PAPER STUDIES THE INCREMENTAL MAINTENANCE PROBLEM OF THE MINIMUM BISIMULATION OF A POSSIBLY CYCLIC DATA GRAPH. WHILE CYCLIC GRAPHS ARE UBIQUITOUS AMONG THE DATA ON THE WEB, PREVIOUS WORK ON THE MAINTENANCE PROBLEM HAS MOSTLY FOCUSED ON ACYCLIC GRAPHS.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN DEPLOYMENT RELATED INJURY AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) HAS YIELDED MIXED RESULTS. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF BATTLE INJURY (BI) RELATIVE TO NON BATTLE INJURY (NBI) ON THE MANIFESTATION OF PTSD SYMPTOMS IN MILITARY PERSONNEL AND TO ASSESS THE DEMOGRAPHIC, INJURY SPECIFIC, AND PRE INJURY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH PTSD FOLLOWING A BI. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 3403 PERSONNEL WITH DEPLOYMENT RELATED INJURY (1777 BI AND 1626 NBI) WERE IDENTIFIED FROM THE EXPEDITIONARY MEDICAL ENCOUNTER DATABASE. RECORDS WERE ELECTRONICALLY MATCHED TO POST DEPLOYMENT HEALTH ASSESSMENT (PDHA) DATA COMPLETED 1 6 MONTHS POST INJURY. THE PTSD SCREENING OUTCOME WAS IDENTIFIED USING A FOUR ITEM SCREENING TOOL ON THE PDHA. RESULTS: COMPARED TO THOSE WITH NBI, PERSONNEL WITH BI HAD MORE SEVERE INJURIES, REPORTED HIGHER LEVELS OF COMBAT EXPOSURE, AND HAD HIGHER RATES OF POSITIVE PTSD SCREEN. AFTER ADJUSTING FOR COVARIATES, PERSONNEL WITH BI WERE TWICE AS LIKELY TO SCREEN POSITIVE FOR PTSD COMPARED TO THOSE WITH NBI (ODDS RATIO [OR], 2.10; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 1.60 2.75). IN MULTIVARIABLE ANALYSIS AMONG BATTLE INJURED PERSONNEL ONLY, MODERATE AND SERIOUS SEVERE INJURY (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.12 2.00 AND OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.01 2.68, RESPECTIVELY), PREVIOUS MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS WITHIN 1 YEAR OF DEPLOYMENT (OR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.50 4.81), AND PREVIOUS BI (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.22 3.16) PREDICTED A POSITIVE PTSD SCREEN. CONCLUSIONS: MILITARY PERSONNEL WITH BI HAVE INCREASED ODDS OF POSITIVE PTSD SCREEN FOLLOWING COMBAT DEPLOYMENT COMPARED TO THOSE WITH NBI.

METHODS: COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED TO INCLUDE ALL THE PROSPECTIVE AND RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES ON BLUNT TRAUMA PATIENTS WITH ALTERED SENSORIUM UNDERGOING CERVICAL SPINE MULTIDETECTOR CT SCAN AS CORE IMAGING MODALITY TO CLEAR THE CERVICAL SPINE. THE STUDIES USED TWO MAIN GOLD STANDARDS, MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING OF THE CERVICAL SPINE AND/OR PROLONGED CLINICAL FOLLOW UP. THE DATA WAS EXTRACTED TO REPORT TRUE POSITIVE, TRUE NEGATIVES, FALSE POSITIVES AND FALSE NEGATIVES. META ANALYSIS OF SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY, NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUES WAS PERFORMED USING META ANALYST BETA 3.13 SOFTWARE. WE ALSO PERFORMED A RETROSPECTIVE INVESTIGATION COMPARING A ROBUST CLINICAL FOLLOW UP AND/OR CERVICAL SPINE MR FINDINGS IN 53 OBTUNDED BLUNT TRAUMA PATIENTS, WHO PREVIOUSLY HAD UNDERGONE A NORMAL MULTIDETECTOR CT SCAN OF THE CERVICAL SPINE REPORTED BY A RADIOLOGIST. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 10 STUDIES INVOLVING 1850 OBTUNDED BLUNT TRAUMA PATIENTS WITH INITIAL CERVICAL SPINE CT SCAN REPORTED AS NORMAL WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL META ANALYSIS. THE CUMULATIVE NEGATIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE AND SPECIFICITY OF CERVICAL SPINE CT OF THE TEN STUDIES WAS 99.7% (99.4 99.9%, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL). THE POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE AND SENSITIVITY WAS 93.7% (84.0 97.7%, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL). IN THE RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF OUR OBTUNDED BLUNT TRAUMA PATIENTS, NONE WAS LATER DIAGNOSED TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CERVICAL SPINE INJURY THAT REQUIRED A CHANGE IN CLINICAL MANAGEMENT. CONCLUSION: IN A BLUNT TRAUMA PATIENT WITH ALTERED SENSORIUM, A NORMAL CERVICAL SPINE CT SCAN IS CONCLUSIVE TO SAFELY RULE OUT A CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT CERVICAL SPINE INJURY. THE RESULTS OF THIS META ANALYSIS STRONGLY SUPPORT THE REMOVAL OF CERVICAL PRECAUTIONS IN OBTUNDED BLUNT TRAUMA PATIENT AFTER NORMAL CERVICAL SPINE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY.

THIS INDICATION IS OFF LABEL, BECAUSE IT IS NOT LICENSED BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. RECENTLY ESAS WERE SUSPECTED TO HARM CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS. OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO ASSESS THE SAFETY OF ESAS IN OFF LABEL INDICATIONS IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS. ELEVEN DATABASES WERE SEARCHED UP TO APRIL 2012. WE CONSIDERED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND CONTROLLED OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES IN ANY LANGUAGE THAT COMPARED OFF LABEL ESAS TREATMENT WITH OTHER EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS, PLACEBO OR NO TREATMENT IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS. TWO AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY SCREENED AND EVALUATED RETRIEVED RECORDS, EXTRACTED DATA AND ASSESSED RISK OF BIAS AND QUALITY OF REPORTING. WE USED FREQUENTIST AND BAYESIAN MODELS TO COMBINE STUDIES, AND PERFORMED SENSITIVITY AND SUBGROUP ANALYSES. FROM 12,888 CITATIONS, WE INCLUDED 48 STUDIES (34 RCTS; 14 OBSERVATIONAL), INVOLVING 944,856 PARTICIPANTS. HARM REPORTING WAS OF MEDIUM TO LOW QUALITY. THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASED RISK OF ADVERSE EVENTS IN GENERAL, SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS, THE MOST FREQUENTLY REPORTED ADVERSE EVENTS, AND DEATH IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS TREATED WITH ESAS. THESE RESULTS WERE ROBUST AGAINST RISK OF BIAS AND ANALYSIS METHODS. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT ESAS INCREASE THE RISK OF CLINICALLY RELEVANT THROMBOTIC VASCULAR EVENTS, AND THERE IS SOME LESS CERTAIN EVIDENCE THAT ESAS MIGHT INCREASE THE RISK FOR VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM. IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS, ADMINISTRATION OF ESAS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CLINICALLY RELEVANT THROMBOTIC VASCULAR EVENTS BUT NOT WITH OTHER FREQUENTLY REPORTED ADVERSE EVENTS AND DEATH.	***

WE EXTRACTED DATA FROM CONSECUTIVE ADMISSIONS OF CHILDREN (1996 2011) TO AICUS FROM THE INTENSIVE CARE NATIONAL AUDIT AND RESEARCH CENTRE CASE MIX PROGRAMME DATABASE. WE STUDIED CASE MIX, OUTCOME AND RESOURCE USE AS WELL AS REGIONAL, SEASONAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATIONS IN ADMISSIONS OF CHILDREN TO AICU. A TOTAL OF 13,430 CHILDREN WERE ADMITTED TO AICUS BETWEEN 1996 AND 2011 (REPRESENTING 1.3 % OF ALL ADMISSIONS). THIS PROPORTION DECREASED FROM 2.8 % IN 1996 TO 0.6 % IN 2011. CRUDE MORTALITY FELL FROM 6.7 TO 2.8 %, AND THE PROPORTION TRANSFERRED OUT TO A PICU ROSE FROM 18.9 TO 51.4 %. IN RECENT YEARS (2009 2011), HALF OF THE 2,320 ADMISSIONS OF CHILDREN OCCURRED IN JUST THREE ENGLISH STRATEGIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES. THE MEDIAN LENGTH OF UNIT STAY WAS 7.7 H (IQR 3.8 19.7) FOR SURVIVORS AND 11.5 H (IQR 5.0 36.2) FOR NON SURVIVORS. THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN ADMITTED TO AICUS IN ENGLAND, WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND HAS BEEN STEADILY DECLINING SINCE 1996. IN RECENT YEARS, HALF OF ALL CHILDREN ADMITTED TO AICUS ARE TRANSFERRED TO PICU, USUALLY FOLLOWING A SHORT STAY. THE REASONS FOR REGIONAL VARIATION IN PAEDIATRIC ADMISSIONS TO AICUS, AND THE CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE SMALL NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO DIE IN AICUS, ARE UNCLEAR.	***

METHOD: PUBMED/MEDLINE AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR DATABASES WERE ELECTRONICALLY SEARCHED TO FIND THE PUBLISHED TRIALS ON ATOMOXETINE AND ASD. RESULTS: SIX ARTICLES REPORTED THE CLINICAL TRIALS OF ATOMOXETINE FOR TREATMENT OF ADHD SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WITH AUTISM OR PERVASIVE DEVELOPMENT DISORDERS. ONLY ONE STUDY THAT WAS PLACEBO CONTROLLED CROSSOVER PILOT TRIAL REPORTED THAT IT IS EFFECTIVE. ATOMOXETINE MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN HIGH FUNCTIONING PATIENTS WITH AUTISM OR PATIENTS WITH LOW SEVERITY. THOSE WITH HIGH SEVERITY OF ASD MAY BE MORE VULNERABLE TO THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF ATOMOXETINE. CONCLUSION: THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS FOR SHOWING THE EFFICACY OF ATOMOXETINE FOR TREATMENT OF ADHD SYMPTOMS IN AUTISM.

OUR APPROACH IS BASED ON THE IDEA OF DIFFERENCE EXPANSION AND UTILIZES GENETIC ALGORITHM (GA) TO IMPROVE WATERMARK CAPACITY AND REDUCE DISTORTION. THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS REVERSIBLE AND THEREFORE, DISTORTION INTRODUCED AFTER WATERMARK INSERTION CAN BE FULLY RESTORED. USING GA, DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES ARE EXPLORED TO MEET THE OPTIMAL CRITERIA RATHER THAN SELECTING LESS EFFECTIVE ATTRIBUTES FOR WATERMARK INSERTION. CHECKING ONLY THE DISTORTION TOLERANCE OF TWO ATTRIBUTES FOR A SELECTED TUPLE MAY NOT BE USEFUL FOR WATERMARK CAPACITY AND DISTORTION THEREFORE, DISTORTION TOLERANCE OF DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES ARE EXPLORED. DISTORTION CAUSED BY DIFFERENCE EXPANSION CAN HELP AN ATTACKER TO PREDICT WATERMARKED ATTRIBUTE. THUS, WE HAVE INCORPORATED TUPLE AND ATTRIBUTE WISE DISTORTION IN THE FITNESS FUNCTION OF GA, MAKING IT TOUGH FOR AN ATTACKER TO PREDICT WATERMARKED ATTRIBUTE. FROM EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE PROVIDES IMPROVED CAPACITY AND REDUCED DISTORTION COMPARED TO EXISTING APPROACHES. PROBLEM OF FALSE POSITIVES AND CHANGE IN ATTRIBUTE ORDER AT DETECTION SIDE IS ALSO RESOLVED. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE IS RESILIENT AGAINST A WIDE RANGE OF ATTACKS SUCH AS ADDITION, DELETION, SORTING, BIT FLIPPING, TUPLE WISE MULTIFACETED, ATTRIBUTE WISE MULTIFACETED, AND ADDITIVE ATTACKS.

WITH ITS ROOTS IN INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURING AND, LATER, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, IT WOULD SEEM NATURAL THAT LPD WOULD ADAPT WELL TO LARGE SCALE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS OF INCREASINGLY SOFTWARE INTENSIVE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CLEAR WHAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED ON THE ACTUAL USE OF LEAN PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT FOR SUCH LARGE SCALE INDUSTRIAL CONTEXTS. THIS WAS THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS STUDY AS THE CONTEXT WAS AN ONGOING INDUSTRY PROCESS IMPROVEMENT PROJECT AT VOLVO CAR CORPORATION AND VOLVO TRUCK CORPORATION. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY ARE TO IDENTIFY AND CLASSIFY STATE OF THE ART IN LARGE SCALE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT INFLUENCED BY LPD APPROACHES AND USE THIS ESTABLISHED KNOWLEDGE TO SUPPORT INDUSTRIAL PARTNERS IN DECISIONS ON A SOFTWARE PROCESS IMPROVEMENT (SPI) PROJECT, AND TO REVEAL RESEARCH GAPS AND PROPOSED EXTENSIONS TO LPD IN RELATION TO ITS WELL KNOWN PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES. FOR LOCATING RELEVANT STATE OF THE ART WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC MAPPING STUDY, AND THE INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY AND RELEVANCE OF RESULTS AND SAID EXTENSIONS TO LPD WERE FURTHER ANALYZED IN THE CONTEXT OF AN ACTUAL, INDUSTRIAL CASE. A TOTAL OF 10,230 PAPERS WERE FOUND IN DATABASE SEARCHES, OF WHICH 38 PAPERS WERE FOUND RELEVANT. OF THESE, ONLY 42 PERCENT CLEARLY ADDRESSED LARGE SCALE DEVELOPMENT. FURTHERMORE, A MAJORITY OF PAPERS (76 PERCENT) WERE NON EMPIRICAL AND MANY LACKED INFORMATION ABOUT STUDY DESIGN, CONTEXT AND/OR LIMITATIONS. MOST OF THE IDENTIFIED RESULTS FOCUSED ON ELIMINATING WASTE AND CREATING FLOW IN THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, BUT THERE WAS A LACK OF RESULTS FOR OTHER LPD PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES. OVERALL, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT RESEARCH IN THE MUCH HYPED FIELD OF LEAN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IS IN ITS NASCENT STATE WHEN IT COMES TO LARGE SCALE DEVELOPMENT. THERE IS VERY LITTLE SUPPORT AVAILABLE FOR PRACTITIONERS WHO WANT TO APPLY LEAN APPROACHES FOR IMPROVING LARGE SCALE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO INTER DEPARTMENTAL INTERACTIONS DURING DEVELOPMENT.

ALL PEPTIDE CARBOXYL GROUPS ASPARTIC AND GLUTAMIC ACID SIDE CHAINS AS WELL AS C TERMINI WERE DERIVATIZED WITH AN AVERAGE REACTION EFFICIENCY OF 99 %. THIS NEARLY COMPLETE LABELING AVOIDS MAKING COMPLEX PEPTIDE MIXTURES EVEN MORE COMPLEX BECAUSE OF PARTIALLY LABELED PRODUCTS, AND IT ALLOWS THE USE OF STATIC MODIFICATIONS DURING DATABASE SEARCHING. ALKYL TERTIARY AMINES WERE FOUND TO BE THE OPTIMAL LABELING REAGENT AMONG THE FOUR TYPES TESTED. CHARGE STATES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER FOR DERIVATIZED PEPTIDES: A MODIFIED TRYPTIC DIGEST OF BOVINE SERUM ALBUMIN (BSA) GENERATES SIMILAR TO 90% OF ITS PRECURSOR IONS WITH Z > 2, COMPARED WITH LESS THAN 40 % FOR THE UNMODIFIED SAMPLE. THE INCREASED CHARGE DENSITY OF MODIFIED PEPTIDE IONS YIELDS HIGHLY EFFICIENT ETD FRAGMENTATION, LEADING TO MANY ADDITIONAL PEPTIDE IDENTIFICATIONS AND HIGHER SEQUENCE COVERAGE (E.G., 70 % FOR MODIFIED VERSUS ONLY 43 % FOR UNMODIFIED BSA). THE UTILITY OF THIS LABELING STRATEGY WAS DEMONSTRATED ON A TRYPTIC DIGEST OF RIBOSOMAL PROTEINS ISOLATED FROM YEAST CELLS. PEPTIDE DERIVATIZATION OF THIS SAMPLE PRODUCED AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF IDENTIFIED PROTEINS, A > 50 % INCREASE IN THE SEQUENCE COVERAGE OF THESE PROTEINS, AND A DOUBLING OF THE NUMBER OF PEPTIDE SPECTRAL MATCHES. THIS CARBOXYL DERIVATIZATION STRATEGY GREATLY IMPROVES PROTEOME COVERAGE OBTAINED FROM ETD MS/MS OF TRYPTIC DIGESTS, AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL ALSO ENHANCE IDENTIFICATION AND LOCALIZATION OF POST TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS.	***

WE INVESTIGATED THESE PATTERNS AT A REGIONAL SCALE USING THE TENEBRIONID BEETLES OF LATIUM (CENTRAL ITALY). FOR THIS, WE CALCULATED GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE SIZE (NO. OF 10 KM SQUARE CELLS), ECOLOGICAL TOLERANCE (NO. OF PHYTOCLIMATIC UNITS) AND ABUNDANCE (NO. OF SAMPLED INDIVIDUALS) USING A LARGE DATABASE CONTAINING 3561 GEOREFERENCED RECORDS FOR 84 NATIVE SPECIES. FOR EACH SPECIES, WE ALSO CALCULATED BODY MASS AND ITS PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY ON THE BASIS OF CLADISTIC RELATIONSHIPS. FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF RANGE SIZE FOLLOWED A LOG NORMAL DISTRIBUTION AS FOUND IN MANY OTHER ANIMAL GROUPS. HOWEVER, A LOG NORMAL DISTRIBUTION ACCOMMODATED WELL THE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF ECOLOGICAL TOLERANCE, A SO FAR UNEXPLORED ISSUE. RANGE SIZE WAS CORRELATED WITH ABUNDANCE AND ECOLOGICAL TOLERANCE, THUS SUPPORTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE IS A REFLECTION OF INTERSPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN ECOLOGICAL SPECIALIZATION. LARGER SPECIES TENDED TO HAVE LARGER RANGES AND BROADER ECOLOGICAL TOLERANCE. HOWEVER, CONTRARY TO WHAT KNOWN IN MOST VERTEBRATES, NOT ONLY SMALL SIZED, BUT ALSO MANY MEDIUM TO LARGE SIZED SPECIES EXHIBITED GREAT VARIABILITY IN THEIR RANGE SIZE, PROBABLY BECAUSE TENEBRIONIDS ARE NOT SO STRICTLY INFLUENCED BY BODY SIZE CONSTRAINTS (E.G. HOME RANGES) AS VERTEBRATES. MOREOVER, IN CONTRAST TO OTHER ANIMALS, TENEBRIONID BODY SIZE DOES NOT INFLUENCE SPECIES ABUNDANCES, PROBABLY BECAUSE THESE DETRITIVOROUS ANIMALS ARE NOT STRONGLY REGULATED BY COMPETITION. FINALLY, CONTRARY TO THE ASSUMPTION THAT RARE SPECIES SHOULD BE MAINLY FOUND AMONG LINEAGES THAT SPLIT FROM BASAL NODES, RARITY OF A TENEBRIONID SPECIES WAS NOT INFLUENCED BY THE PHYLOGENETIC POSITION OF ITS TRIBE. HOWEVER, LINEAGES THAT SPLIT FROM MORE BASAL NODES HAD LOWER VARIABILITY IN TERMS OF SPECIES GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION, ECOLOGICAL TOLERANCE AND ABUNDANCE, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT LINEAGES THAT SPLIT FROM MORE BASAL NODES ARE NOT ONLY MORPHOLOGICALLY CONSERVATIVE BUT ALSO TEND TO HAVE AN ECOLOGICAL INERTIA.	***

ALIGNMENT AND SCORING ENGINE (PHASE) SOFTWARE HAS BEEN USED TO DEVELOP LIGAND BASED PHARMACOPHORE MODEL USING A LARGE SET OF 36 DIFFERENT AROMATIC/HETEROCYCLIC SULFAMATES CARBONIC ANHYDRASE INHIBITORS, SUCH AS CA IX CHOSEN FOR THE PRESENT STUDY. IN THIS STUDY PHARMACOPHORE MODEL WAS DEVELOPED BY DOWNLOADING A LARGE SET OF 36 LIGANDS WITH KI (NM) VALUE FROM BINDING DATABASE. KI RANGED FROM >24 WERE CONSIDERED AS INACTIVE AND <24 NM WERE CONSIDERED AS ACTIVE AND FOUND LIGAND 3BA AS A TEMPLET MOLECULE FOR THE DATASET CHOSEN BY PHASE. PHASE MODULE OF SCHRODINGER REVEALED THE TWO HYDROGEN BOND ACCEPTORS, TWO HYDROGEN BOND DONORS, AND ONE HYDROPHOBIC AROMATIC RING (AADDR.47) AS CRUCIAL MOLECULAR FEATURES THAT PREDICT BINDING AFFINITY OF LIGANDS TO THE HCA IX ISOENZYME INHIBITION. THE VALIDITY OF EACH MODEL PREDICTED FROM THE CALCULATED CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (Q(2)) OF 0.7049 AND PREDICTED SQUARED CORRELATION COEFFICIENT Q(2) (R(2) (PRED)) OF 0.6280 FOR THE TEST SET CONFIRMS THE GOOD PREDICTABILITY OF THE QSAR MODEL. THE VARIANT WITH A SITE SCORE 0.89, VECTOR SCORE 0.952, VOLUME SCORE 0.654, AND SURVIVAL SCORE OF 3.497 WAS CONSIDERED TO BE THE BEST PHARMACOPHORE HYPOTHESIS. THE INFORMATION RENDERED BY PHARMACOPHORE AND 3D QSAR MODELING CAN PROVIDE GUIDELINES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMPROVED HCA IX INHIBITORS AS LEADS FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF METASTATIC CANCERS INCLUDING THOSE OF CERVICAL, RENAL, BREAST AND HEAD AND NECK ORIGIN.	***

RECENT STUDIES INDICATE THAT INDENOISOQUINOLINES CAN PROVIDE GREATER STABILITY TO DRUG TOPOISOMERASE DNA CLEAVAGE COMPLEXES, WHICH MAKES THEM A MORE APPROPRIATE ANTICANCER CLASS OF COMPOUNDS COMPARED TO CAMPTOTHECIN. IN VIEW OF SUCH SIGNIFICANCE, A THREE DIMENSIONAL PHARMACOPHORE MODEL HAS BEEN DEVELOPED USING A TRAINING SET OF 36 INDENOISOQUINOLINE BASED TOPOISOMERASE INHIBITORS. THE VALIDATED BEST MODEL CONSISTS OF THREE CHEMICAL FEATURES: ONE HYDROPHOBIC, ONE POSITIVE IONIZABLE, AND ONE RING AROMATIC WITH GOOD CORRELATION VALUES OF R ((TRAINING)) (2) 0.827 AND R ((TEST)) (2) 0.702. FURTHERMORE, 98 % VALIDATION BY CATSCRAMBLE METHOD AND A GOOD R (2) OF 0.703 FROM 22 EXTERNAL TEST SET COMPOUNDS HAVE TESTIFIED THE UNIVERSAL APPLICABILITY OF THE GENERATED MODEL. VALIDATED THREE FEATURE PHARMACOPHORE MODEL HAS BEEN USED TO SCREEN THE CHEMICAL DATABASE FROM THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (NCI) LEADING TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF 17 DRUGGABLE TOP I INHIBITORS WHICH CAN BE RAISED INTO DRUG CANDIDATES AFTER FURTHER EVALUATION.	***

WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. A SEARCH OF THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, CINAHL, EMBASE AND MEDLINE DATABASES WAS UNDERTAKEN FOR PAPERS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH AND ITALIAN FROM JANUARY 2002 TO MAY 2012. ELEVEN STUDIES SATISFIED THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, WERE SUBJECTED TO QUALITY ASSESSMENT AND INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW. WE ANALYSED THE DATA USING THEMATIC ANALYSIS. THE FACTORS INFLUENCING WOMEN WERE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER EXTERNAL OR PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS. EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDED THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SCREENING, SCREENING RESULTS AND USE OF GENETIC COUNSELLING. PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS RELATED TO ETHNICITY, SOCIO DEMOGRAPHIC STATUS AND ATTENDANCE OF PARTNERS DURING COUNSELLING.

MANY STUDIES IN DEVELOPED AND VERY FEW IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO UNDERSTAND THIS PHENOMENON. THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY EXPLORES EXPERIENCES OF WOMEN HAVING CAESAREAN SECTION ON DEMAND IN A MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRY WITH A PRIVATE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. DESIGN: AN INDUCTIVE QUALITATIVE DESIGN, USING FACE TO FACE SEMI STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS. SETTING: WOMEN WERE IDENTIFIED AND RECRUITED THROUGH A PERINATAL DATABASE AND SELECTED OBSTETRICIANS CLINICS IN THE GREATER BEIRUT AREA IN LEBANON. PARTICIPANTS: A PURPOSIVE SAMPLE OF WOMEN WHO HAD A CAESAREAN CHILDBIRTH WITHIN THE FOUR MONTHS PRECEDING THE INTERVIEW, WERE VISITED FOR AN INTERVIEW AT HOME USING A SEMI STRUCTURED INTERVIEW GUIDE. THEMATIC CONTENT ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED ON A SUB SAMPLE OF 22 WOMEN WHO REQUESTED A CAESAREAN BIRTH. FINDINGS: LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT CAESAREAN SECTIONS FOSTERS WOMENS FEAR FROM LABOUR PAIN AND ACTS AS THE MAIN IMPETUS FOR WOMEN TO CONSIDER CAESAREANS AS THE PAIN FREE ALTERNATIVE. FINDINGS REVEAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ROLE IN REINFORCING BELIEFS ABOUT CAESAREAN SECTIONS BEING THE WAY FOR PAIN FREE DELIVERIES BY OVERESTIMATING THE SAFETY OF THE PROCEDURE AND DISREGARDING POSTPARTUM HEALTH ISSUES. KEY CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: CAESAREAN BIRTH IS PRESENTED TO WOMEN AS A SAFE OPTION FOR PAIN FREE CHILDBIRTH. THIS NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED WITHIN THE CULTURAL CONTEXT OF UNDERSTANDING SAFETY AND PAIN AS WELL AS THE DYNAMICS OF POWER IN MATERNITY CARE. HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS NEED TO EXPLORE THESE DIMENSIONS AND PROMOTE WOMENS INFORMED CHOICE AS WELL AS ENCOURAGING THE NORMALITY OF BIRTH. (C) 2012 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

SURVEYS OF THREE DATABASES (BDENF, CINAHL AND MEDLINE) WERE CONDUCTED BETWEEN 2002 AND 2012. THE INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE: (1) FULL TEXT ARTICLE AVAILABLE; (2) PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2002 AND 2012; (3) WRITTEN BY BRAZILIAN NURSE MIDWIVES, AND (4) FITTING THE DESCRIPTORS: CHILDBIRTH PAIN; NON INVASIVE TECHNOLOGIES; LABOUR; AND PAIN RELIEF. FOR PURPOSES OF ANALYSIS, THE TECHNOLOGIES MENTIONED WERE CLASSIFIED INTO FOUR MAIN CATEGORIES OF SUPPORT AS THEY RELATE TO ENVIRONMENT, POSITION, TACTILE STIMULATION, AND ENERGY LEVEL. FINDINGS: WE LOCATED 21 SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES THAT MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA AND ADDRESSED THE NON INVASIVE TECHNOLOGIES THAT NURSE MIDWIVES USE TO PROVIDE PAIN RELIEF DURING LABOUR. THE TECHNOLOGIES MOST USED WAS: STIMULATION OF BREATHING AND RELAXATION; USE OF MASSAGE WITH ESSENTIAL OILS; ENCOURAGING FREEDOM TO MOVE, TO WALK AND THE FREE CHOICE FOR VERTICAL POSITIONING; USE OF SHOWERS AND BATHS; USE OF BIRTH BULL. CONCLUSION: BRAZILIAN NURSE MIDWIVES HAVE MADE EFFORTS TO FOCUS CARE DURING DELIVERY ON THE PARTURIENT. BY STUDYING AND PUBLISHING ABOUT THE NON INVASIVE CARE TECHNOLOGIES THEY HAVE STRENGTHENED DE MEDICALISED KNOWLEDGE, BASED ON SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND GOOD OUTCOMES IN PAIN RELIEF DURING LABOUR.

MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION WITH ADJUSTMENT FOR CONFOUNDING VARIABLES WAS UTILIZED TO IDENTIFY RISK FACTORS FOR MORTALITY AT 30 DAYS, MAJOR ADVERSE EVENTS, AND PROLONGED LENGTH OF STAY (PLOS). WE IDENTIFIED 32,946 PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT RYGB; OF THESE, 1,731 (5.2 %) UNDERWENT RYGB + C. OVERALL, RYGB + C WAS A RISK FACTOR FOR PREDICTING MAJOR ADVERSE EVENTS FOLLOWING LAPAROSCOPIC BUT NOT OPEN PROCEDURES. REGARDLESS OF APPROACH, PLOS WAS MORE COMMON AMONG RYGB + C PATIENTS FOLLOWING ADJUSTMENT. OVERALL MORTALITY AT 30 DAYS WAS LOW AND DID NOT VARY WITH CONCOMITANT CHOLECYSTECTOMY FOLLOWING ADJUSTMENT. THE RISK FOR MAJOR ADVERSE EVENTS IS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER FOR RYGB + C PATIENTS FOLLOWING LAPAROSCOPIC PROCEDURES, AND THE RISK FOR PLOS IS GREATER FOR RYGB + C PATIENTS FOLLOWING BOTH OPEN AND LAPAROSCOPIC PROCEDURES. THE SHORT TERM RISKS IDENTIFIED IN THIS STUDY CAN ASSIST IN DECISION MAKING WHEN CONSIDERING CONCOMITANT CHOLECYSTECTOMY AT THE TIME OF RYGB.	***

PARTICIPATION IN THE QUALITY ASSURANCE STUDY IS VOLUNTARY. SINCE 2005, 3,453 GASTRIC BANDING PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN PERFORMED AT 88 HOSPITALS. THE MEAN AGE OF PATIENTS WAS 40.7 YEARS, AND THE MEAN BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) WAS 45.2 KG/M(2). BMI AND COMORBIDITIES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN MALE PATIENTS. REGARDING GENDER SPECIFIC ASPECTS, THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE PERIOPERATIVE COMPLICATION RATES. THE AMELIORATION RATE OF COMORBIDITIES IN MALE PATIENTS IS LOWER THAN IN FEMALE PATIENTS. GASTRIC BANDING IN GERMANY IS GENERALLY PERFORMED IN PATIENTS WITH A BMI BELOW 45 KG/M(2). THE PERIOPERATIVE COMPLICATION RATE IS LOW. DATA FROM THE NATIONWIDE SURVEY OF THE GERMAN BARIATRIC SURGERY REGISTRY SHOW SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN PREOPERATIVE COMORBIDITIES AND THEIR AMELIORATION BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE PATIENTS. THERE IS A NEED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION OF GENDER SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF GASTRIC BANDING PROCEDURES TO OPTIMIZE PATIENT SELECTION, REDUCE SPECIFIC POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS, AND ACHIEVE LONG TERM EFFECTS ON WEIGHT LOSS AND REMISSION OF COMORBIDITIES.	***

HOWEVER, THE IMPACT OF SDB ON POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING BARIATRIC SURGERY REMAINS LESS CLEARLY DEFINED. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT SDB WOULD BE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH WORSE POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES. DATA WERE OBTAINED FROM THE NATIONWIDE INPATIENT SAMPLE DATABASE AND INCLUDED A TOTAL OF 91,028 ADULT PATIENTS UNDERGOING BARIATRIC SURGERIES FROM 2004 TO 2008. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE IN HOSPITAL DEATH, TOTAL CHARGES, AND LENGTH OF STAY. THERE WERE TWO SECONDARY OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: RESPIRATORY AND CARDIAC COMPLICATIONS. REGRESSION MODELS WERE FITTED TO ASSESS THE INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SDB AND THE OUTCOMES OF INTEREST. SDB WAS INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED MORTALITY (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.23 0.50, P < 0.001), TOTAL CHARGES ( $869, P < 0.001), AND LENGTH OF STAY ( 0.25 DAYS, P < 0.001).

EMERGENT INTUBATION OCCURRED SIGNIFICANTLY EARLIER IN THE POSTOPERATIVE COURSE IN PATIENTS WITH SDB. ALTHOUGH NON SDB PATIENTS HAD AN OVERALL LOWER RISK OF EMERGENT INTUBATION COMPARED TO SDB PATIENTS, THEIR OUTCOMES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE WHEN THEY DID GET EMERGENTLY INTUBATED. IN THIS LARGE NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE, DESPITE THE INCREASED ASSOCIATION OF SDB/OSA WITH POSTOPERATIVE CARDIOPULMONARY COMPLICATIONS, THE DIAGNOSIS OF SDB/OSA WAS NEGATIVELY, RATHER THAN POSITIVELY, ASSOCIATED WITH IN HOSPITAL MORTALITY AND RESOURCE USE.	***

BARIATRIC SURGERY REMAINS THE MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH SEVERE OBESITY, RESULTING IN IMPROVED OBESITY RELATED CO MORBIDITIES AND INCREASED OVERALL LIFE EXPECTANCY. HOWEVER, WEIGHT RECIDIVISM HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN A SUBSET OF PATIENTS POST BARIATRIC SURGERY. WEIGHT RECIDIVISM HAS SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL, SOCIETAL AND ECONOMIC RAMIFICATIONS. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS A VERY LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO PREDICT WHICH BARIATRIC SURGICAL PATIENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO REGAIN WEIGHT FOLLOWING SURGERY AND HOW TO APPROPRIATELY TREAT PATIENTS WHO HAVE REGAINED WEIGHT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW THE EXISTING LITERATURE TO ASSESS THE INCIDENCE AND CAUSATIVE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH WEIGHT REGAIN FOLLOWING BARIATRIC SURGERY. AN ELECTRONIC LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED OF THE MEDLINE, EMBASE AND COCHRANE LIBRARY DATABASES ALONG WITH THE PUBMED US NATIONAL LIBRARY FROM JANUARY 1950 TO DECEMBER 2012 TO IDENTIFY RELEVANT ARTICLES. FOLLOWING AN INITIAL SCREEN OF 2,204 TITLES, 1,437 ABSTRACTS WERE REVIEWED AND 1,421 MET EXCLUSION CRITERIA. SIXTEEN STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THIS ANALYSIS: SEVEN CASE SERIES, FIVE SURVEYS AND FOUR NON RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, WITH A TOTAL OF 4,864 PATIENTS FOR ANALYSIS. WEIGHT REGAIN IN THESE PATIENTS APPEARED TO BE MULTI FACTORIAL AND OVERLAPPING. AETIOLOGIES WERE CATEGORIZED AS PATIENT SPECIFIC (PSYCHIATRIC, PHYSICAL INACTIVITY, ENDOCRINOPATHIES/METABOLIC AND DIETARY NON COMPLIANCE) AND OPERATION SPECIFIC. WEIGHT REGAIN FOLLOWING BARIATRIC SURGERY VARIES ACCORDING TO DURATION OF FOLLOW UP AND THE BARIATRIC SURGICAL PROCEDURE PERFORMED. THE UNDERLYING CAUSES LEADING TO WEIGHT REGAIN ARE MULTI FACTORIAL AND RELATED TO PATIENT AND PROCEDURE SPECIFIC FACTORS. ADDRESSING POST SURGICAL WEIGHT REGAIN REQUIRES A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO PATIENT ASSESSMENT FOCUSING ON CONTRIBUTORY DIETARY, PSYCHOLOGIC, MEDICAL AND SURGICAL FACTORS.	***

MUCOSA ASSOCIATED LYMPHOID TISSUE (MALT) LYMPHOMA OF THE LUNG HAS NEVER BEEN REPORTED AS A CAUSATIVE OR PRECIPITATING FACTOR FOR CAPS IN THE CAPS REGISTRY DATABASE. THE PRESENT STUDY DESCRIBES A RARE CASE OF PULMONARY MALT LYMPHOMA OF THE LUNG THAT PRESENTED AS CAPS. A 19 YEAR OLD HISPANIC FEMALE PRESENTED WITH SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND ABDOMINAL PAIN. COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCANS OF THE CHEST AND ABDOMEN REVEALED MULTIPLE PORTAL VEIN THROMBOSES AND BILATERAL PULMONARY NODULES. WITHIN ONE WEEK OF PRESENTATION, THE PATIENT DEVELOPED A STRAIGHT SINUS THROMBOSIS AND UPPER EXTREMITY DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS, WHICH LED TO SHORTNESS OF BREATH. A BIOPSY OF THE LUNG NODULE REVEALED MALT LYMPHOMA. THE PRESENT CASE ILLUSTRATES A RARELY REPORTED PULMONARY MALT LYMPHOMA PRESENTING AS CAPS IN A YOUNG FEMALE. THE PATIENT WAS SUCCESSFULLY TREATED WITH 90 MG/M(2) BENDAMUSTINE ON DAYS ONE AND TWO AND RITUXIMAB 375 MG/M(2) ON DAY ONE OF EACH 28 DAY CYCLE. COMPLETE REMISSION OF THE LUNG NODULES WAS OBSERVED FOLLOWING THREE CYCLES OF TREATMENT, AS VISUALIZED BY POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET)/CT SCAN. FONDAPARINUX WAS IDENTIFIED AS A FEASIBLE ANTICOAGULATION DRUG OF CHOICE FOR THIS CASE. AT SEVEN MONTHS POST TREATMENT, THE PATIENT CONTINUES TO BE STABLE WITH NO FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THROMBOSIS AND IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING RITUXIMAB MAINTENANCE THERAPY EVERY SIX MONTHS FOR TWO YEARS. A REPEAT LUPUS ANTICOAGULANT ANTIBODY ASSAY TURNED AND REMAINED NEGATIVE DURING THE CLINICAL FOLLOW UP PERIOD. A PROMPT DIAGNOSIS AND EARLY AGGRESSIVE TREATMENT IS POTENTIALLY CURATIVE AND MAY DRAMATICALLY DECREASE THE MORTALITY RISK. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD EXPLORE THE ROLE OF RITUXIMAB IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CAPS ASSOCIATED B CELL LYMPHOID MALIGNANCIES.	***

A RECENT META ANALYSIS OF SEVEN CLINICAL STUDIES EXAMINED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEARNING OR BEHAVIOR DIFFICULTIES AND PEDIATRIC EXPOSURE TO ANESTHESIA/SURGERY AND REPORTED AN ODDS RATIO OF 1.4; HOWEVER, THE LEVEL OF ASSOCIATION AND CAUSAL FACTORS REMAIN UNCLEAR. THE PURPOSE OF OUR STUDY IS TO PROVIDE CONTEXT TO THE PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIA NEUROTOXICITY QUESTION BY REVIEWING THE EVIDENCE LINKING FOUR CHILDHOOD ILLNESSES WITH NEUROCOGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT. IN THE PRESENT REVIEW, WE HAVE SOUGHT TO QUANTIFY THE MAGNITUDE OF THE IMPACT OF CHRONIC ILLNESS ON NEUROCOGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF PUBLICATIONS THAT REPORT THE DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORY OF PATIENTS WITH FOUR CHILDHOOD DISEASES: CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF), HEMOPHILIA A, END STAGE RENAL DISEASE (ESRD) AND END STAGE LIVER DISEASE (ESLD). METHODSSTUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED BY SEARCHING THE ELECTRONIC DATABASES OVID MEDLINE AND PUBMED AND SCANNING REFERENCE LISTS OF ARTICLES BY TWO AUTHORS. LIMITS WERE APPLIED TO THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND TO HUMANS. WE USED THE FOLLOWING SEARCH TERMS: CF, HEMOPHILIA A, ESRD, ESLD IN COMBINATION WITH ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE, EDUCATIONAL STATUS, EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT, LEARNING, ACHIEVEMENT, DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY, LEARNING DISABILITIES, INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES, BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS, INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT (IQ), COGNITION, SCHOOL PROBLEMS, ABSENTEEISM, SCHOOL ATTENDANCE, ANXIETY, LEARNING REGRESSION, OR DEVELOPMENTAL REGRESSION. THE SEARCH STRATEGY WAS REVIEWED INDEPENDENTLY BY ALL FOUR AUTHORS. ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT WAS PERFORMED INDEPENDENTLY IN AN UNBLINDED STANDARDIZED MANNER BY TWO AUTHORS WHO CHOSE RELEVANT ARTICLES FROM THE OVERALL SEARCH RESULTS BY SCANNING THE TITLES AND ABSTRACTS OF ARTICLES AND FROM THE REFERENCES WITHIN CITATIONS. THE FULL TEXT PUBLICATIONS WERE REVIEWED BY ALL FOUR AUTHORS. ALL PERTINENT DATA RELATED TO THE OBJECTIVES WERE COLLECTED AND INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED BY TWO AUTHORS. THE DATA WERE SUMMARIZED IN THE FORM REPORTED IN THE STUDIES. WHEN POSSIBLE, REPORTED DATA WERE SUBMITTED TO ANALYSIS WITH THE MANTEL HAENSZEL METHOD USING A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL. ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED USING THE REVIEW MANAGER COMPUTER PROGRAM. RESULTSIN THE STUDIES RETRIEVED, THE MAIN OUTCOMES WERE MEASURES OF INTELLECTUAL OR COGNITIVE CHARACTERISTICS, AS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE WECHSLER BATTERY OF TESTS. REPORTING OF MEASURES OF ACHIEVEMENT (FOR EXAMPLE, GPA) WAS RARE. CHILDREN WITH CF AND HEMOPHILIA A DID NOT APPEAR DISADVANTAGED BY THEIR DISEASE AS GENERAL INTELLIGENCE LEVELS WERE COMPARABLE WITH THE GENERAL POPULATION NORMS. IN CHILDREN WITH ESRD, MEAN IQ REPORTED DURING DIALYSIS IMPROVED AFTER TRANSPLANTATION. ALTHOUGH THEY IMPROVED RELATIVE TO THEIR PRETRANSPLANTATION COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING, CHILDREN WITH ESLD WHO RECEIVED TRANSPLANTS ARE APPROXIMATELY EIGHT IQ POINTS BELOW THE POPULATION NORM. CONCLUSIONSOVERALL, THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE BURDEN OF CHRONIC CHILDHOOD ILLNESS, BY ITSELF, DOES NOT IMPAIR COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT IN CHILDREN WITH HEMOPHILIA A AND CF. CHILDREN WITH ESRD AND ESLD, DESPITE OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT, SHOW A MILD COGNITIVE DEFICIT COMPARED WITH THE POPULATION NORM. GIVEN THE IMPACT OF THESE FOUR SPECIFIC CHRONIC ILLNESSES ON NEUROCOGNITIVE OUTCOME IN CHILDREN AND THE IMPROVEMENT IN IQ POST TRANSPLANT IN BOTH ESRD AND ESLD, THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE EFFECT OF AN UNCONTROLLED CONFOUNDING ILLNESS ON NEUROCOGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT IS SMALL.	***

THIS RESEARCH PRESENTS AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH FOR MODELING TERRORISM ACTIVITY, ONE THAT MONITORS AND DETECTS SPACE TIME CLUSTERS OF TERRORIST INCIDENTS USING PROSPECTIVE SPACE TIME SCAN STATISTICS. SUCH CLUSTERS PROVIDE INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL OUTBREAKS OF TERRORIST INCIDENTS. TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE APPROACH, WE ANALYZE THE TERRORIST INCIDENTS IN THE CONSORTIUM FOR THE STUDY OF TERRORISM AND RESPONSES TO TERRORISMS (START) GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE (GTD) FROM 1998 TO 2004.

METHODSTHE JOHNS HOPKINS RP DATABASE (1982 2011) WAS QUERIED FOR 505 (2.5%) MEN WITH NODE POSITIVE (N1) PC. SURVIVAL ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED USING THE KAPLAN MEIER METHOD AND PROPORTIONAL HAZARD REGRESSION MODELS.

HOWEVER, CURRENT DECISION MAKING PRACTICES DEPEND UPON DETAILED COST ESTIMATING AND SCHEDULING DURING THE DESIGN DEVELOPMENT PHASE AND NOT ROUGH COST ESTIMATING AND SCHEDULING DURING THE SCHEMATIC DESIGN PHASE. DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN A PROJECT BUDGET AND PROGRAM WITH ESTIMATED CONSTRUCTION COST AND CONSTRUCTION PERIOD OFTEN RESULT IN ARCHITECT AND CONSULTANTS HAVING TO PERFORM COSTLY RE DESIGN WORK. TO MITIGATE THESE ISSUES, THIS STUDY PROPOSES A DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM (DSS) MODEL. AN INTERIM DESIGN DEVELOPMENT PHASE IS INTRODUCED BETWEEN THE SCHEMATIC DESIGN PHASE AND THE DESIGN DEVELOPMENT PHASE. DESIGN ALTERNATIVE GENERATION, DATABASE, COST AND SCHEDULE ESTIMATION MODULES ARE DEVELOPED. THE DESIGN ALTERNATIVE GENERATION MODULE PROVIDES DESIGN ALTERNATIVES THAT CHANGE PROPORTIONATELY IN RESPONSE TO INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THE NUMBER OF BUILDING STORIES. THE DATABASE MODULE IS ESTABLISHED FOR COST AND SCHEDULE ESTIMATION MODULES. THE COST AND SCHEDULE ESTIMATION MODULES PRODUCE CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND CONSTRUCTION PERIOD FOR DESIGN ALTERNATIVES. FINALLY, THE PROPOSED DSS IS VALIDATED THROUGH THE CASE STUDY OF AN ONGOING REAL SUPER TALL BUILDING. ULTIMATELY, THE NEW DSS CAN ASSIST PROJECT CONTROL GROUPS IN PERFORMING EFFICIENT AND FINANCIALLY BENEFICIAL DECISION MAKING IN TERMS OF CONSTRUCTION COST AND CONSTRUCTION PERIOD. THIS RESEARCH PROVIDES A FUNDAMENTAL STEP TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DSS FOR SUPER TALL BUILDING PROJECTS. COPYRIGHT (C) 2012 JOHN WILEY & SONS, LTD.	***

THIS STUDY COMPARED DA AND EA WITH RESPECT TO FREQUENCY OF SYNCHRONIZATION AND FREQUENCIES OF TOTAL AND ESA HEALTHCARE VISITS IN CURRENT CLINICAL PRACTICE. A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF ESA UTILIZATION DURING ESA EPISODES OF CARE WAS CONDUCTED ON ALL CANCER PATIENTS IDENTIFIED IN THE SDI HEALTH ONCOLOGY ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS DATABASE WHO UNDERWENT CHEMOTHERAPY AND RECEIVED ESA THERAPY FROM JULY 1, 2007 TO MARCH 31, 2010 (N 6522 DA, N 3,439 EA). THE FREQUENCY OF SYNCHRONIZATION (CHEMOTHERAPY AND ESA THERAPY ON THE SAME DAY) WAS HIGHER WITH DA (67 %) THAN EA (58 %) (P < 0.001). THE ODDS THAT AN ESA ADMINISTRATION WAS SYNCHRONIZED WITH CHEMOTHERAPY WERE HIGHER WITH DA COMPARED WITH EA (ODDS RATIO 1.46, 95 % CI: 1.37, 1.54). COMPARED WITH EA, DA PATIENTS HAD 2.3 FEWER VISITS WITH AN ESA ADMINISTRATION (P < 0.001) AND 3.0 FEWER TOTAL VISITS (P < 0.001). COMPARED WITH PATIENTS RECEIVING EA, DA PATIENTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE AN ESA ADMINISTRATION ON THE SAME HEALTHCARE VISIT AS CHEMOTHERAPY AND HAD FEWER VISITS FOR ANY CAUSE OR FOR ESA ADMINISTRATION. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THROUGH GREATER SYNCHRONIZATION OF ESA AND CHEMOTHERAPY ADMINISTRATIONS, DA MAY REDUCE PATIENT AND PRACTICE BURDEN AND HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION.	***

THE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM CONSORTIUM DATABASE WAS QUERIED TO PERFORM A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY OF WOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT OVARIAN CANCER WHO WERE DIAGNOSED WITH CDI. INPATIENTS UNDERGOING TOTAL HYSTERECTOMY FROM 2008 TO 2012 WERE STUDIED. OVARIAN CANCER PATIENTS WERE COMPARED TO NON OVARIAN CANCER PATIENTS TO EVALUATE RELATIVE RISK (RR) OF CDI. ADJUSTMENT WAS MADE FOR KNOWN OR SUSPECTED CDI RISK FACTORS TO DETERMINE RR OF CDI INDEPENDENT OF THESE VARIABLES. IN THIS STUDY, 115,203 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. CDI WAS REPORTED IN 0.80 % OF OVARIAN CANCER PATIENTS AND IN 0.31 % OF NON OVARIAN CANCER PATIENTS (RR 2.50; 95 % CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) 2.02 TO 3.35). STRATIFICATION BY AGE, PRESENCE OF OTHER COMORBIDITIES, OR ADMINISTRATION OF ANTINEOPLASTIC DRUGS DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFY THE ELEVATED RISK ASSOCIATED WITH OVARIAN CANCER. SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED RISK IN OVARIAN CANCER PATIENTS WAS NO LONGER OBSERVED AFTER CONTROLLING FOR BROAD SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTIC ADMINISTRATION (RR 1.28, 95 % CI 0.39 TO 4.13). COMPARED TO NON OVARIAN CANCER PATIENTS, OVARIAN CANCER PATIENTS WERE MORE FREQUENTLY TREATED WITH BROAD SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS, HAD A 39 % LONGER MEAN DURATION OF THERAPY, AND HAD 2.5 FOLD GREATER MEAN TOTAL EXPOSURE TO BROAD SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS. AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR ANTIBIOTIC USE, OVARIAN CANCER PATIENTS ARE NOT AT EXCESS RISK OF CDI. ADDITIONAL STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THE PATTERNS OF BROAD SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTIC PRESCRIPTION FOR OVARIAN CANCER PATIENTS LEADING TO INCREASED EXPOSURE. IF FEASIBLE, REDUCTION OF THIS EXPOSURE MAY DECREASE MORBIDITY IN THIS POPULATION.	***

HOWEVER, IF SOME OF THE SHAPE DATA ARE MISSING, GPA CANNOT BE APPLIED. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE EM GPA, WHICH EXTENDS GPA TO HANDLE SHAPES WITH HIDDEN (MISSING) VARIABLES BY USING THE EXPECTATION MAXIMIZATION (EM) ALGORITHM. FOR EXAMPLE, 2D SHAPES CAN BE CONSIDERED AS 3D SHAPES WITH MISSING DEPTH INFORMATION DUE TO THE PROJECTION OF 3D SHAPES INTO THE IMAGE PLANE. FOR A SET OF 2D SHAPES, EM GPA FINDS SCALES, ROTATIONS AND 3D SHAPES ALONG WITH THEIR MEAN AND COVARIANCE MATRIX FOR 3D SHAPE MODELING. A DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTIC OF EM GPA IS THAT IT DOES NOT ENFORCE ANY RANK CONSTRAINT OFTEN APPEARED IN OTHER WORK AND INSTEAD USES GPA CONSTRAINTS TO RESOLVE THE AMBIGUITY IN FINDING SCALES, ROTATIONS, AND 3D SHAPES. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT EM GPA CAN RECOVER DEPTH INFORMATION ACCURATELY EVEN WHEN THE NOISE LEVEL IS HIGH AND THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF MISSING VARIABLES. BY USING THE IMAGES FROM THE FRGC DATABASE, WE SHOW THAT EM GPA CAN SUCCESSFULLY ALIGN 2D SHAPES BY TAKING THE MISSING INFORMATION INTO CONSIDERATION. WE ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE 3D MEAN SHAPE AND ITS COVARIANCE MATRIX ARE ACCURATELY ESTIMATED. AS AN APPLICATION OF EM GPA, WE CONSTRUCT A 2D + 3D AAM (ACTIVE APPEARANCE MODEL) USING THE 3D SHAPES OBTAINED BY EM GPA, AND IT GIVES A SIMILAR SUCCESS RATE IN MODEL FITTING COMPARED TO THE METHOD USING REAL 3D SHAPES. EM GPA IS NOT LIMITED TO THE CASE OF MISSING DEPTH INFORMATION, BUT IT CAN BE EASILY EXTENDED TO MORE GENERAL CASES. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

SINCE THEN, SIMILAR ANOMALIES HAVE BEEN DETECTED IN MORE THAN 120 CRETACEOUS PALEOGENE (K PG) BOUNDARY SITES WORLDWIDE. HIGHLY ELEVATED IR AND OTHER SIDEROPHILE ELEMENT ABUNDANCES IN ROUGHLY CHONDRITIC RATIOS ARE CONSIDERED STRONG INDICATORS FOR THE PRESENCE OF A METEORITIC CONTRIBUTION IN IMPACT RELATED LITHOLOGIES (MELT ROCKS, IMPACT EJECTA MATERIAL, ETC.), DELIVERED WHEN AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL OBJECT STRIKES EARTH. THE PRESENTED WORK ADDS 113 UNPUBLISHED PGE ANALYSES OF 38 K PG SECTIONS WORLDWIDE TO THE EXISTING LITERATURE. THE ANALYTICAL PROTOCOL RELIED ON FOR THIS PURPOSE CONSISTED OF A COMBINATION OF A NICKEL SULFIDE FIRE ASSAY PRE CONCENTRATION TECHNIQUE AND SUBSEQUENT TRACE METAL DETERMINATION VIA INDUCTIVELY COUPLED PLASMA MASS SPECTROMETRY (ICP MS). THROUGH REPEATED DETERMINATION OF KEY SIDEROPHILE ELEMENTS (I.E., CR, CO, NI, AND PGE), THE IMPORTANCE OF SAMPLING, NUGGET EFFECTS, AND ANALYTICAL METHODOLOGIES APPLIED BECOMES MORE APPARENT. EVEN MORE CRITICALLY, THESE ANALYTICAL EFFECTS ARE SUPERIMPOSED BY THE LOCAL SYN AND POST DEPOSITIONAL CONDITIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE PRISTINE METEORITIC SIGNATURE OF THE K PG IMPACTOR, INCLUDING POTENTIAL FRACTIONATION DURING VAPORIZATION AND CONDENSATION, DISSIMILAR PGE CARRIER PHASES, TERRESTRIAL PGE INPUT, SEDIMENTATION RATE, REWORKING, DIAGENESIS, BIOTURBATION, AND CHEMICAL DIFFUSION. WHILE CHONDRITE NORMALIZED PGE PATTERNS OF INDIVIDUAL SITES APPEAR RELATIVELY FLAT (I.E., CHONDRITIC), STRONG VARIATIONS IN SIDEROPHILE ELEMENT CONTENT AND INTER ELEMENT RATIOS EXIST BETWEEN K PG LOCATIONS, INTER LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS, AND REPLICATE ANALYSES, HAMPERING A PRECISE PROJECTILE IDENTIFICATION USING (HIGHLY) SIDEROPHILE ELEMENTS. ONLY WHEN CONSIDERING IMPROVED DATABASES OF SIDEROPHILE ELEMENT CONCENTRATIONS IN METEORITES, IN COMBINATION WITH LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS TO CALCULATE INTER ELEMENT RATIOS FROM A LARGE SUITE OF EJECTA DEPOSIT SITES, THE NATURE OF THE K PG PROJECTILE CAN BE RESOLVED. APPLICATION OF THIS METHODOLOGY TO AN EXTENSIVE DATA SET OF CONTINENTAL AND MARINE SITES, VERY PROXIMAL TO DISTAL TO THE CHICXULUB IMPACT STRUCTURE, SUPPORTS A CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITIC IMPACTOR (TYPE CM OR CO).

A NEAREST NEIGHBOR (NN) CLASSIFIER WITH DYNAMIC TIME WARPING (DTW) DISTANCE IS A STRONG SOLUTION IN THIS CONTEXT. ON THE OTHER HAND, FEATURE BASED APPROACHES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AS BOTH CLASSIFIERS AND TO PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE SERIES, BUT THESE APPROACHES HAVE PROBLEMS HANDLING TRANSLATIONS AND DILATIONS IN LOCAL PATTERNS. CONSIDERING THESE SHORTCOMINGS, WE PRESENT A FRAMEWORK TO CLASSIFY TIME SERIES BASED ON A BAG OF FEATURES REPRESENTATION (TSBF). MULTIPLE SUBSEQUENCES SELECTED FROM RANDOM LOCATIONS AND OF RANDOM LENGTHS ARE PARTITIONED INTO SHORTER INTERVALS TO CAPTURE THE LOCAL INFORMATION. CONSEQUENTLY, FEATURES COMPUTED FROM THESE SUBSEQUENCES MEASURE PROPERTIES AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND DILATIONS WHEN VIEWED FROM THE ORIGINAL SERIES. THIS PROVIDES A FEATURE BASED APPROACH THAT CAN HANDLE WARPING (ALTHOUGH DIFFERENTLY FROM DTW). MOREOVER, A SUPERVISED LEARNER (THAT HANDLES MIXED DATA TYPES, DIFFERENT UNITS, ETC.) INTEGRATES LOCATION INFORMATION INTO A COMPACT CODEBOOK THROUGH CLASS PROBABILITY ESTIMATES. ADDITIONALLY, RELEVANT GLOBAL FEATURES CAN EASILY SUPPLEMENT THE CODEBOOK. TSBF IS COMPARED TO NN CLASSIFIERS AND OTHER ALTERNATIVES (BAG OF WORDS STRATEGIES, SPARSE SPATIAL SAMPLE KERNELS, SHAPELETS). OUR EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT TSBF PROVIDES BETTER RESULTS THAN COMPETITIVE METHODS ON BENCHMARK DATASETS FROM THE UCR TIME SERIES DATABASE.	***

IN THIS META ANALYSIS, WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF (CAG)N REPEAT GENETIC POLYMORPHISMS ON THE INCIDENCE OF PROSTATE CANCER, PARTICULARLY AS REGARDS RACE, STUDY DESIGN AND THE NUMBER OF (CAG) N REPEATS. TO COLLECT ARTICLES PUBLISHED ON THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CAG REPEATS AND PROSTATE CANCER, PUBLICATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED FROM THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY INFORMATION (NCBI) DATABASE OF EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES PUBLISHED UP TO OCTOBER 2011; OUR IDENTIFICATION OF PUBLICATIONS WAS NOT LIMITED BY A LANGUAGE BARRIER. THE FOLLOWING SEARCH KEYWORDS WERE USED: PROSTATE CANCER RISK, CAG REPEAT POLYMORPHISM, ANDROGEN RECEPTOR GENE AND HUMAN. STATA VERSION 10 WAS USED FOR THE META ANALYSIS AND THE PUBLICATION BIAS WAS MEASURED THROUGH THE BEGGS TEST AND EGGERS TEST. THIS META ANALYSIS INCLUDED 47 STUDIES WITH 13,346 CASES AND 15,172 CONTROL OR NON CASES AND CONSISTED OF 31 REPORTS BASED ON CAUCASIANS, TEN ON ASIANS, ONE ON HISPANICS AND FOUR ON COMBINED ETHNIC GROUPS. THE CARRIERS OF A SHORTER CAG REPEAT SEQUENCE HAD AN INCREASED RISK OF PROSTATE CANCER (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10 1.34 FOR ALL SUBJECTS; OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10 1.34 FOR PROSPECTIVE STUDIES; OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.15 1.51 FOR RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES) REGARDLESS OF THE EXACT LENGTH OF THE CAG REPEAT, COMPARED WITH CARRIERS OF A LONGER REPEAT SEQUENCE. IN TERMS OF RACE, THE RISK OF CARRYING A SHORTER CAG REPEAT SEQUENCE WAS 1.10 AND 1.83 FOLD HIGHER THAN THAT OF A LONGER REPEAT SEQUENCE IN CAUCASIANS AND ASIANS, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE SPECIFIC NUMBER OF CAG REPEAT POLYMORPHISMS, CARRIERS OF <22 REPEATS WERE OBSERVED TO HAVE A HIGHER RISK OF PROSTATE CANCER (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.04 1.29) COMPARED WITH CARRIERS WITH > 22 CAG REPEAT POLYMORPHISMS, PARTICULARLY FOR ASIANS (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.00 4.24). THIS META ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT A SHORTER CAG REPEAT POLYMORPHISM MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF PROSTATE CANCER COMPARED WITH THE LONGER CAG REPEAT; IN PARTICULAR, THE EFFECT OF SHORTER CAG REPEATS ON THE INCREASED RISK OF PROSTATE CANCER WAS PREDOMINANTLY OBSERVED IN CAUCASIANS AND ASIANS.	***

HOWEVER, FEW GENES WHICH SHOW METHYLATION CHANGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROGRESSION OF BREAST CANCER HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. TO IDENTIFY GENES WHICH CONSISTENTLY UNDERGO PROMOTER METHYLATION ALTERATIONS AS THE TUMOR DEVELOPS FROM A BENIGN TO A MALIGNANT FORM, GENOME WIDE METHYLATION DATABASES OF BREAST CANCER CELL LINES FROM STAGE I TO STAGE IV WERE ANALYZED. HEATMAP AND CLUSTER ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE GENOME WIDE METHYLATION CHANGES SHOWED A GOOD ACCORDANCE WITH TUMOR PROGRESSION. SEVEN OUT OF 14,495 GENES WERE FOUND TO BE CONSISTENTLY INCREASED ALONGSIDE THE PROMOTER METHYLATION LEVEL THROUGH THE NORMAL CELL LINE TO THE CANCER STAGE IV CELL LINES. NEFL, ONE OF THE IN SILICO HYPERMETHYLATED GENES IN CANCER, SHOWED HYPERMETHYLATION AND LOWER EXPRESSION IN THE CANCER CELL LINE MDA MB 231, AS WELL AS IN CANCER TISSUES (METHYLATION, P<0.05; EXPRESSION, P<0.01). THE EXPRESSION WAS RESTORED BY INDUCING DEMETHYLATION OF THE PROMOTER IN MDA MB 231 CELLS.

THEY ALSO ENABLE A WIDE VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS THAT IN TURN IDENTIFY DETAILED AND INTEGRATED 3D LEGAL AND PHYSICAL OBJECTS FOR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND CITY SPACE MANAGEMENT (3D LAND USE MANAGEMENT). EFFICIENT DELIVERY AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE APPLICATIONS REQUIRE MANY ELEMENTS TO SUPPORT A DIGITAL 3D CADASTRE, SUCH AS EXISTING 3D PROPERTY REGISTRATION LAWS, APPROPRIATE 3D DATA ACQUISITION METHODS, 3D SPATIAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, AND FUNCTIONAL 3D VISUALISATION PLATFORMS. IN ADDITION, AN APPROPRIATE 3D CADASTRAL DATA MODEL CAN ALSO PLAY A KEY ROLE TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF THE 3D CADASTRE. A 3D CADASTRAL DATA MODEL NEEDS TO REFLECT THE COMPLEXITY AND INTERRELATIONS OF 3D LEGAL OBJECTS AND THEIR PHYSICAL COUNTERPARTS. MANY JURISDICTIONS HAVE DEFINED THEIR OWN CADASTRAL DATA MODELS FOR LEGAL PURPOSES AND HAVE NEGLECTED THE THIRD DIMENSION, INTEGRATION OF PHYSICAL COUNTERPARTS AND SEMANTIC ASPECTS. TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS, THIS PAPER AIMS TO INVESTIGATE WHY EXISTING CADASTRAL DATA MODELS DO NOT FACILITATE EFFECTIVE REPRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF 3D DATA, INTEGRATION OF 3D LEGAL OBJECTS WITH THEIR PHYSICAL COUNTERPARTS, AND SEMANTICS. THEN, A 3D CADASTRAL DATA MODEL (3DCDM) IS PROPOSED AS A SOLUTION TO IMPROVE THE CURRENT CADASTRAL DATA MODELS. THE DATA MODEL IS DEVELOPED BASED ON THE ISO STANDARDS.

WE, ALONG WITH OTHER RESEARCHERS, HAVE RECENTLY FOUND QUANTITATIVE ULTRASOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE AS A SKIN TOXICITY ASSESSMENT TOOL. ALTHOUGH MORE RELIABLE THAN STANDARD CLINICAL EVALUATIONS (VISUAL OBSERVATION AND PALPATION), THE CURRENT PROCEDURE FOR ULTRASOUND BASED SKIN TOXICITY MEASUREMENTS REQUIRES MANUAL DELINEATION OF THE SKIN LAYERS (I.E., EPIDERMIS DERMIS AND DERMIS HYPODERMIS INTERFACES) ON EACH ULTRASOUND B MODE IMAGE. MANUAL SKIN SEGMENTATION IS TIME CONSUMING AND SUBJECTIVE. MOREOVER, RADIATION INDUCED SKIN INJURY MAY DECREASE IMAGE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE DERMIS AND HYPODERMIS, WHICH INCREASES THE DIFFICULTY OF DELINEATION. THEREFORE, WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN AUTOMATIC SKIN SEGMENTATION TOOL (ASST) BASED ON THE ACTIVE CONTOUR MODEL WITH TWO SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATIONS: (I) THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM INTRODUCES A NOVEL DUAL CURVE SCHEME FOR THE DOUBLE SKIN LAYER EXTRACTION, AS OPPOSED TO THE ORIGINAL SINGLE ACTIVE CONTOUR METHOD. (II) THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM IS BASED ON A GEOMETRIC CONTOUR FRAMEWORK AS OPPOSED TO THE PREVIOUS PARAMETRIC ALGORITHM. THIS ASST ALGORITHM WAS TESTED ON A BREAST CANCER IMAGE DATABASE OF 730 ULTRASOUND BREAST IMAGES (73 ULTRASOUND STUDIES OF 23 PATIENTS). WE COMPARED SKIN SEGMENTATION RESULTS OBTAINED WITH THE ASST WITH MANUAL CONTOURS PERFORMED BY TWO PHYSICIANS. THE AVERAGE PERCENTAGE DIFFERENCES IN SKIN THICKNESS BETWEEN THE ASST MEASUREMENT AND THAT OF EACH PHYSICIAN WERE LESS THAN 5% (4.8 +/ 17.8% AND 3.8 +/ 21.1%, RESPECTIVELY). IN SUMMARY, WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN AUTOMATIC SKIN SEGMENTATION METHOD THAT ENSURES OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF RADIATION INDUCED CHANGES IN SKIN THICKNESS. OUR ULTRASOUND TECHNOLOGY OFFERS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO QUANTIFY TISSUE INJURY IN A MORE MEANINGFUL AND REPRODUCIBLE MANNER THAN THE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENTS CURRENTLY EMPLOYED IN THE CLINIC.

BREAST CANCER IS ONE OF THE FEW CANCERS THAT CAN BE EARLY DETECTED, AND THE SURVIVAL RATE OF THE WOMEN WHOSE BREAST CANCERS ARE DETECTED ON THEIR INITIAL STAGE IS VIRTUALLY 100%. AT THE PRESENT TIME, ULTRASOUND (US) IS THE MOST IMPORTANT IMAGING TEST TOGETHER WITH THE MAMMOGRAM FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION OF THE BREAST. RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT ULTRASOUND, IN ADDITION TO MAMMOGRAPHY, HELPS DOCTORS TO SPOT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CANCERS COMPARED WITH MAMMOGRAMS ALONE.

HOWEVER IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN EARLY RELAPSES, WE HAD TO POSTULATE THAT SOMETHING HAPPENS AT ABOUT THE TIME OF SURGERY TO PROVOKE SUDDEN EXITS FROM DORMANT PHASES TO ACTIVE GROWTH AND THEN TO DETECTION. MOST RELAPSES IN BREAST CANCER ARE IN THE EARLY CATEGORY. RECENT DATA FROM FORGET ET AL. SUGGEST AN UNEXPECTED MECHANISM. THEY RETROSPECTIVELY STUDIED RESULTS FROM 327 CONSECUTIVE BREAST CANCER PATIENTS COMPARING VARIOUS PERIOPERATIVE ANALGESICS AND ANESTHETICS IN ONE BELGIAN HOSPITAL AND ONE SURGEON. PATIENTS WERE TREATED WITH MASTECTOMY AND CONVENTIONAL ADJUVANT THERAPY. RELAPSE HAZARD UPDATED SEPT 2011 ARE PRESENTED. A COMMON NON STEROIDAL ANTI INFLAMMATORY DRUG (NSAID) ANALGESIC USED IN SURGERY PRODUCED FAR SUPERIOR DISEASE FREE SURVIVAL IN THE FIRST 5 YEARS AFTER SURGERY. THE EXPECTED PROMINENT EARLY RELAPSE EVENTS IN MONTHS 9 18 ARE REDUCED 5 FOLD. IF THIS OBSERVATION HOLDS UP TO FURTHER SCRUTINY, IT COULD MEAN THAT THE SIMPLE USE OF THIS SAFE, INEXPENSIVE AND EFFECTIVE ANTI INFLAMMATORY AGENT AT SURGERY MIGHT ELIMINATE EARLY RELAPSES. TRANSIENT SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION ACCOMPANYING SURGERY COULD FACILITATE ANGIOGENESIS OF DORMANT MICROMETASTASES, PROLIFERATION OF DORMANT SINGLE CELLS, AND SEEDING OF CIRCULATING CANCER STEM CELLS (PERHAPS IN PART RELEASED FROM BONE MARROW) RESULTING IN EARLY RELAPSE AND COULD HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVELY BLOCKED BY THE PERIOPERATIVE ANTI INFLAMMATORY AGENT.	***

EVALUATIONS ON THREE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATABASES (LIVE, CSIQ, AND TID2008) SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED METRIC, DESPITE REQUIRING LESS COMPUTATION, COMPARES FAVOURABLY IN PERFORMANCE TO SEVERAL EXISTING IQMS. IN ADDITION, DUE TO ITS SIMPLICITY, MSE SSIM IS AMENABLE FOR THE USE IN A WIDE RANGE OF IMAGE AND VIDEO TASKS THAT INVOLVE SOLVING AN OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM. AS AN EXAMPLE, MSE SSIM IS USED AS THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION IN DESIGNING A WIENER FILTER THAT AIMS AT OPTIMIZING THE PERCEPTUAL VISUAL QUALITY OF THE OUTPUT.

METAZOAN PHYLOGENY WAS RECENTLY CHALLENGED BY LARGE SCALE EST APPROACHES (PHYLOGENOMICS), STABILIZING CLASSICAL NODES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY SUPPORTING NEW SISTER GROUP HYPOTHESES. THE USE OF MITOCHONDRIAL DATA IN DEEP PHYLOGENY ANALYSES WAS OFTEN CRITICIZED BECAUSE OF HIGH SUBSTITUTION RATES ON NUCLEOTIDES, LARGE DIFFERENCES IN AMINO ACID SUBSTITUTION RATE BETWEEN TAXA, AND BIASES IN NUCLEOTIDE FREQUENCIES. NEVERTHELESS, MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME DATA MIGHT STILL BE PROMISING AS IT ALLOWS FOR A LARGER TAXON SAMPLING, WHILE PRESENTING A SMALLER AMOUNT OF SEQUENCE INFORMATION. WE PRESENT THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF BILATERIAN RELATIONSHIPS BASED ON MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME DATA. THE ANALYZED DATA SET COMPRISES MORE THAN 650 MITOCHONDRIAL GENOMES THAT HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO REPRESENT A PROFOUND SAMPLE OF THE PHYLOGENETIC AS WELL AS SEQUENCE DIVERSITY. THE RESULTS ARE BASED ON HIGH QUALITY AMINO ACID ALIGNMENTS OBTAINED FROM A COMPLETE REANNOTATION OF THE MITOGENOMIC SEQUENCES FROM NCBI REFSEQ DATABASE. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS FAILED TO GIVE SUPPORT FOR MANY OTHERWISE UNDISPUTED HIGH RANKING TAXA, LIKE MOLLUSCA, HEXAPODA, ARTHROPODA, AND SUFFER FROM EXTREME LONG BRANCHES OF NEMATODA, PLATYHELMINTHES, AND SOME OTHER TAXA. IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCES OF MISLEADING PHYLOGENETIC SIGNALS, WE DISCUSS SEVERAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME DATA SETS, E.G. THE NUCLEOTIDE AND AMINO ACID LANDSCAPES AND A STRONG CORRELATION OF GENE REARRANGEMENTS WITH LONG BRANCHES. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

RAB38 IS EXPRESSED IN MELANOCYTES AND IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT A POINT MUTATION IN THE POSTULATED GTP BINDING DOMAIN OF RAB38 IS THE GENE RESPONSIBLE FOR HUMAN HERMANSKY PUDLAK SYNDROME. HOWEVER, THE PROGNOSTIC AND MOLECULAR FEATURES OF TUMORS WITH RAB38 EXPRESSION IS STILL UNCLEAR, AS WELL AS GLIOMA. WHOLE GENOME MRNA EXPRESSION MICROARRAY DATA ON 220 GLIOMA SAMPLES FROM THE CHINESE GLIOMA GENOME ATLAS (CGGA) DATABASE (HTTP://WWW.CGGA.ORG.CN) WAS APPLIED AS DISCOVERY SET. EACH GRADE OF GLIOMA PATIENTS WAS ANALYZED BY THE KAPLAN MEIER METHOD. TO DETERMINE THE PROTEIN EXPRESSION LEVELS OF RAB38, FURTHER 82 GLIOMA TISSUES WERE STAINED BY IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY. THREE ADDITIONAL DATASETS (TCGA, GSE16011 AND REMBRANDT) WERE OBTAINED AS VALIDATION SETS. THE FUNCTIONAL ANNOTATION OF RAB38 WAS ANALYZED BY GENE ONTOLOGY (GO) ANALYSIS AND GENE SET VARIATION ANALYSIS (GSVA) IN 89 GLIOBLASTOMAS (GBMS). HIGH RAB38 EXPRESSION WAS MAINLY INCREASED IN HIGH GRADE GLIOMAS, AND HIGH RAB38 EXPRESSION ALSO CONFERRED HIGH MORTALITY OF GLIOMA IN THE CGGA COHORT. RAB38 SHOWED A MESENCHYMAL SUBTYPE, G3 SUBTYPE AND ISOCITRATE DEHYDROGENASE 1 (IDH1) WILD TYPE PREFERENCE. GO AND GSVA ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT RAB38 WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH MIGRATION. THESE RESULTS WERE VALIDATED IN OTHER 3 DATASETS. THE EXPRESSION LEVELS OF RAB38 WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH GRADE PROGRESSION AS WELL AS PROGNOSIS IN GLIOMAS. RAB38 IS AN IMPORTANT PROGNOSTIC BIOMARKER AND POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC TARGET IN GLIOMAS.	***

THIS REPRESENTATION CANNOT FULLY EXPLOIT THE COMPLEMENTARY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MOTIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT SCALES. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, WE INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF LEARNING MULTIPLE DICTIONARIES OF ACTION PRIMITIVES AT DIFFERENT RESOLUTIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY, MULTIPLE SCALE SPECIFIC REPRESENTATIONS FOR A GIVEN VIDEO SAMPLE.

IN THE LAST FEW YEARS MODELS OF INCREASING COMPLEXITY HAVE BEEN PROPOSED IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE IN THE TASK. HOWEVER, IT STILL REMAINS UNCLEAR WHETHER IT IS THE FEATURES OR THE MODELS WHAT DESERVES THE INCREASE IN COMPLEXITY. IN THIS PAPER AN EVALUATION OF SUCH PROBLEM IS CARRIED OUT IN THE HIR TASK. FOR THAT PURPOSE, WE COMPARE THE RESULTS OBTAINED IN OUR EXPERIMENTS BY USING STIP BASED FEATURES AND BOW MODELS AS BASIS AND COMBINED WITH A STANDARD CLASSIFIER WITH SOME OF THE MORE EFFECTIVE AND RECENT APPROACHES THAT USE ALTERNATIVE REPRESENTATION MODELS. WE PERFORM A COMPREHENSIVE EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON TWO STATE OF THE ART DATABASES IN HIR: TV HUMAN INTERACTIONS AND UT INTERACTIONS. WE COMPARE THE RESULTS OF OUR EXPERIMENTS WITH RECENT RESULTS PUBLISHED ON THESE DATASETS. IN ADDITION, WE RUN CROSS DATA EXPERIMENTS ON HOLLYWOOD 2 DATASET IN ORDER TO STUDY THE CAPABILITY OF GENERALIZATION OF THE TRAINED MODELS THROUGH DIFFERENT DATASETS. THE MOST RELEVANT RESULT IS THAT THE MODEL COMBINING STIP + BOW IS COMPETITIVE IN THE HIR TASK IN COMPARISON WITH THE MOST COMPLEX ONES. IT IS ALSO SHOWN THAT THE VOCABULARY LEARNING SUBTASK CAN BE IMPROVED BY USING COMPRESSION ALGORITHMS ON LARGE ENOUGH INITIAL SET OF FEATURES. IN CONTRAST TO OTHER CATEGORIZATION TASKS THE CONTEXT DOES NOT HELP, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT DENSE SAMPLING OF STIP IS THE BEST CHOICE, BUT ONLY WHEN IT IS USED INSIDE THE REGION OF INTEREST OF THE INTERACTION.

FOR SURVEILLANCE APPLICATIONS AUDIO VISUAL FUSION IS VERY PROMISING GIVEN THE COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE TWO STREAMS. HOWEVER, DRAWING THE CORRECT CONCLUSION FROM MULTI SENSOR DATA IS NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD. IN PREVIOUS WORK WE HAVE ANALYSED A DATABASE WITH AUDIOVISUAL RECORDINGS OF UNWANTED BEHAVIOR IN TRAINS (LEFTER ET AL., 2012) AND FOCUSED ON A LIMITED SUBSET OF THE RECORDED DATA. WE HAVE COLLECTED MULTI AND UNIMODAL ASSESSMENTS BY HUMANS, WHO HAVE GIVEN AGGRESSION SCORES ON A 3 POINT SCALE. WE SHOWED THAT THERE ARE NO TRIVIAL FUSION ALGORITHMS TO PREDICT THE MULTIMODAL LABELS FROM THE UNIMODAL LABELS SINCE PART OF THE INFORMATION IS LOST WHEN USING THE UNIMODAL STREAMS. WE PROPOSED AN INTERMEDIATE STEP TO DISCOVER THE STRUCTURE IN THE FUSION PROCESS. THIS STEP IS BASED UPON META FEATURES AND WE FIND A SET OF FIVE WHICH HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE FUSION PROCESS. IN THIS PAPER WE EXTEND THE FINDINGS IN (LEFTER ET AL., 2012) FOR THE GENERAL CASE USING THE ENTIRE DATABASE. WE PROVE THAT THE META FEATURES HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE FUSION PROCESS IN TERMS OF LABELS. WE THEN COMPARE THREE FUSION METHODS THAT ENCAPSULATE THE META FEATURES. THEY ARE BASED ON AUTOMATIC PREDICTION OF THE INTERMEDIATE LEVEL VARIABLES AND MULTIMODAL AGGRESSION FROM STATE OF THE ART LOW LEVEL ACOUSTIC, LINGUISTIC AND VISUAL FEATURES. THE FIRST FUSION METHOD IS BASED ON APPLYING MULTIPLE CLASSIFIERS TO PREDICT INTERMEDIATE LEVEL FEATURES FROM THE LOW LEVEL FEATURES, AND TO PREDICT THE MULTIMODAL LABEL FROM THE INTERMEDIATE VARIABLES. THE OTHER TWO APPROACHES ARE BASED ON PROBABILISTIC GRAPHICAL MODELS, ONE USING (DYNAMIC) BAYESIAN NETWORKS AND THE OTHER ONE USING CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELDS. WE LEARN THAT EACH APPROACH HAS ITS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES IN PREDICTING SPECIFIC AGGRESSION CLASSES AND USING THE META FEATURES YIELDS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL CASES. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER B.V.

TO TEST AND VALIDATE THIS APPROACH, WE USE SILHOUETTES OF SUBJECTS PERFORMING TEN ACTIONS FROM A COMMONLY USED VIDEO DATABASE BY ACTION RECOGNITION RESEARCHERS. A MORPHOLOGICAL ALGORITHM IS USED TO FILTER NOISE FROM THE SILHOUETTE. A CONVEX HULL IS THEN CREATED AROUND THE SILHOUETTE FRAME, FROM WHICH CONVEX DEFECTS WILL BE USED AS THE FEATURES FOR ANALYSIS. A COMPLETE FEATURE CONSISTS OF THIRTY INDIVIDUAL VALUES WHICH REPRESENT THE FIVE LARGEST CONVEX HULL DEFECTS AREAS. A CONSECUTIVE SEQUENCE OF THESE FEATURES FORM A COMPLETE ACTION. ACTION FRAME SEQUENCES ARE PREPROCESSED TO SEPARATE THE DATA INTO TWO SETS BASED ON PERSPECTIVE PLANES AND BILATERAL SYMMETRY. FEATURES ARE THEN NORMALIZED TO CREATE A FINAL SET OF ACTION SEQUENCES. WE THEN FORMULATE AND INVESTIGATE THREE METHODS TO CLASSIFY TEN ACTIONS FROM THE DATABASE. TESTING AND TRAINING OF THE NINE TEST SUBJECTS IS PERFORMED USING A LEAVE ONE OUT METHODOLOGY. CLASSIFICATION UTILIZES BOTH PCA AND MINIMALLY ENCODED NEURAL NETWORKS. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION RESULTS SHOW THAT THE HULL CONVEXITY DEFECT ALGORITHM PROVIDES COMPARABLE RESULTS WITH LESS COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY.

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	***

PROCEDUREWE RETROSPECTIVELY REVIEWED TWO PATIENTS FROM THE SENIOR AUTHORS PERSONAL SERIES AND 25 CASES IDENTIFIED IN THE DATABASES OF SEVERAL MULTICENTER GROUP STUDIES (INT 0098, P9645, 881, P9346, HB 89, HB94, AND HB 99). WE COMPARED THIS SERIES WITH CASES OF CONGENITAL HEPATOBLASTOMA PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED IN THE LITERATURE. RESULTSTHE 3 YEAR SURVIVAL IN OUR CASE SERIES WAS 86% (18/21) WITH A FOLLOW UP OF 44 230 MONTHS (MEDIAN 85.5 MONTHS). PRESENTATION AND TREATMENT WERE NOT SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM HEPATOBLASTOMA COHORTS UNSELECTED FOR AGE. SURVIVAL WAS COMPARABLE TO THE REPORTED DISEASE FREE SURVIVAL FOR A SIMILAR COHORT OF HEPATOBLASTOMA PATIENTS UNSELECTED FOR AGE BETWEEN 1986 AND 2002 (82.5%) [VON SCHWEINITZ ET AL., EUR J CANCER 1997; 33:1243 1249]. THE 2 YEAR SURVIVAL OF CASES REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE WAS 0% (0/9) AND 42% (10/24) FOR PATIENTS REPORTED BEFORE AND AFTER 1990, RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSIONSCONGENITAL HEPATOBLASTOMA DOES NOT APPEAR TO CONFER A WORSE PROGNOSIS. THE IMPROVED SURVIVAL OF OUR CURRENT SERIES OF PATIENTS, COLLECTED FROM THE PAST 20 YEARS OF GERMAN AND AMERICAN MULTICENTER TRIALS AND PERSONAL SERIES, SUGGESTS THAT THE OUTCOME OF HEPATOBLASTOMA AT THIS YOUNG AGE IS MUCH BETTER THAN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY REPORTED. MORE RIGOROUS ANALYSIS SHOULD BE CONDUCTED IN FUTURE MULTICENTER TRIALS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CONGENITAL HEPATOBLASTOMA SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE ALL OTHER PATIENTS WITH HEPATOBLASTOMA PROVIDED THAT THE CHILD IS STABLE ENOUGH TO PROCEED WITH SURGERY AND CHEMOTHERAPY.

	GRRRU	UNIV CALIF BERKELEY								UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,UNITED STATES OF AMERICA								TOWARD A RESTRICTION CENTERED THEORY OF TRUTH AND MEANING (RCT)	2013	INFORMATION SCIENCES	248		1	PRECISIATION OF MEANING	COMPUTATION WITH RESTRICTIONS	ASSESSMENT OF TRUTH VALUE	FORMALIZATION OF EVERYDAY REASONING			1	SIN CORRESPONDIG	WHAT IS TRUTH? THE QUESTION DOES NOT ADMIT A SIMPLE, PRECISE ANSWER. A DICTIONARY STYLE DEFINITION IS: THE TRUTH VALUE OF A PROPOSITION, P, IS THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE MEANING OF P IS IN AGREEMENT WITH FACTUAL INFORMATION, F. A PRECISE DEFINITION OF TRUTH WILL BE FORMULATED AT A LATER POINT IN THIS PAPER. THE THEORY OUTLINED IN THE FOLLOWING, CALL IT RCT FOR SHORT, IS A DEPARTURE FROM TRADITIONAL THEORIES OF TRUTH AND MEANING. IN RCT, TRUTH VALUES ARE ALLOWED TO BE DESCRIBED IN NATURAL LANGUAGE. EXAMPLES. QUITE TRUE, MORE OR LESS TRUE, ALMOST TRUE, LARGELY TRUE, POSSIBLY TRUE, PROBABLY TRUE, USUALLY TRUE, ETC. SUCH TRUTH VALUES ARE REFERRED TO AS LINGUISTIC TRUTH VALUES. LINGUISTIC TRUTH VALUES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN TRADITIONAL LOGICAL SYSTEMS, BUT ARE ROUTINELY USED BY HUMANS IN EVERYDAY REASONING AND EVERYDAY DISCOURSE. THE CENTERPIECE OF RCT IS A DECEPTIVELY SIMPLE CONCEPT THE CONCEPT OF A RESTRICTION. INFORMALLY, A RESTRICTION, R(X), ON A VARIABLE, X, IS AN ANSWER TO A QUESTION OF THE FORM: WHAT IS THE VALUE OF X? POSSIBLE ANSWERS: X 10, X IS BETWEEN 3 AND 20, X IS MUCH LARGER THAN 2, X IS LARGE, PROBABLY X IS LARGE, USUALLY X IS LARGE, ETC. IN RCT, RESTRICTIONS ARE PREPONDERANTLY DESCRIBED IN NATURAL LANGUAGE. AN EXAMPLE OF A FAIRLY COMPLEX DESCRIPTION IS: IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF OIL IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THE CANONICAL FORM OF A RESTRICTION, R(X), IS X ISR R, WHERE X IS THE RESTRICTED VARIABLE, R IS THE RESTRICTING RELATION, AND R IS AN INDEXICAL VARIABLE WHICH DEFINES THE WAY IN WHICH R RESTRICTS X. X MAY BE AN N ARY VARIABLE AND R MAY BE AN N ARY RELATION. THE CANONICAL FORM MAY BE INTERPRETED AS A GENERALIZED ASSIGNMENT STATEMENT IN WHICH WHAT IS ASSIGNED TO X IS NOT A VALUE OF X, BUT A RESTRICTION ON THE VALUES WHICH X CAN TAKE. A RESTRICTION, R(X), IS A CARRIER OF INFORMATION ABOUT X. A RESTRICTION IS PRECISIATED IF X, R AND R ARE MATHEMATICALLY WELL DEFINED. A KEY IDEA WHICH UNDERLIES RCT IS REFERRED TO AS THE MEANING POSTULATE, MP. MP POSTULATES THAT THE MEANING OF A PROPOSITION DRAWN FROM A NATURAL LANGUAGE, P OR SIMPLY P MAY BE REPRESENTED AS A RESTRICTION, P > X ISR R. THIS EXPRESSION IS REFERRED TO AS THE CANONICAL FORM OF P, CF(P). GENERALLY, THE VARIABLES X, R AND R ARE IMPLICIT IN P. SIMPLY STATED, MP POSTULATES THAT A PROPOSITION DRAWN FROM A NATURAL LANGUAGE MAY BE INTERPRETED AS AN IMPLICIT ASSIGNMENT STATEMENT. MP PLAYS AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN DEFINING THE MEANING OF, AND COMPUTING WITH, PROPOSITIONS DRAWN FROM NATURAL LANGUAGE. WHAT SHOULD BE UNDERSCORED IS THAT IN RCT UNDERSTANDING OF MEANING IS TAKEN FOR GRANTED. WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS NOT UNDERSTANDING OF MEANING BUT PRECISIATION OF MEANING. PRECISIATION OF MEANING IS A PREREQUISITE TO REASONING AND COMPUTATION WITH INFORMATION DESCRIBED IN NATURAL LANGUAGE. PRECISIATION OF MEANING IS A DESIDERATUM IN ROBOTICS, MECHANIZATION OF DECISION MAKING, LEGAL REASONING, PRECISIATED LINGUISTIC SUMMARIZATION WITH APPLICATION TO DATA MINING AND OTHER FIELDS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT MOST BUT NOT ALL PROPOSITIONS DRAWN FROM NATURAL LANGUAGE ARE PRECISIABLE. IN RCT, TRUTH VALUES FORM A HIERARCHY. FIRST ORDER (GROUND LEVEL) TRUTH VALUES ARE NUMERICAL, LYING IN THE UNIT INTERVAL. LINGUISTIC TRUTH VALUES ARE SECOND ORDER TRUTH VALUES AND ARE RESTRICTIONS ON FIRST ORDER TRUTH VALUES. NTH ORDER TRUTH VALUES ARE RESTRICTIONS ON (N 1) ORDER TRUTH VALUES, ETC. ANOTHER KEY IDEA IS EMBODIED IN WHAT IS REFERRED TO AS THE TRUTH POSTULATE, TP. THE TRUTH POSTULATE, TP, EQUATES THE TRUTH VALUE OF P TO THE DEGREE TO WHICH X SATISFIES R. THIS DEFINITION OF TRUTH VALUE PLAYS AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN RCT. A DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF RCT IS THAT IN RCT A PROPOSITION, P, IS ASSOCIATED WITH TWO DISTINCT TRUTH VALUES INTERNAL TRUTH VALUE AND EXTERNAL TRUTH VALUE. THE INTERNAL TRUTH VALUE RELATES TO THE MEANING OF P. THE EXTERNAL TRUTH VALUE RELATES TO THE DEGREE OF AGREEMENT OF P WITH FACTUAL INFORMATION. TO COMPUTE THE DEGREE TO WHICH X SATISFIES R, IT IS NECESSARY TO PRECISIATE X, R AND R. IN RCT, WHAT IS USED FOR THIS PURPOSE IS THE CONCEPT OF AN EXPLANATORY DATABASE, ED. INFORMALLY, ED IS A COLLECTION OF RELATIONS WHICH REPRESENT THE INFORMATION WHICH IS NEEDED TO PRECISIATE X AND R OR, EQUIVALENTLJR;TO COMPUTE THE TRUTH VALUE OF P. PRECISIATED X, R AND P ARE DENOTED AS X*, R* AND P*, RESPECTIVELY. X AND R ARE PRECISIATED BY EXPRESSING THEM AS FUNCTIONS OF ED. THE PRECISIATED CANONICAL FORM, CF*(P), IS EXPRESSED AS X*ISR* R*. AT THIS POINT, THE NUMERICAL TRUTH VALUE OF P, NT(P), MAY BE COMPUTED AS THE DEGREE TO WHICH X* SATISFIES R*. IN RCT, THE FACTUAL INFORMATION, F, IS ASSUMED TO BE REPRESENTED AS A RESTRICTION ON ED. THE RESTRICTION ON ED INDUCES A RESTRICTION, T, ON NT(P) WHICH CAN BE COMPUTED THROUGH THE USE OF THE EXTENSION PRINCIPLE. THE COMPUTED RESTRICTION ON NTP IS APPROXIMATED TO BY A LINGUISTIC TRUTH VALUE, LT(P).

SPACE BIODOSIMETRY POSES SOME UNIQUE CHALLENGES COMPARED TO TERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS OF RADIATION EXPOSURES, BUT DATA PROVIDES A DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF SPACE RADIATION DAMAGE, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT INDIVIDUAL RADIOSENSITIVITY IN THE PRESENCE OF CONFOUNDING FACTORS SUCH AS MICROGRAVITY AND OTHER STRESS CONDITIONS. MOREOVER IF CHROMOSOME DAMAGE PERSISTS IN THE BLOOD FOR MANY YEARS, RESULTS CAN BE USED FOR RETROSPECTIVE DOSE RECONSTRUCTION. IN CONTRAST TO PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS, WHICH ARE EXTERNAL TO BODY AND REQUIRE MULTIPLE DEVICES TO DETECT ALL RADIATION TYPES ALL OF WHICH HAVE POOR SENSITIVITY TO NEUTRONS, BIODOSIMETRY IS INTERNAL AND INCLUDES THE EFFECTS OF SHIELDING PROVIDED BY THE BODY ITSELF PLUS CHROMOSOME DAMAGE SHOWS EXCELLENT SENSITIVITY TO PROTONS, HEAVY IONS, AND NEUTRONS. IN ADDITION, CHROMOSOME DAMAGE IS REFLECTIVE OF CANCER RISK AND BIODOSIMETRY VALUES CAN THEREFORE BE USED TO VALIDATE AND DEVELOP RISK ASSESSMENT MODELS THAT CAN BE USED TO CHARACTERIZE HEALTH RISK INCURRED BY CREWMEMBERS.

SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHT PERSONS AGED 85 YEARS AND OLDER FROM THE GERONTOLOGICAL REGIONAL DATABASE (GERDA) WERE ASSESSED. INFORMATION WAS ALSO COLLECTED FROM RELATIVES, CARERS AND MEDICAL RECORDS. ASSESSMENTS PERFORMED WERE AMONG OTHERS THE ORGANIC BRAIN SYNDROME (OBS) SCALE, THE MINI MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION (MMSE), AND THE GERIATRIC DEPRESSION SCALE 15 (GDS 15). DELIRIUM, DEPRESSION AND DEMENTIA DIAGNOSES WERE BASED ON THE DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS, FOURTH EDITION (DSM IV) CRITERIA. THE PREVALENCE OF DELIRIUM WAS 17% AMONG 85 YEAR OLDS, 21% AMONG 90 YEAR OLDS AND 39% AMONG PARTICIPANTS AGED 95 YEARS AND OLDER (P < 0.001). DELIRIUM PREVALENCE AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT DEMENTIA WAS LOWER THAN AMONG THOSE WITH DEMENTIA (5% VS. 52%, P < 0.001).

HOWEVER, SUCH MAPPING IS ONLY FEASIBLE FOR THE SOIL SURFACE BECAUSE THE EFFECTIVE PENETRATION DEPTHS OF OPTICAL SENSORS DO NOT EXCEED SEVERAL MILLIMETERS. THIS STUDY AIMS TO DETERMINE HOW VIS NIR HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGERY CAN SERVE TO MAP THE SUBSURFACE PROPERTIES AT FOUR DEPTH INTERVALS (15 30 CM, 30 60 CM, 60 100 CM AND 30 100 CM) WHEN USED WITH LEGACY SOIL PROFILES AND IMAGES OF PARAMETERS DERIVED FROM DIGITAL ELEVATION MODEL (DEM). TWO TYPES OF SURFACE SUBSURFACE FUNCTIONS, NAMELY LINEAR MODELS AND RANDOM FORESTS, THAT ESTIMATE SUBSURFACE PROPERTY VALUES FROM SURFACE VALUES AND LANDSCAPE COVARIATES WERE FIRST CALIBRATED OVER THE SET OF LEGACY MEASURED PROFILES. THESE FUNCTIONS WERE THEN APPLIED TO MAP THE SOIL PROPERTIES USING THE HYPERSPECTRAL DERIVED DIGITAL SURFACE SOIL PROPERTY MAPS AND THE IMAGES OF LANDSCAPE COVARIATES AS INPUT. ERROR PROPAGATION WAS ADDRESSED USING A MONTE CARLO APPROACH TO ESTIMATE THE MAPPING UNCERTAINTIES. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN A PEDOLOGICALLY CONTRASTED 300 KM(2) CULTIVATED AREA LOCATED IN THE CAP BON REGION (NORTHERN TUNISIA) AND TESTED ON THREE SOIL SURFACE PROPERTIES (CLAY AND SAND CONTENTS AND CATION EXCHANGE CAPACITY). THE MAIN RESULTS WERE AS FOLLOWS: I) FAIRLY SATISFACTORY (CROSS VALIDATION R 2 BETWEEN 0.55 AND 0.81) SURFACE SUBSURFACE FUNCTIONS WERE OBTAINED FOR PREDICTING THE SOIL PROPERTIES AT 15 30 CM AND 30 60 CM, WHEREAS PREDICTIONS AT 60 100 CM WERE LESS ACCURATE (R 2 BETWEEN 0.38 AND 0.43); II) LINEAR MODELS OUTPERFORMED RANDOM FOREST MODELS IN DEVELOPING SURFACE SUBSURFACE FUNCTIONS; III) DUE TO THE ERROR PROPAGATIONS, THE FINAL PREDICTED MAPS OF THE SUBSURFACE SOIL PROPERTIES CAPTURED FROM 1/3 TO 2/3 OF THE TOTAL VARIANCE WITH A SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASING PERFORMANCE WITH DEPTH; AND IV) THESE MAPS BROUGHT SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS OVER THE EXISTING SOIL MAPS OF THE REGION AND SHOWED SOIL PATTERNS THAT LARGELY AGREED WITH THE LOCAL PEDOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE.

MONTE CARLO SIMULATION ESTIMATES THE BIT ERROR PROBABILITY (BEP) OF THE SYSTEM ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIOS (SNRS). A PERFORMANCE DATABASE OF SIMULATION RUNS IS COLLECTED OVER A TARGETED SPACE OF SYSTEM CONFIGURATIONS. THIS DATABASE IS THEN MINED TO OBTAIN REGIONS OF THE CONFIGURATION SPACE THAT EXHIBIT ACCEPTABLE AVERAGE PERFORMANCE. THE SHAPE OF THE MINED REGIONS ILLUSTRATES THE JOINT INFLUENCE OF CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS ON SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. THE ROLE OF DATA MINING IN THIS APPLICATION IS TO PROVIDE EXPLAINABLE AND STATISTICALLY VALID DESIGN CONCLUSIONS.

AS SEVERAL REGIONS OF INTEREST MAY BE SCATTERED THROUGH THE SPACE, AN EFFECTIVE SEARCH ALGORITHM SHOULD BALANCE THE EXPLORATION OF THE SPACE TO FIND NEW POTENTIAL REGIONS OF INTEREST AND THE EXPLOITATION OF AREAS AROUND SAMPLES WHICH ARE KNOWN RELEVANT. HOWEVER, MANY ALGORITHMS CONCENTRATE THE SEARCH ON AREAS WHICH ARE CLOSE TO THE IMAGES THAT THE USER HAS MARKED AS RELEVANT, ACCORDING TO A DISTANCE FUNCTION IN THE (POSSIBLY DEFORMED) MULTIDIMENSIONAL FEATURE SPACE. THIS MAXIMIZES THE NUMBER OF RELEVANT IMAGES RETRIEVED AT THE FIRST ITERATIONS, BUT LIMITS THE DISCOVERY OF NEW REGIONS OF INTEREST AND MAY LEAVE UNEXPLORED A LARGE SECTION OF THE SPACE. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL HYBRID APPROACH THAT USES A SCATTERED SEARCH ALGORITHM BASED ON NSGA II (NON DOMINATED SORTING GENETIC ALGORITHM) ONLY AT THE FIRST ITERATION OF THE RELEVANCE FEEDBACK PROCESS, AND THEN SWITCHES TO AN EXPLOITATION ALGORITHM. THE COMBINED APPROACH HAS BEEN TESTED ON THREE DATABASES AND IN COMBINATION WITH SEVERAL OTHER METHODS.

TRIALS OF FULVESTRANT ARE LIMITED BY INCONSISTENT STUDY POPULATIONS AND DRUG DOSING. THE OPTIMAL USE OF FULVESTRANT IN ADVANCED BREAST CANCER IS THEREFORE UNCLEAR. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF ELECTRONIC DATABASES WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY RANDOMIZED TRIALS OF FULVESTRANT VERSUS OTHER ENDOCRINE THERAPY. THE HAZARD RATIOS (HR) FOR TIME TO PROGRESSION (UP) AND THE ODDS RATIOS (OR) FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAES), DISCONTINUATION OF TREATMENT DUE TO TOXICITY AND COMMONLY REPORTED TOXICITIES (HOT FLASHES, VENOUS THROMBOSIS, GASTROINTESTINAL DISTURBANCE, ARTHRALGIA, AND ASTHENIA) WERE POOLED IN A META ANALYSIS. META REGRESSION EXPLORED HETEROGENEITY IN STUDY POPULATION AND FULVESTRANT DOSING. RESULTS: EIGHT STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. OVERALL, THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN UP BETWEEN FULVESTRANT AND CONTROL GROUPS (HR: 0.94, P 0.18). ON META REGRESSION, FULVESTRANT SHOWED REDUCED HAZARDS FOR UP COMPARED TO AROMATASE INHIBITORS (AI) IF USED IN FIRST LINE, IN STUDIES WHERE FEWER PATIENTS RECEIVED ADJUVANT ENDOCRINE THERAPY AND AT HIGHER DOSES. RATES OF SAES AND TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION WERE SIMILAR FOR FULVESTRANT AND CONTROL GROUPS, BUT FULVESTRANT MONOTHERAPY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANTLY LESS ARTHRALGIA (OR: 0.73, P 0.02). THE ADDITION OF FULVESTRANT TO AI WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED TIT, BUT LED TO INCREASED TOXICITY. CONCLUSION: IN UNSELECTED PATIENTS, FULVESTRANT MONOTHERAPY IS ASSOCIATED WITH SIMILAR EFFICACY, BUT REDUCED ARTHRALGIA COMPARED WITH OTHER ENDOCRINE THERAPY OPTIONS. USE OF HIGH DOSE FULVESTRANT MONOTHERAPY IN FIRST LINE OR IN PATIENTS WITH LIMITED PRIOR EXPOSURE TO ADJUVANT ENDOCRINE THERAPY MAY DELAY PROGRESSION COMPARED WITH AI. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER LTD.

DEPENDING ON MANY ASPECTS (MANUFACTURING PROCESS, MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY, BOUNDARY CONDITIONS, ETC.) REAL COMPOSITE STRUCTURES MAY HAVE DEVIATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE CALCULATED RESPONSE (OR DETERMINISTIC RESPONSE). THESE ASPECTS LEAD TO A SOURCE OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE STRUCTURAL RESPONSE ASSOCIATED WITH CONSTITUENT PROPORTIONS, GEOMETRIC PARAMETERS OR OTHER UNEXPECTED AGENTS. UNCERTAINTIES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN A STRUCTURAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE PREDICTABILITY OF A GIVEN MODELING SCHEME. IN THIS STUDY A MODEL OF SHEAR DEFORMABLE COMPOSITE BEAMS IS EMPLOYED AS THE MEAN MODEL. THE PROBABILISTIC MODEL IS CONSTRUCTED BY ADOPTING RANDOM VARIABLES FOR THE UNCERTAIN PARAMETERS OF THE MODEL. THIS STRATEGY IS CALLED PARAMETRIC PROBABILISTIC APPROACH. THE PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTIONS OF THE RANDOM VARIABLES ARE CONSTRUCTED APPEALING TO THE MAXIMUM ENTROPY PRINCIPLE. THE CONTINUOUS MODEL IS DISCRETISED BY FINITE ELEMENTS AND THE MONTE CARLO METHOD IS EMPLOYED TO PERFORM THE SIMULATIONS, THEREAFTER A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED. NUMERICAL STUDIES ARE CARRIED OUT TO SHOW THE MAIN ADVANTAGES OF THE MODELING STRATEGIES EMPLOYED, AS WELL AS TO QUANTIFY THE PROPAGATION OF THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE DYNAMICS OF SLENDER COMPOSITE STRUCTURES.

THE EFFECTS OF THE AMOUNT OF CONFINEMENT, CROSS SECTIONAL ASPECT RATIO AND CORNER RADIUS WERE INVESTIGATED EXPERIMENTALLY THROUGH THE TESTS OF 24 CONCRETE FILLED FRP TUBES (CFFTS) THAT WERE MANUFACTURED USING UNIDIRECTIONAL CARBON FIBER SHEETS AND UHSC WITH 108 MPA AVERAGE COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH. AS THE FIRST EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION ON THE AXIAL COMPRESSIVE BEHAVIOR OF SQUARE AND RECTANGULAR UHSCFFTS, THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY REPORTED IN THIS PAPER ALLOWS A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CONCLUSIONS TO BE DRAWN. OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE, TEST RESULTS INDICATE THAT SUFFICIENTLY CONFINED SQUARE AND RECTANGULAR UHSCFFTS CAN EXHIBIT HIGHLY DUCTILE BEHAVIOR. THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT CONFINEMENT EFFECTIVENESS OF FRP TUBES INCREASES WITH AN INCREASE IN CORNER RADIUS AND AS SECTIONAL ASPECT RATIO APPROACHES UNITY. IT IS FOUND THAT UHSCFFTS HAVING TUBES OF LOW CONFINEMENT EFFECTIVENESS MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT STRENGTH LOSS ALONG THE INITIAL PORTIONS OF THE SECOND BRANCHES ON THEIR STRESS STRAIN CURVES. FURTHERMORE, IT IS OBSERVED THAT THE BEHAVIOR OF UHSCFFTS AT THIS REGION DIFFERS FROM THEIR NORMAL STRENGTH CONCRETE COUNTERPARTS AND IS MORE SENSITIVE TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONFINING TUBE. THE SECOND HALF OF THE PAPER PRESENTS THE PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT OF THE EXISTING FRP CONFINED CONCRETE MODELS IN PREDICTING THE ULTIMATE CONDITIONS OF THE HSC AND UHSCFFTS. THE RESULTS OF THIS ASSESSMENT DEMONSTRATE THAT THE EXISTING MODELS PROVIDE UNCONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES FOR SPECIMENS WITH HIGHER CONCRETE STRENGTHS. TO ADDRESS THIS, A NEW MODEL THAT WAS DEVELOPED ON THE BASIS OF A COMPREHENSIVE EXPERIMENTAL TEST DATABASE AND IS APPLICABLE TO BOTH NSC AND HSC OF STRENGTHS UP TO 120 MPA IS PROPOSED. THE MODEL COMPARISONS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PROPOSED MODEL PROVIDES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED PREDICTIONS OF THE ULTIMATE CONDITIONS OF FRP CONFINED HSC COMPARED TO THE EXISTING MODELS.

THE USE OF A NORMAL DATABASE IN QUANTITATIVE REGIONAL ANALYSIS FACILITATES THE DETECTION OF FUNCTIONAL ABNORMALITY IN INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP STUDIES BY ACCOUNTING FOR INTER SUBJECT VARIABILITY. THE ABILITY TO SIMULATE REALISTIC IMAGES WOULD ALLOW VARIOUS IMPORTANT AREAS RELATED TO THE USE OF NORMAL DATABASES TO BE STUDIED. THESE INCLUDE THE OPTIMISATION OF THE DETECTION OF ABNORMAL BLOOD FLOW AND THE PORTABILITY OF NORMAL DATABASES BETWEEN GAMMA CAMERA SYSTEMS. TO INVESTIGATE THIS FURTHER WE HAVE CONSTRUCTED A HARDWARE PHANTOM AND SCANNED VARIOUS CONFIGURATIONS OF RADIOACTIVE BRAIN PATTERNS AND SIMULATED SKULL CONFIGURATIONS. METHODS: A SUBRESOLUTION SANDWICH PHANTOM WAS CONSTRUCTED WITH A SIMULATED SKULL WHICH WAS ASSEMBLED USING A HIGH RESOLUTION SEGMENTED MR SCAN PRINTED WITH A (TCO4) TC 99M MIXTURE AND SCANNED USING A DOUBLE HEADED GAMMA CAMERA WITH PARALLEL HOLE COLLIMATORS. VARIOUS DIFFERENT GREY TO WHITE MATTER (GM:WM) RATIOS AND ALUMINIUM SIMULATED SKULL CONFIGURATIONS WERE USED. A SINGLE DIFFERENCE MEASURE BETWEEN THE PHANTOM DATA AND A CONTROL DATABASE MEAN IMAGE WAS USED FOR OPTIMISATION. THE REALISM OF PHANTOM DATA WAS ASSESSED USING STATISTICAL PARAMETRIC MAPPING (SPM) AND ROI ANALYSIS. RESULTS: OPTIMISATION WAS ACHIEVED WITH A RANGE OF WM:GM RATIOS FROM 1.9 TO 2.4:1 WITH VARIOUS SIMULATED SKULL CONFIGURATIONS. CONCLUSION: THE ABILITY TO SIMULATE REALISTIC HMPAO SPECT SCANS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED USING A SUBRESOLUTION SANDWICH PHANTOM. FURTHER WORK, INVOLVING SCANNING THE OPTIMISED PHANTOM ON DIFFERENT GAMMA CAMERA SYSTEMS AND COMPARISON WITH CAMERA SPECIFIC NORMAL DATABASES SHOULD FURTHER REFINE THE PHANTOM CONFIGURATION.

OVERALL INCIDENCE RESULTS FOR CHF IN THE COMBINED ANTI HER2 THERAPY AND THE ANTI HER2 MONOTHERAPY WERE 0.88% (95% CI: 0.47 1.64%) AND 1.49% (95% CI: 0.98 2.23%). THE INCIDENCE OF LVEF DECLINE WAS 3.1% (95% CI: 2.2 4.4%) AND 2.9% (95% CI: 2.1 4.1%), RESPECTIVELY. THE OR OF CHF BETWEEN ANTI HER2 COMBINATION AND MONOTHERAPY WAS 0.58 (95% CI: 0.26 1.27, P VALUE 0.17) WHILE THE OR OF LVEF DECLINE WAS 0.88 (95% CI: 0.53 1.48, P VALUE 0.64). THIS META ANALYSIS PROVIDES EVIDENCE SUPPORTING COMPARABLE CARDIAC TOXICITY BETWEEN ANTI HER2 COMBINATION THERAPY AND ANTI HER2 MONOTHERAPY. WHATS NEW? BREAST CANCERS CAUSED BY HER2 OVEREXPRESSION GENERALLY HAVE POOR PROGNOSIS. DRUGS TARGETING THE HER2 RECEPTOR CAN THWART THE CANCER, BUT ALSO INCREASE THE RISK OF HEART PROBLEMS. NEW TREATMENTS ARE COMING ALONG WHICH COMBINE TWO ANTI HER2 AGENTS FOR AN EVEN GREATER ANTICANCER EFFECT, BUT WILL THESE DUAL THERAPIES CAUSE WORSE CARDIAC EFFECTS? IN THIS REPORT, THE AUTHORS COLLECTED DATA FROM TRIALS COMPARING DUAL ANTI HER2 THERAPY WITH ANTI HER2 MONOTHERAPY, AND SPECIFICALLY LOOKED AT RISK OF CARDIAC SIDE EFFECTS. THEY CONCLUDE THAT DOUBLING UP ON ANTI HER2 DRUGS DID NOT INCREASE THE CARDIAC TOXICITY COMPARED WITH THE USE OF ANTI HER2 DRUGS INDIVIDUALLY.	***

THE CRITICAL MICELLE CONCENTRATIONS (CMC), THE DEGREE OF COUNTERION BINDING (BETA), THE ENTHALPIES (DELTA H M) AND ENTROPIES (DELTA S M) OF MICELLIZATION AS WELL AS THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE HEADGROUPS TO GIBBS FREE ENERGIES (DELTA G(M)(0)(HY)) WERE CALCULATED. APPROXIMATE RELATIVE PARTIAL ENTHALPIES (L 2) WERE EVALUATED AS FUNCTIONS OF CONCENTRATION FROM THE CALORIMETRIC CURVES. IN COMPARISON WITH DTAB, THE HYDROPHOBICITY OF C(12)GAB IS REDUCED BY AN EXTENT CORRESPONDING TO THE SHORTENING OF DTABS ALKYL CHAIN BY ONE METHYLENE GROUP. THE MICELLES OF C(12)GAB ARE HYDRATED BY ONE METHYLENE GROUP DEEPER THAN THOSE OF DTAB. THE FREE ENERGY OF THE TRANSFER OF THE HEADGROUP FROM THE BULK SOLUTION TO THE MICELLE IS MORE FAVORABLE FOR DTAB THAN C(12)GAB. THIS EFFECT IS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE DELTA G(M)(0)(CH2) CONTRIBUTION. IN CONTRAST TO THE USUAL IONIC SURFACTANT BEHAVIOR, THE DEGREE OF COUNTERIONS BINDING FOR C(N)GABS DECREASES WITH INCREASING ALKYL CHAIN LENGTH. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A CONSEQUENCE OF SCREENING OF THE CHARGED LAYER OF THE MICELLE BY THE LARGE, HYDRATED AND HYDROGEN BONDED HEADGROUPS FROM THE BROMIDE ANIONS IN BULK SOLUTION. THE COMPUTATIONAL MODELING MADE IT POSSIBLE TO RELATE THE SURFACTANTS MOLECULAR PROPERTIES TO THE INTERACTIONS THE SURFACTANTS ENTER INTO, SUGGESTING THAT, DUE TO THE STRONGLY POLAR CHARACTER OF THEIR HEADGROUP, C(N)GABS FORM SMALL PREMICELLAR AGGREGATES.

IN THE COURSE OF LINEAMENT EXTRACTION, SATELLITE IMAGES, AEROMAGNETIC DATA, DIGITAL ELEVATION MODEL (DEM) AND STRUCTURAL MAPS WERE PROCESSED AND THE LINEAMENTS AND LARGE SCALE FAULTS WERE IDENTIFIED. THE EXTRACTED LINEAMENTS, BASED ON SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT, FROM EACH DATASET WERE IMPORTED INTO GIS SOFTWARE AND THE LINEAMENT MAP OF IRAN WAS PREPARED BY DATA INTEGRATION. THE ANALYSIS FOR SELECTING SIGNIFICANT LINEAMENT WAS MAINLY BASED ON FAULT CORRELATED LINEAMENT AND LINEAMENT WITH FIELD MAP FRACTURES, WHICH WAS SETS AS BENCHMARKS FOR COMPILING A FINAL OUTPUT MAP. FOUR MAJOR REGIONAL LINEAMENT TRENDS OF N S, E W, NW SE AND NE SW WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE DATA OF ALL IMAGES, WHICH ARE CORRESPONDED TO THE STRUCTURAL ZONES AND THE MAJOR FAULT SYSTEMS OF IRAN. THE MINERAL DEPOSITS (ACTIVE AND ABANDONED) AND MINERAL INDICATIONS DATABASE COMPILED ARE BASED ON THE PUBLISHED MAPS, PAPERS, REPORTS AND THE ORE DEPOSITS DATA FILES OF GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF IRAN. INTEGRATING THE OUTPUT OF THESE TWO DATASETS BY GIS SOFTWARE RESULTED IN THE COMBINED MAP OF LINEAMENTS AND GOLD, COPPER, LEAD, ZINC AND IRON DEPOSITS OF IRAN. THE NUMBER AND DISTANCE OF ORE DEPOSITS TOWARD THE LINEAMENTS WERE PROCESSED BY THE COUNTING AND CUMULATIVE METHODS IN THE GIS SOFTWARES. APPROXIMATELY, OVER 90% OF THE ORE DEPOSITS OF IRAN ARE LOCATED IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE LINEAMENTS (15 KM ON EACH SIDE) WHICH ARE CONCORDANT WITH A DEFINITION OF LARGE LINEAMENT. ABOUT 50% OF THESE MINERAL DEPOSITS ARE CLOSER THAN 5 KM TO THE LINEAMENTS. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN LINEAMENT DENSITY AND INTERSECTIONS WITH ORE DEPOSITS OCCURRENCES.

HOWEVER, THIS APPROACH IS LIMITED TO TEST AN HYPOTHESIS OF DISCRIMINATION OVER THE WHOLE DATASET UNDER ANALYSIS. OUR METHODOLOGY COUPLES DATA MINING, FOR UNVEILING PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN CONTEXTS OF POSSIBLE DISCRIMINATION, WITH STATISTICAL REGRESSION, FOR TESTING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SUCH CONTEXTS, THUS OBTAINING THE BEST OF THE TWO WORLDS.

AN INTEREST IN LEARNING AFFECTS LEARNING PRODUCTIVITY, WHILE PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS DEMONSTRATE SUCH CHANGES. SINCE THE RESEARCH BY THE AUTHORS OF THE PRESENT ARTICLE CONFIRMED THESE INTERDEPENDENCIES, A RECOMMENDER SYSTEM TO ANALYZE STUDENTS ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE (RECOMMENDER SYSTEM HEREAFTER) HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. THE RECOMMENDER SYSTEM DETERMINES THE LEVEL OF LEARNING PRODUCTIVITY INTEGRALLY BY EMPLOYING THREE MAIN TECHNIQUES (PHYSIOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL). THIS RECOMMENDER SYSTEM, DEVELOPED BY THESE AUTHORS, USES MOTIVATIONAL, EDUCATIONAL PERSISTENCE AND SOCIAL LEARNING THEORIES AND THE DATABASE OF BEST GLOBAL PRACTICES BASED ON ABOVE THEORIES TO COME UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STUDENTS ON HOW TO IMPROVE THEIR LEARNING EFFICIENCY. THE RECOMMENDER SYSTEM CAN PICK LEARNING MATERIALS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT A STUDENTS LEARNING PRODUCTIVITY AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH LEARNING IS INTERESTING. WORLDWIDE RESEARCH INCLUDES VARIOUS SCIENTISTS WHO CONDUCTED IN DEPTH STUDIES ON THE DIFFERENT AND VERY IMPORTANT AREAS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS. WE DID NOT MANAGE TO FIND ANY PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OR ANY INTELLIGENT OR INTEGRATED SYSTEM THAT WOULD TAKE PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS OF STUDENTS, ANALYZE THEIR LEARNING EFFICIENCY AND, IN TURN, PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS.

ONE WAY OF STUDYING THEM IS THE SEARCH OF COMMON METABOLIC CHARACTERISTICS AMONG MICROBIAL SPECIES, WHICH IS NOT ONLY A POTENTIAL MEASURE FOR THE DIFFERENTIATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF CLOSELY RELATED ORGANISMS BUT ALSO THEIR STUDY ALLOWS THE FINDING OF COMMON FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES THAT MAY DESCRIBE THE WAY OF LIFE OF ENTIRE ORGANISMS OR SPECIES. IN THIS WORK WE PROPOSE AN EXPERT SYSTEM (ES), MAKING THE MAIN CONTRIBUTION, TO CLUSTER A COMPLEX DATA SET OF 365 PROKARYOTIC SPECIES BY 114 METABOLIC FEATURES, INFORMATION WHICH MAY BE INCOMPLETE FOR SOME SPECIES. INSPIRED ON THE HUMAN EXPERT REASONING AND BASED ON HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING STRATEGIES, OUR PROPOSED ES ESTIMATES THE OPTIMAL NUMBER OF CLUSTERS ADEQUATE TO DIVIDE THE DATASET AND AFTERWARDS IT STARTS AN ITERATIVE PROCESS OF CLUSTERING, BASED ON THE SELF ORGANIZING MAPS (SOM) APPROACH, WHERE IT FINDS RELEVANT CLUSTERS AT DIFFERENT STEPS BY MEANS OF A NEW VALIDITY INDEX INSPIRED ON THE WELL KNOWN DAVIES BOULDIN (DB) INDEX. IN ORDER TO MONITOR THE PROCESS AND ASSESS THE BEHAVIOR OF THE ES THE PARTITION OBTAINED AT EACH STEP IS VALIDATED WITH THE DB VALIDITY INDEX. THE RESULTING CLUSTERS PROVE THAT THE USE OF METABOLIC FEATURES COMBINED WITH THE ES IS ABLE TO HANDLE A COMPLEX DATASET THAT CAN HELP IN THE EXTRACTION OF UNDERLYING INFORMATION, GAINING ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER EXISTING APPROACHES, THAT MAY RELATE METABOLISM WITH PHENOTYPIC, ENVIRONMENTAL OR EVOLUTIONARY CHARACTERISTICS IN PROKARYOTIC SPECIES.

IN CAD SYSTEMS, SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED THE USE OF WAVELET TRANSFORM AS A MULTIRESOLUTION ANALYSIS TOOL FOR TEXTURE ANALYSIS AND COULD BE INTERPRETED AS INPUTS TO A CLASSIFIER. IN CLASSIFICATION, POLYNOMIAL CLASSIFIER HAS BEEN USED DUE TO THE ADVANTAGES OF PROVIDING ONLY ONE MODEL FOR OPTIMAL SEPARATION OF CLASSES AND TO CONSIDER THIS AS THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM. IN THIS PAPER, A SYSTEM IS PROPOSED FOR TEXTURE ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION OF LESIONS IN MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGES. MULTIRESOLUTION ANALYSIS FEATURES WERE EXTRACTED FROM THE REGION OF INTEREST OF A GIVEN IMAGE. THESE FEATURES WERE COMPUTED BASED ON THREE DIFFERENT WAVELET FUNCTIONS, DAUBECHIES 8, SYMLET 8 AND BI ORTHOGONAL 3.7. FOR CLASSIFICATION, WE USED THE POLYNOMIAL CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM TO DEFINE THE MAMMOGRAM IMAGES AS NORMAL OR ABNORMAL. WE ALSO MADE A COMPARISON WITH OTHER ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ALGORITHMS (DECISION TREE, SVM, K NN). A RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS (ROC) CURVE IS USED TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM. OUR SYSTEM IS EVALUATED USING 360 DIGITIZED MAMMOGRAMS FROM DDSM DATABASE AND THE RESULT SHOWS THAT THE ALGORITHM HAS AN AREA UNDER THE ROC CURVE AZ OF 0.98 +/ 0.03. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE POLYNOMIAL CLASSIFIER HAS PROVED TO BE BETTER IN COMPARISON TO OTHER CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

HOWEVER, KDA ONLY CAPTURES GLOBAL GEOMETRICAL STRUCTURE AND DISREGARDS LOCAL GEOMETRICAL STRUCTURE OF THE DATA. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A NEW FEATURE EXTRACTION ALGORITHM, CALLED LOCALITY PRESERVING KDA (LPKDA) ALGORITHM. LPKDA FIRST CASTS KDA AS A LEAST SQUARES PROBLEM IN THE KERNEL SPACE AND THEN EXPLICITLY INCORPORATES THE LOCAL GEOMETRICAL STRUCTURE INFORMATION INTO THE LEAST SQUARES PROBLEM VIA REGULARIZATION TECHNIQUE. THE FACT THAT LPKDA CAN MAKE FULL USE OF TWO KINDS OF DISCRIMINANT INFORMATION, GLOBAL AND LOCAL, MAKES IT A MORE POWERFUL DISCRIMINATOR. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON FOUR IMAGE DATABASES SHOW THAT LPKDA OUTPERFORMS OTHER KERNEL BASED ALGORITHMS.	***

HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN REALISED THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF RAILWAY BRIDGES HAS NOT BEEN INTEGRATED INTO THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS, THE STANDARD GUIDELINE AND CRITERION IS STILL MISSING IN THIS FIELD. THEREFORE, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) METHOD IS INTRODUCED INTO RAILWAY BRIDGES. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A SYSTEMATIC BRIDGE LCA MODEL AS A GUIDELINE TO QUANTIFY THE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDENS FOR THE RAILWAY BRIDGE STRUCTURES. A COMPARISON CASE STUDY BETWEEN TWO ALTERNATIVE DESIGNS OF BANAFJAL BRIDGE IS FURTHER CARRIED OUT THROUGH THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLE, WITH THE CONSIDERATION OF SEVERAL KEY MAINTENANCE AND END OF LIFE SCENARIOS. SIX IMPACT CATEGORIES ARE INVESTIGATED BY USING THE LCA CML 2001 METHOD AND THE KNOWN LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY DATABASE. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE FIXED SLAB BRIDGE OPTION HAS A BETTER ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE THAN THE BALLASTED DESIGN DUE TO THE EASE OF MAINTENANCES. THE INITIAL MATERIAL MANUFACTURE STAGE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LARGEST ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN, WHILE THE IMPACTS FROM THE CONSTRUCTION MACHINERY AND MATERIAL TRANSPORTATIONS ARE IGNORABLE.

OF THE FOUR XBAL CLONES OF PV7037, ONE CLONE OF 17,577 BP HAS ALREADY BEEN SEQUENCED AND SHOWN TO CARRY A MULTI RESISTANCE GENE CLUSTER. THE REMAINING THREE CLONES OF APPROXIMATELY 12.5, 6.5 AND 4.5 KB WERE SEQUENCED, THE ENTIRE PLASMID SEQUENCE CORRECTLY ASSEMBLED AND INVESTIGATED FOR READING FRAMES. IN ADDITION, TWO READING FRAMES ONE CODING FOR AN ABC TRANSPORTER AND THE OTHER CODING FOR AN RRNA METHYLASE WERE CLONED AND EXPRESSED IN A S. AUREUS HOST TO SEE WHETHER THEY CONFER ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE PROPERTIES. PLASMID PV7037 PROVED TO BE 40,971 BP IN SIZE. BESIDES THE PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED RESISTANCE GENE CLUSTER, IT CARRIED A FUNCTIONALLY ACTIVE TET(L) GENE FOR TETRACYCLINE RESISTANCE, A COMPLETE CADDX OPERON FOR CADMIUM RESISTANCE AND ALSO A VARIANT OF THE BETA LACTAMASE TRANSPOSON TN552. TWO SINGLE BP DELETIONS, WHICH RESULTED IN FRAME SHIFTS, FUNCTIONALLY DELETED THE GENES FOR THE BLAZ BETA LACTAMASE AND THE SIGNAL TRANSDUCER PROTEIN BLAR1 IN THIS TN552 VARIANT OF PV7037. PLASMID PV7037 SEEMS TO BE COMPOSED OF VARIOUS PARTS PREVIOUSLY KNOWN FROM PLASMIDS AND TRANSPOSONS OF STAPHYLOCOCCI AND OTHER GRAM POSITIVE BACTERIA. HOWEVER, THERE ARE ALSO PARTS OF THE PLASMID WHICH DO NOT SHOW ANY HOMOLOGY TO SO FAR KNOWN SEQUENCES DEPOSITED IN THE DATABASES. THE NOVEL ABC TRANSPORTER AND RRNA METHYLASE GENES IDENTIFIED ON PV7037 DO NOT SEEM TO PLAY A ROLE IN ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE. THE CO LOCATION OF NUMEROUS ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE GENES BEARS THE RISK OF CO TRANSFER AND CO SELECTION OF RESISTANCE GENES, BUT ALSO PERSISTENCE OF RESISTANCE GENES EVEN IF NO DIRECT SELECTIVE PRESSURE BY THE USE OF THE RESPECTIVE ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS IS APPLIED.

THIS STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT TO EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OPTICAL DENSITY RATIO (ODR) MEASURED ON BULK TANK MILK WITH AN INDIRECT OSTERTAGIA OSTERTAGI ELISA AND REPRODUCTION/MORTALITY PARAMETERS. DATA WERE COLLECTED BETWEEN 2008 AND 2010 FROM MONITORING CARRIED OUT ON 1643 DAIRY HERDS (NORMANDY, WESTERN FRANCE). ODR VALUES OF 3 SAMPLES FROM EACH FARM TAKEN FROM NOVEMBER 2008 TO 2010 WERE AVERAGED AND THEN TRANSFORMED INTO A CATEGORICAL VARIABLE. REPRODUCTIVE AND MORTALITY DATA WERE OBTAINED FROM 1444 HERDS USING COW RECORDS FROM GOVERNMENT DATABASES. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT USING ORDINARY LOGISTIC REGRESSION (OLR). THE OUTCOME VARIABLES WERE THE CASE CONTROL STATUS OF A HERD FOR REPRODUCTIVE FACTORS, AGE AT FIRST CALVING AND INTER CALVING INTERVALS, AND MORTALITY RATIOS OF VARIOUS AGE CLASSES. THE EFFECT OF THE CATEGORICAL ODR VARIABLE WAS STUDIED AND SEVERAL POTENTIAL CONFOUNDER HERD FACTORS WERE USED TO IMPROVE THE MODEL FIT. A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP WAS FOUND BETWEEN HIGH OSTERTAGIA ODR LEVELS AND A LATE AGE AT THE FIRST CALVING (>34.5 MONTHS) (ODDS RATIO (OR) 1.94, P < 0.001). NO SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP WAS OBSERVED WITH OLR FOR INTER CALVING INTERVALS ALTHOUGH BIVARIATE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT HERDS WITH HIGH ODR LEVELS HAD LONGER INTER CALVING INTERVALS THAN HERDS WITH LOW ODR LEVEL (FIRST INTER CALVING INTERVAL IN HERDS WITH LOW VS.

NO SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP WAS OBSERVED WITH MULTIVARIATE APPROACH FOR MORTALITIES IN OTHER CLASSES BY AGE, BUT BIVARIATE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT HERDS WITH HIGH ODR LEVEL HAD HIGHER MORTALITIES THAN HERDS WITH LOW ODR LEVELS (MORTALITY BETWEEN 31 AND 90 DAYS IN HERDS WITH LOW VS. HIGH ODR LEVELS 1.89% VS. 2.91%, P < 0.001; MORTALITY AFTET 365 DAYS 1.67% VS. 2.93%, P < 0.001). IN CONCLUSION, OUR RESULTS CONFIRM THE USEFULNESS OF ELISA AS AN INDICATOR FOR PRODUCTION LOSSES IN DAIRY HERDS.

OVER THE YEARS, STANDARD AND VARIATIONS OF THE ENTITY RELATIONSHIP (ER) MODEL HAS WIDESPREAD USE, AND ALSO SOME APPROACHES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED FOR MODELING FUZZY INFORMATION IN ER AND EXTENDED ENTITY RELATIONSHIP (EER) MODELS. THEREFORE,CONSTRUCTING FUZZY ONTOLOGIES FROM FUZZY EER MODELS MAY BE VALUABLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUZZY ONTOLOGIES, AND IN TURN THE CONSTRUCTED FUZZY ONTOLOGIES MAY BE USEFUL FOR REASONING ABOUT THE FUZZY EER MODELS. IN THIS PAPER, WE DEVELOP A SEMANTICS PRESERVING APPROACH AND AN AUTOMATED TOOL FOR CONSTRUCTING FUZZY ONTOLOGIES FROM FUZZY EER MODELS, AND INVESTIGATE HOW TO APPLY THE CONSTRUCTED FUZZY ONTOLOGIES TO REASON ON FUZZY EER MODELS. THE CONSTRUCTED FUZZY ONTOLOGIES ARE REPRESENTED BY THE FUZZY OWL LANGUAGE, WHICH IS A FUZZY EXTENSION OF THE W3C RECOMMENDATION STANDARD ONTOLOGY LANGUAGE OWL (WEB ONTOLOGY LANGUAGE). FIRSTLY, WE GIVE THE FORMALIZATION OF FUZZY EER MODELS. ON THIS BASIS, WE PROPOSE AN APPROACH FOR CONSTRUCTING FUZZY OWL ONTOLOGIES FROM FUZZY EER MODELS, WHICH CAN TRANSFORM FUZZY EER MODELS (INCLUDING THE STRUCTURE AND INSTANCE INFORMATION OF FUZZY EER MODELS) INTO FUZZY OWL ONTOLOGIES.

HOWEVER, THERE IS NO METHOD THAT COULD GENERATE OPTIMAL BINDING SITE PREDICTION FOR DIFFERENT PROTEIN TYPES. COMBINATION OF COMPLEMENTARY PREDICTIONS IS PROBABLY THE MOST RELIABLE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. RESULTS: WE DEVELOP TWO NEW METHODS, ONE BASED ON BINDING SPECIFIC SUBSTRUCTURE COMPARISON (TM SITE) AND ANOTHER ON SEQUENCE PROFILE ALIGNMENT (S SITE), FOR COMPLEMENTARY BINDING SITE PREDICTIONS. THE METHODS ARE TESTED ON A SET OF 500 NON REDUNDANT PROTEINS HARBORING 814 NATURAL, DRUG LIKE AND METAL ION MOLECULES. STARTING FROM LOW RESOLUTION PROTEIN STRUCTURE PREDICTIONS, THE METHODS SUCCESSFULLY RECOGNIZE >51% OF BINDING RESIDUES WITH AVERAGE MATTHEWS CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (MCC) SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER (WITH P VALUE >10( 9) IN STUDENT T TEST) THAN OTHER STATE OF THE ART METHODS, INCLUDING COFACTOR, FINDSITE AND CONCAVITY. WHEN COMBINING TM SITE AND S SITE WITH OTHER STRUCTURE BASED PROGRAMS, A CONSENSUS APPROACH (COACH) CAN INCREASE MCC BY 15% OVER THE BEST INDIVIDUAL PREDICTIONS. COACH WAS EXAMINED IN THE RECENT COMMUNITY WIDE COMEO EXPERIMENT AND CONSISTENTLY RANKED AS THE BEST METHOD IN LAST 22 INDIVIDUAL DATASETS WITH THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE SCORE 22.5% HIGHER THAN THE SECOND BEST METHOD. THESE DATA DEMONSTRATE A NEW ROBUST APPROACH TO PROTEIN LIGAND BINDING SITE RECOGNITION, WHICH IS READY FOR GENOME WIDE STRUCTURE BASED FUNCTION ANNOTATIONS.	***

THEREFORE, MUTATIONS AND DYSREGULATIONS OF THESE LNCRNAS WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF VARIOUS COMPLEX DISEASES. DEVELOPING POWERFUL COMPUTATIONAL MODELS FOR POTENTIAL DISEASE RELATED LNCRNAS IDENTIFICATION WOULD BENEFIT BIOMARKER IDENTIFICATION AND DRUG DISCOVERY FOR HUMAN DISEASE DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, PROGNOSIS AND PREVENTION. RESULTS: IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PROPOSED THE ASSUMPTION THAT SIMILAR DISEASES TEND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH FUNCTIONALLY SIMILAR LNCRNAS. THEN, WE FURTHER DEVELOPED THE METHOD OF LAPLACIAN REGULARIZED LEAST SQUARES FOR LNCRNA DISEASE ASSOCIATION (LRLSLDA) IN THE SEMISUPERVISED LEARNING FRAMEWORK. ALTHOUGH KNOWN DISEASE LNCRNA ASSOCIATIONS IN THE DATABASE ARE RARE, LRLSLDA STILL OBTAINED AN AUC OF 0.7760 IN THE LEAVE ONE OUT CROSS VALIDATION, SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF PREVIOUS METHODS. WE ALSO ILLUSTRATED THE PERFORMANCE OF LRLSLDA IS NOT SENSITIVE (EVEN ROBUST) TO THE PARAMETERS SELECTION AND IT CAN OBTAIN A RELIABLE PERFORMANCE IN ALL THE TEST CLASSES. PLENTY OF POTENTIAL DISEASE LNCRNA ASSOCIATIONS WERE PUBLICLY RELEASED AND SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED BY RECENT RESULTS IN BIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS.

FROM MANY YEARS OF INTENSIVE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH, A LARGE BODY OF BIOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE, OR PATHWAY INFORMATION, HAS ACCUMULATED IN AVAILABLE DATABASES. THERE IS A STRONG INTEREST IN LEVERAGING THESE PATHWAYS TO IMPROVE THE STATISTICAL POWER AND INTERPRETABILITY IN STUDYING GENE NETWORKS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLEX PHENOTYPES. THIS PRIOR INFORMATION IS A VALUABLE COMPLEMENT TO LARGE SCALE GENOMIC DATA SUCH AS GENE EXPRESSION DATA GENERATED FROM MICROARRAYS. HOWEVER, IT IS A NON TRIVIAL TASK TO EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE AVAILABLE BIOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE INTO GENE EXPRESSION DATA WHEN RECONSTRUCTING GENE NETWORKS. RESULTS: IN THIS ARTICLE, WE DEVELOPED AND APPLIED A LASSO METHOD FROM A BAYESIAN PERSPECTIVE, A METHOD WE CALL PRIOR LASSO (PLASSO), FOR THE RECONSTRUCTION OF GENE NETWORKS. IN THIS METHOD, WE PARTITION EDGES BETWEEN GENES INTO TWO SUBSETS: ONE SUBSET OF EDGES IS PRESENT IN KNOWN PATHWAYS, WHEREAS THE OTHER HAS NO PRIOR INFORMATION ASSOCIATED. OUR METHOD ASSIGNS DIFFERENT PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS TO EACH SUBSET ACCORDING TO A MODIFIED BAYESIAN INFORMATION CRITERION THAT INCORPORATES PRIOR KNOWLEDGE ON BOTH THE NETWORK STRUCTURE AND THE PATHWAY INFORMATION. SIMULATION STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT THE METHOD IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN RECOVERING THE UNDERLYING NETWORK THAN A TRADITIONAL LASSO METHOD THAT DOES NOT USE THE PRIOR INFORMATION. WE APPLIED PLASSO TO MICROARRAY GENE EXPRESSION DATASETS, WHERE WE USED INFORMATION FROM THE PATHWAY COMMONS (PC) AND THE KYOTO ENCYCLOPEDIA OF GENES AND GENOMES (KEGG) AS PRIOR INFORMATION FOR THE NETWORK RECONSTRUCTION, AND SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFIED NETWORK HUB GENES ASSOCIATED WITH CLINICAL OUTCOME IN CANCER PATIENTS.	***

THIRTY FOUR STUDIES FULFILLED THE INCLUSION CRITERIA AND DATA WERE POOLED FOR ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THE POOLED ESTIMATES FOR K RAS MUTATION IN DIAGNOSIS OF PANCREATIC CARCINOMA WERE AS FOLLOWS: SENSITIVITY 0.68 (95% CI: 0.66 0.71), SPECIFICITY 0.87 (95% CI: 0.85 0.88), POSITIVE LIKELIHOOD RATIO 4.54 (95% CI: 3.47 5.94), NEGATIVE LIKELIHOOD RATIO 0.37 (95% CI: 0.30 0.44) AND DIAGNOSTIC ODDS RATIO 14.90 (95% CI: 10.02 22.15). SUMMARY RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE MAXIMUM JOINT SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY WAS 0.79, AND THE OVERALL AREA UNDER THE CURVE WAS 0.86. CONCLUSIONS: DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY OF K RAS MUTATION WAS NOT SUPERIOR TO THAT OF CONVENTIONAL TESTS.

LDLT IS THOUGHT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER RATES OF BILIARY COMPLICATIONS, BUT THERE ARE FEW STUDIES COMPARING THE SUCCESS OF ENDOSCOPIC MANAGEMENT OF ANASTOMOTIC STRICTURES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. THIS STUDY AIMS TO COMPARE OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE ENDOSCOPIC MANAGEMENT OF ANASTOMOTIC STRICTURES IN DDLT VERSUS LDLT. METHODS: THIS IS A RETROSPECTIVE DATABASE REVIEW OF ALL LIVER TRANSPLANT PATIENTS UNDERGOING ENDOSCOPIC RETROGRADE CHOLANGIOPANCREATOGRAPHY (ERCP) AFTER LIVER TRANSPLANTATION. THE FREQUENCY OF ANASTOMOTIC STRICTURE AND THE TIME TO DEVELOP AND TO RESOLVE ANASTOMOTIC STRICTURE WERE COMPARED BETWEEN DDLT AND LDLT. THE RESPONSE OF ANASTOMOTIC STRICTURE TO ENDOSCOPIC THERAPY WAS ALSO ANALYZED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 362 PATIENTS UNDERWENT LIVER TRANSPLANTATION BETWEEN 2003 AND 2011, WITH 125 REQUIRING ERCP TO MANAGE BILIARY COMPLICATIONS. THIRTY THREE (9.9%) CASES OF DDLT AND 8 (27.6%) OF LDLT (P0.01) WERE FOUND TO HAVE ANASTOMOTIC STRICTURE. WHEN COMPARING DDLT AND LDLT, THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN TIME TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANASTOMOTIC STRICTURES (98 +/ 17 VS 172 +/ 65 DAYS, P0.11), LIKELIHOOD OF RESPONSE TO ERCP [22(66.7%) VS 6 (75.0%), P0.69], MEAN TIME TO THE RESOLUTION OF ANASTOMOTIC STRICTURES (268 +/ 77 VS 125 +/ 37 DAYS, P0.34), AND THE NUMBER OF ERCPS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE RESOLUTION (3.9 +/ 0.4 VS 4.7 +/ 0.9, P0.38). CONCLUSIONS: ENDOSCOPIC THERAPY IS EFFECTIVE IN THE MAJORITY OF BINARY COMPLICATIONS RELATING TO LIVER TRANSPLANTATION. ANASTOMOTIC STRICTURES OCCUR MORE FREQUENTLY IN LDLT COMPARED WITH DDLT, WITH EQUIVALENT ENDOSCOPIC TREATMENT RESPONSE AND OUTCOMES FOR BOTH GROUPS.	***

CURRENTLY, MANY LIVER TRANSPLANT CENTERS, ESPECIALLY IN WESTERN COUNTRIES, USE THE MILAN OR UCSF CRITERIA TO SELECT PATIENTS WITH HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA FOR LIVER TRANSPLANTATION. THIS STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO COMPARE THE HBV PROPHYLACTIC OUTCOMES IN TWO GROUPS OF LIVING DONOR LIVER TRANSPLANTATION (LDLT) RECIPIENTS. PATIENTS IN GROUP A MET THE MILAN CRITERIA AND THOSE IN GROUP B EXCEEDED THE MILAN CRITERIA BUT WERE WITHIN THE UCSF CRITERIA. METHODS: A DATABASE OF ADULT TO ADULT RIGHT LOBE LDLT PERFORMED AT OUR INSTITUTION FOR HBV RELATED HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA WITHIN THE MILAN OR UCSF CRITERIA BETWEEN JUNE 2002 AND MAY 2012 WAS USED TO COMPARE THE HBV PROPHYLACTIC OUTCOMES BETWEEN PATIENTS WITHIN THE MILAN CRITERIA (GROUP A, 41 PATIENTS) AND THOSE EXCEEDING THE MILAN CRITERIA BUT WITHIN THE UCSF CRITERIA (GROUP B, 19 PATIENTS). RESULTS: THE 1 , 3 , AND 5 YEAR SURVIVAL RATES WERE SIMILAR BETWEEN GROUPS A AND B (87.8%, 85.1% AND 74.0% VS 73.3%, 61.1% AND 61.1%, RESPECTIVELY, P0.067). HBV RECURRED IN 1 PATIENT IN 3.1 MONTHS AFTER LDLT IN GROUP A AND IN 2 PATIENTS IN GROUP B (1 IN 11.9 MONTHS AND 1 IN 24.1 MONTHS AFTER LDLT). THE 1 , 3 , AND 5 YEAR HBV RECURRENCE RATES WERE 2.6%, 2.6% AND 2.6% IN GROUP A, AND 7.3%, 17.9% AND 17.9% IN GROUP B, RESPECTIVELY (P0.118). CONCLUSION: LDLT RECIPIENTS WHO EXCEED THE MILAN CRITERIA BUT REMAIN WITHIN THE UCSF CRITERIA MAY HAVE POST TRANSPLANT HBV PROPHYLACTIC OUTCOMES SIMILAR TO THOSE WHO MEET THE MILAN CRITERIA.	***

ALTHOUGH IT IS ACCEPTED THAT MS IS A MULTIFACTORIAL DISORDER WITH BOTH GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS INFLUENCING ITS DEVELOPMENT AND COURSE, THE MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS OF MS HAS NOT YET BEEN FULLY ELUCIDATED. HERE, WE STUDIED THE LONGITUDINAL GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES OF WHOLE BLOOD RNA FROM A COHORT OF 195 MS PATIENTS AND 66 HEALTHY CONTROLS. WE ANALYZED THESE TRANSCRIPTOMES AT BOTH THE INDIVIDUAL TRANSCRIPT AND THE BIOLOGICAL PATHWAY LEVEL. WE FOUND 62 TRANSCRIPTS TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY UP REGULATED IN MS PATIENTS; THE EXPRESSION OF 11 OF THESE GENES WAS COUNTER REGULATED BY INTERFERON TREATMENT, SUGGESTING PARTIAL RESTORATION OF A HEALTHY GENE EXPRESSION PROFILE. GLOBAL PATHWAY ANALYSES LINKED THE PROTEASOME AND WNT SIGNALING TO MS DISEASE PROCESSES. SINCE GENOTYPES FROM A SUBSET OF INDIVIDUALS WERE AVAILABLE, WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY EXPRESSION QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI (EQTL), A NUMBER OF WHICH INVOLVED TWO GENES OF THE MS GENE SIGNATURE. HOWEVER, ALL THESE EQTL WERE ALSO PRESENT IN HEALTHY CONTROLS.

METHODS: WE SEARCHED ONLINE DATABASES: CHINESE JOURNAL FULL TEXT DATABASE, CHINA NATIONAL KNOWLEDGE INFRASTRUCTURE, WANFANG DATABASE, CHINESE JOURNAL FULL TEXT DATABASE, PUBMED, SCIENCEDIRECT, EMBASE, AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY WITH MANUAL SCREENING OF RELEVANT LITERATURE. ELIGIBLE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCT) ON ANGINA PECTORIS WERE INCLUDED. WE CONDUCTED META ANALYSIS USING THE REVMAN 5.1 SOFTWARE FROM THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION. WE TREATED THE RELIEF RATE OF ANGINA SYMPTOMS AND ELECTROCARDIOGRAPH (ECG) AS EVALUATION. RESULTS: SEVEN ARTICLES, INCLUDING IN 1134 PATIENTS, WERE ENROLLED AFTER THE EVALUATION. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT HETEROGENEITY AMONG THE STUDIES (CHI(2)1.08, DF6, P0.98, I 20%). THE SAFFLOWER YELLOW INJECTION WITH CONVENTIONAL THERAPY HAS A HIGHER EFFECTIVE RATE THAN THE CONTROL GROUP IN RELIEVING THE SYMPTOMS OF ANGINA PECTORIS [ODDS RATIO (OR)2.95, 95% (CI) (1.81, 4.81)] AND IMPROVING ISCHEMIC ECG [OR2.85, 95% CI (1.67, 4.86)]. THE DIFFERENCE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE 80 MG DOSAGE AND 100 MG DOSAGE SUBGROUPS (P<0.05) FOR IMPROVING CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND ECG. THE FUNNEL GRAPHIC WAS NEARLY SYMMETRICAL. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS SUGGESTED THAT THE RESULTS WERE STABLE. CONCLUSION: SAFFLOWER YELLOW INJECTION AS AN ADJUNCT THERAPY WITH CONVENTIONAL DRUGS SHOWS ADVANTAGES IN EASING THE CLINICAL SYMPTOMS OF UNSTABLE ANGINA AND IMPROVING ECG OVER BASIC THERAPY ALONE. HOWEVER, THE CONCLUSIONS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CARE UNTIL MORE HIGH QUALITY RCTS ARE REPORTED. (C) 2013 JTCM. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

METHODS: WE STUDIED 191 PATIENTS WITH STABLE COPD (ACCORDING TO DEFINED CRITERIA) IN THIS CROSS SECTIONAL STUDY FROM FOUR THREE LEVEL CLASS A CHINESE MEDICINE HOSPITALS IN CHINA. WE BUILT AN EPIDATA 3.0 DATABASE AND PERFORMED STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WITH SPSS, VERSION 17.0. WE ANALYZED CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE FREQUENCY OF LOWER GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT SYMPTOMS (CONSTIPATION AND ABDOMINAL DISTENTION) AND SCORES FOR MAJOR PULMONARY SYMPTOMS (COUGH, SPUTUM AND WHEEZING) BASED ON THE ST. GEORGES RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE (SGRQ), 6 MINUTE WALKING DISTANCE (6MWD) AND FREQUENCY OF ACUTE EXACERBATIONS OF COPD (AECOPD). RESULTS: IN ADDITION TO THEIR PULMONARY SYMPTOMS, 39.79% AND 40.31% OF STUDY PATIENTS WITH STABLE COPD REPORTED CONSTIPATION AND ABDOMINAL DISTENTION, RESPECTIVELY. SCORES FOR MAJOR PULMONARY SYMPTOMS (COUGH, SPUTUM AND WHEEZING), AECOPD AND SGRQ VALUES IN PATIENTS WITH CONSTIPATION AND ABDOMINAL DISTENTION WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER, AND THE 6MWD MARKEDLY SHORTER, THAN IN THOSE WITHOUT THEM. ACCORDING TO PEARSONS CORRELATION ANALYSIS, THERE WERE STRONG CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THESE LOWER GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT SYMPTOMS AND SCORES FOR PULMONARY SYMPTOMS, SGRQ, 6MWD AND AECOPD. CONCLUSION: LOWER GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT SYMPTOMS SUCH AS CONSTIPATION AND ABDOMINAL DISTENTION CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT PULMONARY SYMPTOMS, FREQUENCY OF ACUTE EXACERBATIONS AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH STABLE COPD.

INFLUENZA AFFECTS HOST SUSCEPTIBILITY TO PNEUMOCOCCUS. WE SOUGHT TO EVALUATE WHETHER THIS RELATIONSHIP VARIES BY PNEUMOCOCCAL SEROTYPE USING A LARGE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATABASE COVERING 3 DECADES. METHODS. WEEKLY RATES OF INVASIVE PNEUMOCOCCAL PNEUMONIA (IPP) WERE OBTAINED FROM THE DANISH NATIONAL LABORATORY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM, AND INFLUENZA LIKE ILLNESS (ILI) DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM DANISH SENTINEL SURVEILLANCE, STATENS SERUM INSTITUT, 1977 2007. WE FIT POISSON REGRESSION MODELS FOR EACH AGE AND COMORBIDITY GROUP, WITH PREDICTORS FOR SEASONALITY AND SECULAR CHANGES, ILI ACTIVITY, AND SEROTYPE. RESULTS. AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH LOW LEVELS OF COMORBIDITIES, INFLUENZA HAD THE LARGEST IMPACT ON IPP INCIDENCE AMONG LOW INVASIVENESS SEROTYPES (INFLUENZA ATTRIBUTABLE PERCENT: 17.9%, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 13.6 21.9) AS COMPARED WITH HIGH INVASIVENESS SEROTYPES (6.7%, 95% CI, 3.8% 11.7%).

THE EDDY COVARIANCE AND ANCILLARY DATA WERE TAKEN FROM THE CARBOEUROPE AND FLUXNET DATABASES AND A LINEAR MODELING STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS MADE. THE FOUR SITES WERE A HIGH DENSITY POPLAR (POPULUS SPP.) SHORT ROTATION COPPICE PLANTATION (IN LOCHRISTI, BELGIUM) AND A MATURE SCOTS PINE (PINUS SYLVESTRIS) FOREST (IN BRASSCHAAT, BELGIUM) IN THE TEMPERATE CLIMATE VERSUS A FAST GROWING EUCALYPT (EUCALYPTUS) PLANTATION (IN ESPIRRA, PORTUGAL) AND A HOLM OAK (QUERCUS ILEX) FOREST (IN PUECHABON, FRANCE) IN THE MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE. THE EUCALYPT STAND SHOWED AN EFFICIENT STOMATAL CONTROL IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN VAPOR PRESSURE DEFICIT (VPD), SUGGESTING AN IDEAL ADAPTATION OF THIS SPECIES TO THE SEVERE MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE. THE FAST GROWING POPLAR STAND DID NOT SHOW A SIMILAR STOMATAL CONTROL UNDER CONDITIONS OF MODERATE WATER STRESS. BUT DURING AN INTENSIVE DRY PERIOD A DECREASE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LEAF AREA INDEX (LAI) WAS OBSERVED. THE HOLM OAK STAND SHOWED A LOW GPP, WHICH IS TYPICAL FOR A LOW PRODUCTIVE SPECIES WITH A LONG ROTATION CYCLE. THE GPP SHOWED LOW DIURNAL VARIABILITY, EVEN UNDER HIGH SOLAR RADIATION. THIS BEHAVIOR SUGGESTED A STRONG STOMATAL CONTROL CAUSED BY THE SEVERE WATER STRESS, A MECHANISM THAT ALLOWED THIS STAND TO COPE WITH DIURNAL AND SEASONAL WATER DEFICITS. THE MATURE SCOTS PINE FOREST IN THE TEMPERATE CLIMATE SHOWED NO VARIATION IN THE GPP RADIATION RELATIONSHIP. IN THIS FOREST NO WATER STRESS WAS OBSERVED, PROBABLY BECAUSE THE TREES ALWAYS HAD ACCESS TO THE WATER TABLE. IRRESPECTIVE OF THE CLIMATE THE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION OF THE SCOTS PINE FOREST PRESENTED A TIGHT COUPLING WITH THE ATMOSPHERE, I.E. A LOW DECOUPLING FACTOR, OMEGA, COMPARABLE WITH THE HOLM OAK AND THE EUCALYPT FORESTS. THE HIGH OMEGA VALUES OF THE YOUNG POPLAR PLANTATION WERE NOT TYPICAL FOR FOREST CANOPIES. THESE VALUES CONFIRMED THE STRONG INFLUENCE OF SOLAR RADIATION AND AVAILABLE ENERGY ON EVAPOTRANSPIRATION AND ON THE DYNAMICS OF THIS FAST DEVELOPING CANOPY. AT ALL FOUR SITES THE FORESTS SHOWED THEIR CAPACITY TO REACT TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS, CHARACTERISTIC FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE CLIMATIC TYPES. HOWEVER, DRASTIC CLIMATIC CHANGES SUCH AS HEAT WAVES OR LONG DROUGHT SPELLS MAY COMPROMISE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF FAST GROWING PLANTATIONS SUCH AS THE EUCALYPT AND POPLAR STANDS. THE RESPONSE OF THE POPLARS TO THESE EVENTS IS MAINLY ACHIEVED THROUGH LAI CONTROL IN CONTRAST TO THE STOMATAL CONTROL IN THE EUCALYPTS. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

TO STUDY THE STATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF PROFIT RATES, I USED DATA FROM A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATABASE FOR THE US ECONOMY FOR 2009 2010 (RISK MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION). FOR EACH OF THREE PROFIT RATE MEASURES, THE SAMPLE SPACE CONSISTS OF 771 POINTS. EACH POINT REPRESENTS AGGREGATE DATA FROM A SMALL NUMBER OF US MANUFACTURING FIRMS OF SIMILAR SIZE AND TYPE (NAICS CODE OF PRINCIPAL PRODUCT). WHEN COMPARING THE EMPIRICAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF PROFIT RATES, SIGNIFICANT HEAVY TAILS WERE OBSERVED, CORRESPONDING PRINCIPALLY TO A NUMBER OF FIRMS WITH LARGER PROFIT RATES THAN WOULD BE EXPECTED FROM SIMPLE MODELS. AN APPARENTLY NOVEL CORRELATED SUM OF RANDOM VARIABLES STATISTICAL MODEL WAS USED TO MODEL THE DATA. IN THE CASE OF OPERATING AND NET PROFIT RATES, A NUMBER OF FIRMS SHOW NEGATIVE PROFITS (LOSSES), RULING OUT SIMPLE GAMMA OR LOGNORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS AS COMPLETE MODELS FOR THESE DATA.

INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT MODELS ARE USED TO CALCULATE THE IMPACT OF ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS VIA THE COUPLING OF TECHNOECONOMIC AND EARTH/ATMOSPHERIC SYSTEM MODELS AND THEY HAVE OFTEN OVERLOOKED OR OVERSIMPLIFIED THE EVOLUTION OF LAND COVER CHANGE. DIFFERENT TIME SCALES AND THE UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN LONG TERM PROJECTIONS OF LAND COVER MAKE THEIR COUPLING TO INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT MODELS DIFFICULT. THE MAINSTREAM APPROACH TO LAND COVER MODELLING IS RULE BASED METHODOLOGY AND THIS NECESSARILY IMPLIES THAT DECISION MECHANISMS ARE OFTEN REMOVED FROM THE PHYSICAL GEOSPATIAL REALITIES, THEREFORE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS REMAIN: HOW MUCH OF THE PREDICTIVE POWER OF LAND COVER CHANGE CAN BE LINKED TO THE PHYSICAL SITUATION AS OPPOSED TO SOCIAL AND POLICY REALITIES? CAN LAND COVER CHANGE BE UNDERSTOOD USING A STATISTICAL APPROACH THAT INCLUDES ONLY ECONOMIC DRIVERS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES? IN THIS PAPER, WE USE AN ENERGY TRANSITION PARADIGM AS A MEANS TO PREDICT THIS CHANGE. A COST FUNCTION IS APPLIED TO DEVELOPED LAND COVERS FOR URBAN AND AGRICULTURAL AREAS. THE COUNTING OF AREA IS ADDRESSED USING SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF A POLYA PROCESS INVOLVING MAXWELL BOLTZMANN AND BOSE EINSTEIN STATISTICS. WE APPLY AN ITERATIVE COUNTING METHOD AND COMPARE THE SIMULATED STATISTICS WITH FRACTIONAL LAND COVER DATA WITH A MULTI NATIONAL DATABASE. AN ENERGY LEVEL PARADIGM IS USED AS A BASIS IN A FLOW MODEL FOR LAND COVER CHANGE. THE MODEL IS COMPARED WITH TABULATED LAND COVER CHANGE IN EUROPE FOR THE PERIOD 1990 2000. THE MODEL POST PREDICTS CHANGES FOR EACH NATION. WHEN STRONG EXTRANEOUS FACTORS ARE ABSENT, THE MODEL SHOWS PROMISE IN REPRODUCING DATA AND CAN PROVIDE A MEANS TO TEST HYPOTHESIS FOR THE STANDARD RULES BASED ALGORITHMS. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER B.V.

TO QUANTITATIVELY ASSESS THIS ASSOCIATION, WE HAVE CONDUCTED A META ANALYSIS OF PROSPECTIVE STUDIES. DATABASES AND REFERENCE LISTS OF RELEVANT STUDIES WERE SEARCHED USING MEDLINE AND EMBASE UP TO JANUARY 2013. POOLED RELATIVE RISKS (RRS) WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) WERE CALCULATED USING RANDOM EFFECTS MODELS. FOR THIS META ANALYSIS, A TOTAL OF SEVEN PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDIES WERE INCLUDED. THE ANALYSIS INCLUDED 5,299 PATIENTS FOR PREDIAGNOSIS PA AND 6,348 PATIENTS FOR POSTDIAGNOSIS PA, FOLLOWED UP OVER A PERIOD RANGING FROM 3.8 TO 11.9 YEARS. THE ANALYSES SHOWED THAT PATIENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN ANY AMOUNT OF PA BEFORE DIAGNOSIS HAD A RR OF 0.75 (95% CI: 0.65 0.87, P < 0.001) FOR COLORECTAL CANCER SPECIFIC MORTALITY COMPARED TO PATIENTS WHO DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN ANY PA. THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN HIGH PA BEFORE DIAGNOSIS (VS. LOW PA) HAD A RR OF 0.70 (95% CI: 0.56 0.87, P 0.002). SIMILARLY, PATIENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN ANY PA AFTER DIAGNOSIS HAD A RR OF 0.74 (95% CI: 0.58 0.95, P 0.02) FOR COLORECTAL CANCER SPECIFIC MORTALITY COMPARED TO PATIENTS WHO DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN ANY PA. THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN HIGH PA AFTER DIAGNOSIS (VS. LOW PA) HAD A RR OF 0.65 (95% CI: 0.47 0.92, P 0.01). SIMILAR INVERSE ASSOCIATIONS OF PREDIAGNOSIS OR POSTDIAGNOSIS PA WERE FOUND FOR ALL CAUSE MORTALITY. IN CONCLUSION, BOTH PREDIAGNOSIS AND POSTDIAGNOSIS PA WERE ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED COLORECTAL CANCER SPECIFIC MORTALITY AND ALL CAUSE MORTALITY. WHATS NEW? EVERYONE KNOWS EXERCISE IS GOOD FOR YOU, AND ITS BEEN SHOWN THAT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY REDUCES THE RISK OF DEVELOPING COLORECTAL CANCER. A NEW STUDY INVESTIGATED WHAT IMPACT EXERCISE HAS ON COLORECTAL CANCER OUTCOMES. THE AUTHORS INCLUDED A LARGE SAMPLE SIZE FROM SEVEN PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDIES AND COMPARED LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEFORE AND AFTER DIAGNOSIS WITH MORTALITY FROM ALL CAUSES AFTER DIAGNOSIS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER. THEY FOUND THAT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, UNDERTAKEN EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER DIAGNOSIS, REDUCES COLON CANCER MORTALITY.	***

WHILE BOTH TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN USED IN NON HUMAN PRIMATES ONLY DIFFUSION MRI CAN BE USED IN HUMAN. THE ADVANTAGE OF AXONAL TRACT TRACING IS THAT UNLIKE DIFFUSION MRI IT HAS A HIGH SINGLE CELL RESOLUTION, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY GIVES THE LAMINAR ORIGINS AND TERMINATIONS OF INTER AREAL PATHWAYS. IT, THEREFORE, CAN BE USED TO OBTAIN THE WEIGHTED AND DIRECTED CORTICAL GRAPH. AXONAL TRACT TRACING HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN COLLATED FROM MULTIPLE EXPERIMENTS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE LARGE SCALE INTER AREAL NETWORK. COLLATED DATA OF THIS KIND PRESENT NUMEROUS PROBLEMS DUE TO LACK OF COHERENCE ACROSS STUDIES AND INCOMPLETE EXPLOITATION. WE HAVE THEREFORE DEVELOPED A CONSISTENT DATA BASE WHICH USES STANDARDIZED EXPERIMENTAL AND PARCELLATION PROCEDURES ACROSS BRAINS. HERE WE REVIEW OUR RECENT PUBLICATIONS ANALYZING THE CONSISTENT DATABASE OBTAINED FROM RETROGRADE TRACER INJECTIONS IN 29 CORTICAL AREAS IN A PARCELLATION OF 91 AREAS OF THE MACAQUE CORTEX. COMPARED TO COLLATED DATA, OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE CORTICAL GRAPH IS DENSE. DENSITY IS A GRAPH THEORETIC MEASURE, AND REFERS TO THE NUMBER OF OBSERVED CONNECTIONS IN A SQUARE MATRIX EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE POSSIBLE CONNECTIONS. IN OUR DATABASE 66% OF THE CONNECTIONS THAT CAN EXIST DO EXIST WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THE GRAPH DENSITIES REPORTED IN STUDIES USING COLLATED DATA (7 32%). THE CONSISTENT DATA BASE REPORTS 37% MORE PATHWAYS THAN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, MANY OF WHICH ARE UNIDIRECTIONAL. THIS LATTER AND UNEXPECTED PROPERTY HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED IN EARLIER STUDIES. GIVEN THE HIGH DENSITY, THE RESULTING CORTICAL GRAPH SHOWS OTHER UNEXPECTED PROPERTIES. FIRSTLY, THE BINARY SPECIFICITY IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN EXPECTED. AS WE SHOW, THIS PROPERTY IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE INTER AREAL CONNECTION PROBABILITY DECLINING WITH DISTANCE. SECONDLY, SMALL GROUPS OF AREAS ARE FOUND TO RECEIVE HIGH NUMBERS OF INPUTS. THIS IS TERMED A HIGH DOMINATION AND IS ANALYZED BY A GRAPH THEORETIC PROCEDURE KNOWN AS A MINIMUM DOMINATING SET ANALYSIS. WE DISCUSS THESE FINDINGS WITH RESPECT TO THE LONG DISTANCE CONNECTIONS, OVER HALF OF WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY NOT REPORTED. THESE SO CALLED NEW FOUND PROJECTIONS DISPLAY HIGH SPECIFICITIES AND PLAY AN IMPORTANT INTEGRATION ROLE ACROSS LARGE REGIONS. IT IS TO BE EXPECTED THAT THE FUTURE EXAMINATION OF THE 62 REMAINING AREAS WILL DISCLOSE FURTHER LEVELS OF COMPLEXITY AND ENABLE CONSTRUCTION OF A WEIGHTED DIRECTED GRAPH REVEALING THE HIERARCHICAL COMPLEXITY OF THE CORTEX.

APPROACHES AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THEORY EXIST, WITH THE MOST OFTEN USED (SEMI )EMPIRICAL ONES BASED ON PAIR WISE INTERATOMIC C6R 6 TERMS. SIMILAR TERMS ARE NOW ALSO USED IN CONNECTION WITH SEMIEMPIRICAL QM (SQM) METHODS AND DENSITY FUNCTIONAL TIGHT BINDING METHODS (SCC DFTB). THEIR BASIC STRUCTURE EQUALS THE ATTRACTIVE TERM IN LENNARD JONES POTENTIALS, COMMON TO MOST FORCE FIELD APPROACHES, BUT THEY USUALLY USE SOME TYPE OF CUTOFF FUNCTION TO MAKE THE MIXING OF THE (LONG RANGE) DISPERSION TERM WITH THE ALREADY EXISTING (SHORT RANGE) DISPERSION AND EXCHANGE REPULSION EFFECTS FROM THE ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE THEORY METHODS POSSIBLE. ALL THESE DISPERSION APPROXIMATIONS WERE FOUND TO PERFORM ACCURATELY FOR SMALLER SYSTEMS, BUT ERROR ESTIMATES FOR LARGER SYSTEMS ARE VERY RARE AND COMPLETELY MISSING FOR REALLY LARGE BIOMOLECULES. WE DERIVE SUCH ESTIMATES FOR THE DISPERSION TERMS OF DFT, SQM AND MM METHODS USING ERROR STATISTICS FOR SMALLER SYSTEMS AND DISPERSION CONTRIBUTION ESTIMATES FOR THE PDBBIND DATABASE OF PROTEIN LIGAND INTERACTIONS.

AS THESE TECHNOLOGIES BECOME MORE POPULAR, MANY RESEARCH INSTITUTES HAVE ESTABLISHED CORE FACILITIES OF EXPERTISE TO DEAL WITH THE CHALLENGES OF LARGE SCALE HTS EXPERIMENTS. AS THE EFFORTS OF CORE FACILITY SCREENING PROJECTS COME TO FRUITION, FOCUS HAS SHIFTED TOWARDS MANAGING THE RESULTS OF THESE EXPERIMENTS AND MAKING THEM AVAILABLE IN A USEFUL FORMAT THAT CAN BE FURTHER MINED FOR PHENOTYPIC DISCOVERY. THE HTS DB DATABASE PROVIDES A PUBLIC VIEW OF DATA FROM SCREENING PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN BY THE HTS CORE FACILITY AT THE CRUK LONDON RESEARCH INSTITUTE. ALL PROJECTS AND SCREENS ARE DESCRIBED WITH COMPREHENSIVE ASSAY PROTOCOLS, AND DATASETS ARE PROVIDED WITH COMPLETE DESCRIPTIONS OF ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES. THIS FORMAT ALLOWS USERS TO BROWSE AND SEARCH DATA FROM LARGE SCALE STUDIES IN AN INFORMATIVE AND INTUITIVE WAY. IT ALSO PROVIDES A REPOSITORY FOR ADDITIONAL MEASUREMENTS OBTAINED FROM SCREENS THAT WERE NOT THE FOCUS OF THE PROJECT, SUCH AS CELL VIABILITY, AND GROUPS THESE DATA SO THAT IT CAN PROVIDE A GENE CENTRIC SUMMARY ACROSS SEVERAL DIFFERENT CELL LINES AND CONDITIONS. ALL DATASETS FROM OUR SCREENS THAT CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE CAN BE VIEWED INTERACTIVELY AND MINED FOR FURTHER HIT LISTS. WE BELIEVE THAT IN THIS FORMAT, THE DATABASE PROVIDES RESEARCHERS WITH RAPID ACCESS TO RESULTS OF LARGE SCALE EXPERIMENTS THAT MIGHT FACILITATE THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF GENES/COMPOUNDS IDENTIFIED IN THEIR OWN RESEARCH.

ONE OF THE INTERESTING ASPECTS OF THIS EVENT IS THE RESPONSE OF THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE AS NON ESCAPING MATERIAL FALLS INWARD UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GRAVITY. THE IMPACT SITES SHOW CLEAR EVIDENCE OF BRIGHTENING IN THE OBSERVED EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET WAVELENGTHS DUE TO ENERGY RELEASE. TWO PLAUSIBLE PHYSICAL MECHANISMS FOR EXPLAINING THE BRIGHTENING ARE CONSIDERED: HEATING OF THE PLASMA DUE TO THE KINETIC ENERGY OF IMPACTING MATERIAL COMPRESSING THE PLASMA, OR RECONNECTION BETWEEN THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF LOW LYING LOOPS AND THE FIELD CARRIED BY THE IMPACTING MATERIAL. BY ANALYZING THE EMISSION OF THE BRIGHTENINGS IN SEVERAL SDO/ATMOSPHERIC IMAGING ASSEMBLY WAVELENGTHS, AND COMPARING THE KINETIC ENERGY OF THE IMPACTING MATERIAL (7.6 X 10(26) 5.8 X 10(27) ERG) TO THE RADIATIVE ENERGY (APPROXIMATE TO 1.9 X 10(25) 2.5 X 10(26) ERG), WE FIND THE DOMINANT MECHANISM OF ENERGY RELEASE INVOLVED IN THE OBSERVED BRIGHTENING IS PLASMA COMPRESSION.	***

FOR SEVERAL YEARS, MANY METHODS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ESTIMATE THE ABUNDANCE OF GASES. HOWEVER, EXISTING METHODS DO NOT SIMULTANEOUSLY RETRIEVE THE PROPERTIES OF AEROSOLS AND OFTEN USE STANDARD AEROSOL MODELS TO DESCRIBE THE RADIATIVE IMPACT OF PARTICLES. THIS APPROACH IS NOT SUITED TO THE CHARACTERIZATION OF PLUMES, BECAUSE PLUME PARTICLES MAY HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT COMPOSITION AND SIZE DISTRIBUTION FROM AEROSOLS DESCRIBED BY THE STANDARD MODELS GIVEN BY RADIATIVE TRANSFER CODES. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A NEW METHOD TO SIMULTANEOUSLY RETRIEVE CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) AND AEROSOLS INSIDE A PLUME, COMBINING AN AEROSOL RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM USING VISIBLE AND NEAR INFRARED (VNIR) WAVELENGTHS AND A CO2 ESTIMATION ALGORITHM USING SHORTWAVE INFRARED (SWIR) WAVELENGTHS. THE MICROPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE PLUME PARTICLES, OBTAINED AFTER AEROSOL RETRIEVAL, ARE USED TO CALCULATE THEIR OPTICAL PROPERTIES IN THE SWIR. THEN, A DATABASE OF ATMOSPHERIC TERMS IS GENERATED WITH THE RADIATIVE TRANSFER CODE, MODERATE RESOLUTION ATMOSPHERIC TRANSMISSION (MODTRAN). FINALLY, PIXEL RADIANCES AROUND THE 2.0M ABSORPTION FEATURE ARE USED TO RETRIEVE THE CO2 ABUNDANCES. AFTER CONDUCTING A SIGNAL SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, THE METHOD WAS APPLIED TO TWO AIRBORNE VISIBLE/INFRARED IMAGING SPECTROMETER (AVIRIS) IMAGES ACQUIRED OVER AREAS OF BIOMASS BURNING. FOR THE FIRST IMAGE, IN SITU MEASUREMENTS WERE AVAILABLE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT INCLUDING THE AEROSOL RETRIEVAL STEP BEFORE THE CO2 ESTIMATION: (1) INDUCES A BETTER AGREEMENT BETWEEN IN SITU MEASUREMENTS AND RETRIEVED CO2 ABUNDANCES (THE CO2 OVERESTIMATION OF ABOUT 15%, INDUCED BY NEGLECTING AEROSOLS HAS BEEN CORRECTED, ESPECIALLY FOR PIXELS WHERE THE PLUME IS NOT VERY THICK); (2) REDUCES THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF ESTIMATED CO2 ABUNDANCE BY A FACTOR OF FOUR; AND (3) CAUSES THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF RETRIEVED CONCENTRATIONS TO BE COHERENT.	***

WE ANALYZE THIS DATABASE USING LINEAR MIXED EFFECT MODELS TO CONTROL FOR PHYLOGENY AND GEOGRAPHICAL LIMITS ON RANGE SIZE. OUR ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THREE ADULT TRAITS LIKELY TO AFFECT THE CAPACITY OF NEW COLONIZERS TO SURVIVE AND ESTABLISH REPRODUCTIVE POPULATIONS (BODY SIZE, SCHOOLING BEHAVIOR, AND NOCTURNAL ACTIVITY) ARE EQUAL OR BETTER PREDICTORS OF GEOGRAPHIC RANGE SIZE THAN PELAGIC LARVAL DURATION.

THIS DIFFICULTY LEADS US TO CONTEMPLATE SEVERAL QUESTIONS: HOW CAN WE DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF DIFFERENT STRUCTURES OF A GIVEN MOLECULAR SPECIES IF THEY CHANGE ACCORDING TO THE PHASE? COULD THESE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES BE PRESENT IN THE SAME PHASE SIMULTANEOUSLY? HOW CAN THEY BE DETERMINED? TO SHED LIGHT ON THESE QUESTIONS, WE OUTLINE A VERY COMPLETE STRATEGY BY USING VARIOUS VIBRATIONAL SPECTROSCOPIC TECHNIQUES THAT ARE SENSITIVE (VCD) AND INSENSITIVE (IR, FIR, AND RAMAN) TOWARDS THE CHIRALITY, TOGETHER WITH QUANTUM CHEMICAL CALCULATIONS.	***

PHENOL EXPLORER, LAUNCHED IN 2009, IS THE ONLY FREELY AVAILABLE WEB BASED DATABASE ON THE CONTENT OF POLYPHENOLS IN FOOD AND THEIR IN VIVO METABOLISM AND PHARMACOKINETICS. HERE WE REPORT THE THIRD RELEASE OF THE DATABASE (PHENOL EXPLORER 3.0), WHICH ADDS DATA ON THE EFFECTS OF FOOD PROCESSING ON POLYPHENOL CONTENTS IN FOODS. DATA ON >100 FOODS, COVERING 161 POLYPHENOLS OR GROUPS OF POLYPHENOLS BEFORE AND AFTER PROCESSING, WERE COLLECTED FROM 129 PEER REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS AND ENTERED INTO NEW TABLES LINKED TO THE EXISTING RELATIONAL DESIGN. THE EFFECT OF PROCESSING ON POLYPHENOL CONTENT IS EXPRESSED IN THE FORM OF RETENTION FACTOR COEFFICIENTS, OR THE PROPORTION OF A GIVEN POLYPHENOL RETAINED AFTER PROCESSING, ADJUSTED FOR CHANGE IN WATER CONTENT. THE RESULT IS THE FIRST DATABASE ON THE EFFECTS OF FOOD PROCESSING ON POLYPHENOL CONTENT AND, FOLLOWING THE MODEL INITIALLY DEFINED FOR PHENOL EXPLORER, ALL DATA MAY BE TRACED BACK TO ORIGINAL SOURCES. THE NEW UPDATE WILL ALLOW POLYPHENOL SCIENTISTS TO MORE ACCURATELY ESTIMATE POLYPHENOL EXPOSURE FROM DIETARY SURVEYS.	***

THE LEVEL OF PREOPERATIVE ANXIETY DEPENDS ON SEVERAL FACTORS AND MERITS AN OBJECTIVE EVALUATION. THE AMSTERDAM PREOPERATIVE ANXIETY AND INFORMATION SCALE (APAIS) IS A SELF REPORT QUESTIONNAIRE COMPRISING SIX QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED TO EVALUATE THE PREOPERATIVE ANXIETY OF PATIENTS. THIS GLOBAL INDEX ASSESSES THREE SEPARATE AREAS: ANXIETY ABOUT ANAESTHESIA, ANXIETY ABOUT SURGERY, AND THE DESIRE FOR INFORMATION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO TRANSLATE THE APAIS INTO FRENCH AND TO EVALUATE THE PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF THE FRENCH VERSION OF THE APAIS. METHODS: THE PROCESS CONSISTED OF TWO STEPS. THE FIRST STEP INVOLVED THE PRODUCTION OF A FRENCH VERSION OF THE APAIS THAT WAS SEMANTICALLY EQUIVALENT TO THE ORIGINAL VERSION. IN THE SECOND STEP, WE EVALUATED THE PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF THE FRENCH VERSION, INCLUDING THE INTERNAL CONSISTENCY AND RELIABILITY, THE DIFFERENTIAL ITEM FUNCTIONING, AND THE EXTERNAL VALIDITY. PARTICIPANTS OLDER THAN 18, UNDERGOING ELECTIVE SURGERY (EXCEPT OBSTETRIC), ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND READ FRENCH, AND ABLE TO COMPLETE A SELF REPORT QUESTIONNAIRE WERE ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION IN THE STUDY. A FORWARD BACKWARD TRANSLATION WAS PERFORMED. THE PSYCHOMETRIC EVALUATION COVERED THREE DOMAINS: INTERNAL VALIDITY, EXTERNAL VALIDITY, AND ACCEPTABILITY. WITHIN 4 48 H AFTER SURGERY, THE PATIENTS WERE ASKED TO COMPLETE THE EVALUATION DU VECU DE LANESTHESIE QUESTIONNAIRE (EVAN) QUESTIONNAIRE, WHICH IS A VALIDATED, MULTI DIMENSIONAL QUESTIONNAIRE THAT ASSESSES THE PATIENTS EXPERIENCES IN THE PERIOPERATIVE PERIOD. RESULTS: A DATABASE WITH 175 PATIENTS WAS CREATED. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT FACTOR ANALYSIS REVEALED THE SAME THREE DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE AS THE ORIGINAL SCALE. THE CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS SHOWED A STRONG FIT WITH A ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR OF APPROXIMATION OF 0.069 AND A COMPARATIVE FIT INDEX OF 1.00. THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENTIAL ITEM FUNCTIONING (DIF) BETWEEN THE SUBGROUPS OF PATIENTS (I.E., BASED ON AGE, GENDER, TYPE OF ANAESTHESIA OR SURGERY, PREMEDICATION, ASA PHYSICAL STATUS, AND AMBULATORY COURSE) WAS LOW. THE APAIS WAS STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH THE DIMENSIONS OF THE EVAN. EACH DIMENSION HAD A LOW PROPORTION OF MISSING VALUES (RANGING FROM 0.6 TO 2.9%), WHICH INDICATES GOOD ACCEPTABILITY OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE. CONCLUSIONS: THE FRENCH VERSION OF THE APAIS IS VALID AND RELIABLE. THE AVAILABILITY OF THIS TOOL ENABLES THE EVALUATION OF ANXIETY IN FRENCH PATIENTS UNDERGOING ANAESTHESIA.	***

METHODS: ELECTRONIC DATABASES (UPDATED TO DECEMBER 2012) AND MANUAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SEARCHES WERE CARRIED OUT. A META ANALYSIS OF ALL DIAGNOSTIC CLINICAL TRIALS EVALUATING THE ACCURACY OF EUS ELASTOGRAPHY IN DIFFERENTIATING PDAC FROM PIM WAS CONDUCTED. HETEROGENEITY WAS ASSESSED AMONG THE STUDIES. THE METAANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO EVALUATE THE ACCURACY OF EUS ELASTOGRAPHY IN DIFFERENTIATING PDAC FROM PIM IN HOMOGENEOUS STUDIES. RESULTS: TEN STUDIES INVOLVING 781 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. SIGNIFICANT HETEROGENEITY IN SENSITIVITY WAS OBSERVED AMONG THE STUDIES (COCHRAN Q TEST 24.16, DF 9, P 0.0041, I 2 62.8%), WHILE HETEROGENEITY IN SPECIFICITY WAS NOT OBSERVED (COCHRAN Q TEST 5.93, DF 9, P 0.7473, I 2 0.0%). THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE UNDER THE SPORTS RIGHTS OWNERS COALITION WAS 0.8227. EVALUATION OF HETEROGENEITY SUGGESTED THAT THE DIFFERENT DIAGNOSTIC STANDARDS USED IN THE INCLUDED STUDIES WERE THE SOURCE OF HETEROGENEITY. IN STUDIES USING THE COLOR PATTERN AS THE DIAGNOSTIC STANDARD, THE POOLED SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY, POSITIVE LIKELIHOOD RATIO (LR), NEGATIVE LR AND DIAGNOSTIC OR WERE 0.99 (0.97 1.00), 0.76 (0.67 0.83), 3.36 (2.39 4.72), 0.03 (0.01 0.07) AND 129.96 (47.02 359.16), RESPECTIVELY. IN STUDIES USING THE HUE HISTOGRAM AS THE DIAGNOSTIC STANDARD, THE POOLED SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY, POSITIVE LR, NEGATIVE LR AND DIAGNOSTIC OR WERE 0.92 (0.89 0.95), 0.68 (0.57 0.78), 2.84 (2.05 3.93), 0.12 (0.08 0.19) AND 24.69 (12.81 47.59), RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSION: EUS ELASTOGRAPHY IS A VALUABLE METHOD FOR THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS BETWEEN PDAC AND PIM.

EDUCATION OF PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS CAN LOWER PRESCRIBING LEVELS, BUT IT FREQUENTLY RELIES ON HIGHLY TRAINED STAFF. WE ASSESSED WHETHER INTERNET BASED TRAINING METHODS COULD ALTER PRESCRIBING PRACTICES IN MULTIPLE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS. METHODS AFTER A BASELINE AUDIT IN OCTOBER TO DECEMBER, 2010, PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES IN SIX EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WERE CLUSTER RANDOMISED TO USUAL CARE, TRAINING IN THE USE OF A C REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP) TEST AT POINT OF CARE, IN ENHANCED COMMUNICATION SKILLS, OR IN BOTH CRP AND ENHANCED COMMUNICATION. PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED FROM FEBRUARY TO MAY, 2011. THIS TRIAL IS REGISTERED, NUMBER ISRCTN99871214. RESULTS THE BASELINE AUDIT, DONE IN 259 PRACTICES, PROVIDED DATA FOR 6771 PATIENTS WITH LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS (3742 [55.3) AND UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS (1416 [20.9), OF WHOM 5355 (79.1%) WERE PRESCRIBED ANTIBIOTICS. AFTER RANDOMISATION, 246 PRACTICES WERE INCLUDED AND 4264 PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED. THE ANTIBIOTIC PRESCRIBING RATE WAS LOWER WITH CRP TRAINING THAN WITHOUT (33% VS 48%, ADJUSTED RISK RATIO 0.54, 95% CI 0.42 0.69) AND WITH ENHANCED COMMUNICATION TRAINING THAN WITHOUT (36% VS 45%, 0.69, 0.54 0.87). THE COMBINED INTERVENTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE GREATEST REDUCTION IN PRESCRIBING RATE (CRP RISK RATIO 0.53, 95% CI 0.36 0.74, P< 0.0001; ENHANCED COMMUNICATION 0.68, 0.50 0.89, P0.003; COMBINED 0.38, 0.25 0.55, P< 0.0001).

WHETHER OR NOT SUCH A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH IS FEASIBLE AND THE OUTCOMES ARE SUSTAINABLE AT A LARGE SCALE AND IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY SETTING HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN ASSESSED. METHODS IN THIS RETROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL COHORT STUDY, WE INCLUDED TREATED AND TREATMENT NAIVE HIV POSITIVE INDIVIDUALS WITH HIV NEGATIVE PARTNERS OF THE OPPOSITE SEX WHO HAD BEEN ADDED TO THE NATIONAL HIV EPIDEMIOLOGY AND TREATMENT DATABASES BETWEEN JAN 1, 2003 AND DEC 31, 2011. WE ANALYSED THE ANNUAL RATE OF HIV INFECTION IN HIVNEGATIVE PARTNERS DURING FOLLOW UP, STRATIFI ED BY TREATMENT STATUS OF THE INDEX PARTNER. COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS ANALYSES WERE DONE TO EXAMINE FACTORS RELATED TO HIV TRANSMISSION. FINDINGS BASED ON DATA FROM 38 862 SERODISCORDANT COUPLES, WITH 101 295.1 PERSON YEARS OF FOLLOW UP FOR THE SERONEGATIVE PARTNERS, RATES OF HIV INFECTION WERE 2.6 PER 100 PERSON YEARS (95% CI 2.4 2.8) AMONG THE 14 805 COUPLES IN THE TREATMENT NAIVE COHORT (MEDIAN BASELINE CD4 COUNT FOR HIV POSITIVE PARTNERS 441 CELLS PER MU L [IQR 314 590]) AND 1.3 PER 100 PERSON YEARS (1.2 1.3) AMONG THE 24 057 COUPLES IN THE TREATED COHORT (MEDIAN BASELINE CD4 COUNT FOR HIV POSITIVE PARTNERS 168 CELLS PER MU L [62 269]). WE CALCULATED A 26% RELATIVE REDUCTION IN HIV TRANSMISSION (ADJUSTED HAZARD RATIO 0.74, 95% CI 0.65 0.84) IN THE TREATED COHORT. THE REDUCTION IN TRANSMISSION WAS SEEN ACROSS ALMOST ALL DEMOGRAPHIC SUBGROUPS AND WAS SIGNIFI CANT IN THE FI RST YEAR (0.64, 0.54 0.76), AND AMONG COUPLES IN WHICH THE HIV POSITIVE PARTNER HAD BEEN INFECTED BY BLOOD OR PLASMA TRANSFUSION (0.76, 0.59 0.99) OR HETEROSEXUAL INTERCOURSE (0.69, 0.56 0.84), BUT NOT AMONG COUPLES IN WHICH THE HIV POSITIVE PARTNER WAS INFECTED BY INJECTING DRUGS (0.98, 0.71 1.36). INTERPRETATION ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY FOR HIV POSITIVE INDIVIDUALS IN SERODISCORDANT COUPLES REDUCED HIV TRANSMISSION ACROSS CHINA, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE TREATMENT AS PREVENTION APPROACH IS A FEASIBLE PUBLIC HEALTH PREVENTION STRATEGY ON A NATIONAL SCALE IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY CONTEXT. THE DURABILITY AND GENERALISABILITY OF SUCH PROTECTION, HOWEVER, NEEDS TO BE FURTHER STUDIED.	***

HIGH CONTENT APPLICATIONS REQUIRE TOOLS FOR THE AUTOMATED PROCESSING OF THE LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA. THESE TOOLS INCLUDE IN GENERAL SEVERAL IMAGE PROCESSING STEPS, THE EXTRACTION OF MORPHOLOGICAL DESCRIPTORS, AND THE GROUPING OF CELLS INTO PHENOTYPE CLASSES ACCORDING TO THEIR DESCRIPTORS. THIS PHENOTYPING CAN BE APPLIED IN A SUPERVISED OR AN UNSUPERVISED MANNER. UNSUPERVISED METHODS ARE SUITABLE FOR THE DISCOVERY OF FORMERLY UNKNOWN PHENOTYPES, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN HIGH THROUGHPUT RNAI TIME LAPSE SCREENS. RESULTS: WE DEVELOPED AN UNSUPERVISED PHENOTYPING APPROACH BASED ON HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS (HMMS) WITH MULTIVARIATE GAUSSIAN EMISSIONS FOR THE DETECTION OF KNOCKDOWN SPECIFIC PHENOTYPES IN RNAI TIME LAPSE MOVIES. THE AUTOMATED DETECTION OF ABNORMAL CELL MORPHOLOGIES ALLOWS US TO ASSIGN A PHENOTYPIC FINGERPRINT TO EACH GENE KNOCKDOWN. BY APPLYING OUR METHOD TO THE MITOCHECK DATABASE, WE SHOW THAT A PHENOTYPIC FINGERPRINT IS INDICATIVE OF A GENES FUNCTION. CONCLUSION: OUR FULLY UNSUPERVISED HMM BASED PHENOTYPING IS ABLE TO AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFY CELL MORPHOLOGIES THAT ARE SPECIFIC FOR A CERTAIN KNOCKDOWN. BEYOND THE IDENTIFICATION OF GENES WHOSE KNOCKDOWN AFFECTS CELL MORPHOLOGY, PHENOTYPIC FINGERPRINTS CAN BE USED TO FIND MODULES OF FUNCTIONALLY RELATED GENES.	***

ABERRANT NOTCH SIGNALING REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT ONCOGENIC MECHANISM FOR T CELL ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA (T ALL), AN AGGRESSIVE SUBSET OF THE MOST COMMON MALIGNANT CHILDHOOD CANCER ALL. THEREFORE, UNDERSTANDING THE MOLECULAR REGULATION OF NOTCH SIGNALING IS CRITICAL TO IDENTIFY NEW APPROACHES TO BLOCK ABERRANT NOTCH ONCOGENIC ACTIVITY. THE FAMILY OF THREE MAML TRANSCRIPTIONAL COACTIVATORS IS CRUCIAL FOR NOTCH SIGNALING ACTIVATION. THE PROTOTYPIC MEMBER MAML1 IS THE MAJOR COACTIVATOR THAT REGULATES NOTCH ONCOGENIC ACTIVITIES IN LEUKEMIC CELLS. HOWEVER, THE MOLECULAR BASIS UNDERLYING MAML1 COACTIVATOR FUNCTION THAT CONTRIBUTES TO NOTCH SIGNALING REMAINS UNCLEAR. IN THIS STUDY, WE PERFORMED PROTEOMIC STUDIES AND IDENTIFIED DDX5, AN ATP DEPENDENT DEAD BOX RNA HELICASE, AS A COMPONENT OF THE MAML1 PROTEIN COMPLEX. DDX5 INTERACTS WITH MAML1 IN VITRO AND IN VIVO, AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENDOGENOUS NOTCH1 TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATION COMPLEX IN HUMAN T ALL LEUKEMIC CELLS. LENTIVIRUS MEDIATED SHORT HAIRPIN RNA KNOCK DOWN OF DDX5 RESULTED IN DECREASED EXPRESSION OF NOTCH TARGET GENES, REDUCED CELL PROLIFERATION AND INCREASED APOPTOSIS IN CULTURED HUMAN LEUKEMIC CELLS WITH CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVATION OF NOTCH SIGNALING. ALSO, DDX5 DEPLETION INHIBITED THE GROWTH OF HUMAN LEUKEMIA XENOGRAFT IN NUDE MICE. MOREOVER, DDX5 IS HIGHLY EXPRESSED IN PRIMARY HUMAN T ALL LEUKEMIC CELLS BASED ON THE ANALYSES OF ONCOMINE AND GEO DATABASES, AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINING. OUR OVERALL FINDINGS REVEALED A CRITICAL ROLE OF DDX5 IN PROMOTING EFFICIENT NOTCH MEDIATED TRANSCRIPTION IN LEUKEMIC CELLS, SUGGESTING THAT DDX5 MIGHT BE CRITICAL FOR NOTCH1 MEDIATED T ALL PATHOGENESIS AND THUS IS A POTENTIAL NEW TARGET FOR MODULATING THE NOTCH SIGNALING IN LEUKEMIA.	***

SPAM FILTERING ALLOWS FOR EARLY DETECTION OF UNWANTED MESSAGES AND SEPARATES THEM FROM THE INCOMING E MAIL. NONETHELESS, DESIGNING AN EFFECTIVE SPAM DETECTION SYSTEM IS NOT A TRIVIAL TASK, DUE TO THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE ANALYSIS OF THE E MAIL CONTENT AND THE OCCURRENCE OF VARIATION IN SPAM CHARACTERISTICS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS AN APPLICATION OF A NOVEL ENSEMBLE CLASSIFIER SYSTEM FOR SPAM DETECTION. THE SYSTEM IS AN EXTENSION OF THE ADAPTIVE SPLITTING AND SELECTION (ADASS) FRAMEWORK. THE IDEA OF THE ENSEMBLE IS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT HIGH EFFECTIVENESS OF DETECTION CAN BE OBTAINED BY EXPLOITATION OF THE LOCAL COMPETENCY OF A SET OF DIVERSE ELEMENTARY CLASSIFIERS. THEREFORE, THE ENSEMBLE TRAINING ALGORITHM DIVIDES THE FEATURE SPACE INTO SEVERAL DISJOINT SUBSPACES AND ASSIGNS AN AREA CLASSIFIER TO EACH OF THEM. THE AREA CLASSIFIER CONSISTS OF ELEMENTARY CLASSIFIERS THAT MAKE A COLLECTIVE DECISION BASED ON THE WEIGHTED FUSION OF THEIR SUPPORT FUNCTIONS. THE WEIGHT REFLECTS THE LOCAL COMPETENCY OF THE CLASSIFIER. TO MAINTAIN THE DIVERSITY OF THE POOL OF ELEMENTARY CLASSIFIERS, WE EXPLOIT DIFFERENT E MAIL FEATURE EXTRACTION METHODS WHILE FILLING THE POOL. THERE ARE TWO MAIN EXTENSIONS OF THE PRESENTED ALGORITHM OVER ORIGINAL ADASS: THE AFOREMENTIONED WEIGHTED FUSION MODEL USED FOR DECISION MAKING AND ADAPTATION OF THE ADASS TRAINING PROCEDURE TO PROCESS DATA STREAMS FEATURING THE CONCEPT DRIFT. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CLASSIFIER MODEL IN SPAM RECOGNITION WAS VERIFIED IN A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS ON TWO SETS OF SPAM DATABASES. COMPARISON OF THE ALGORITHM WITH SOME OTHER STATE OF THE ART ENSEMBLE METHODS SHOWED THAT THE PRESENTED ADASS EXTENSION CAN EFFECTIVELY RECOGNIZE LOCAL COMPETENCES OF ELEMENTARY CLASSIFIERS AND RESULT IN VERY HIGH EFFECTIVENESS OF SPAM RECOGNITION OUTPERFORMING COMPETING METHODS.	***

TO IMPROVE SURVIVABILITY OF OVERLAY MULTICASTING, WE PROPOSE USING A DUAL HOMING APPROACH; THAT IS, EACH PEER IS CONNECTED TO THE OVERLAY BY TWO SEPARATE ACCESS LINKS. WE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING NETWORK FAILURES: OVERLAY LINK FAILURE, UPLOADING NODE FAILURE, AND INTERNET SERVER PROVIDER (ISP) INTERCONNECTION FAILURE. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO MINIMIZE THE MAXIMUM DELAY IN THE NETWORK. THE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM IS FORMULATED IN THE FORM OF AN INTEGER LINEAR PROGRAMMING (ILP) MODEL. WE INTRODUCE A SIMULATED ANNEALING (SA) ALGORITHM AND A TABU SEARCH (TS) ALGORITHM FOR THE CONSIDERED PROBLEM AND COMPARE THEM WITH OPTIMAL RESULTS PROVIDED BY CPLEX SOLVER. OUR STUDIES DEMONSTRATE THAT BOTH SA AND TS METHODS YIELD RESULTS CLOSE TO OPTIMAL AND PROVIDE BETTER SCALABILITY COMPARED TO CPLEX, BECAUSE THEY CAN SOLVE MUCH LARGER PROBLEM INSTANCES THAN CPLEX IN REASONABLE TIME. FURTHERMORE, OUR STUDIES SHOW THAT THE ADDITIONAL SURVIVABILITY REQUIREMENTS DO NOT HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE OVERLAY MULTICASTING SYSTEM EXPRESSED AS THE MAXIMUM DELAY.	***

OUT OF THE INTERNAL MEDICINE JOURNAL ARTICLES, WE ANALYZED THOSE IN WHICH ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION WAS THE MAIN TOPIC (349 ARTICLES). A TOTAL OF 349 ARTICLES WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM THE TRANSPLANTATION JOURNALS FOR CONTENT ANALYSIS. RESULTS: IN OUR SAMPLE, ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION WAS DESCRIBED IN POSITIVE TERMS AND WAS PRESENTED AS A ROUTINE TREATMENT. FEW ARTICLES ADDRESSED ETHICAL ISSUES, PATIENTS EXPERIENCES AND UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION. THE INTERNAL MEDICINE JOURNALS REPORTED ON MORE ETHICAL ISSUES THAN THE TRANSPLANTATION JOURNALS. THE MOST IMPORTANT ETHICAL ISSUES DISCUSSED WERE RELATED TO THE JUSTICE PRINCIPLE: ORGAN ALLOCATION, DIFFERENTIAL ACCESS TO TRANSPLANTATION, AND THE ORGAN SHORTAGE.

DISCOVERY OF PAN CANCER DRIVERS WILL HELP CHARACTERIZE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS IMPORTANT IN MULTIPLE CANCERS AND LEAD TO DEVELOPMENT OF BETTER THERAPIES. DRIVER GENES ARE MOST OFTEN IDENTIFIED BY THEIR RECURRENT MUTATIONS ACROSS TUMOR SAMPLES. HOWEVER, SOME MUTATIONS ARE MORE IMPORTANT FOR PROTEIN FUNCTION THAN OTHERS. THUS CONSIDERING THE LOCATION OF MUTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO FUNCTIONAL PROTEIN SITES CAN PREDICT THEIR MECHANISMS OF ACTION AND IMPROVE THE SENSITIVITY OF DRIVER GENE DETECTION. PROTEIN PHOSPHORYLATION IS A POST TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATION CENTRAL TO CANCER BIOLOGY AND TREATMENT, AND FREQUENTLY ALTERED BY DRIVER MUTATIONS. HERE WE USED OUR ACTIVEDRIVER METHOD TO ANALYZE KNOWN PHOSPHORYLATION SITES MUTATED BY SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE VARIANTS (SNVS) IN THE CANCER GENOME ATLAS RESEARCH NETWORK (TCGA) PAN CANCER DATASET OF 3,185 GENOMES AND 12 CANCER TYPES. PHOSPHORYLATION RELATED SNVS (PSNVS) OCCUR IN SIMILAR TO 90% OF TUMORS, SHOW INCREASED CONSERVATION AND FUNCTIONAL MUTATION IMPACT COMPARED TO OTHER PROTEIN CODING MUTATIONS, AND ARE ENRICHED IN CANCER GENES AND PATHWAYS. GENE CENTRIC ANALYSIS FOUND 150 KNOWN AND CANDIDATE CANCER GENES WITH SIGNIFICANT PSNV RECURRENCE. USING A NOVEL COMPUTATIONAL METHOD, WE PREDICT THAT 29% OF THESE MUTATIONS DIRECTLY ABOLISH PHOSPHORYLATION OR MODIFY KINASE TARGET SITES TO REWIRE SIGNALING PATHWAYS. THIS ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT INCORPORATION OF INFORMATION ABOUT PROTEIN SIGNALING SITES WILL IMPROVE COMPUTATIONAL PIPELINES FOR VARIANT FUNCTION PREDICTION.	***

OBJECTIVES TO SUMMARIZE EVIDENCE REGARDING THE ROLE OF AXILLARY INTERVENTIONS (SURGICAL AND NONSURGICAL) IN BREAST CANCER TREATMENT AND TO REVIEW THE ASSOCIATION OF THESE AXILLARY INTERVENTIONS WITH RECURRENCE OF AXILLARY NODE METASTASES, MORTALITY, AND MORBIDITY OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. EVIDENCE REVIEW OVID MEDLINE (1946 JULY 2013), COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS (2005 JULY 2013), COCHRANE DATABASE OF ABSTRACTS OF REVIEWS OF EFFECTS (1994 JULY 2013), AND COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (1989 JULY 2013) WERE SEARCHED FOR PUBLICATIONS ON AXILLARY INTERVENTIONS IN BREAST CANCER. CLINICAL TRIALS, OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES, AND META ANALYSES WITH AT LEAST 2 YEAR FOLLOW UP WERE INCLUDED. A TOTAL OF 1070 PUBLICATIONS WERE REVIEWED, 17 OF WHICH MET FINAL INCLUSION CRITERIA. FINDINGS PARTIAL MASTECTOMY FOLLOWED BY WHOLE BREAST RADIATION IS BREAST CONSERVING THERAPY. FOR WOMEN WITH NO SUSPICIOUS, PALPABLE AXILLARY NODES WHO UNDERGO BREAST CONSERVING THERAPY, THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF BENEFIT FROM SURGICAL COMPLETE AXILLARY NODE DISSECTION COMPARED WITH SENTINEL NODE BIOPSY ALONE. COMPLETE AXILLARY NODE DISSECTION IN PATIENTS WITH NO PALPABLE LYMPH NODES, COMPARED WITH SENTINEL NODE BIOPSY, PROVIDES NO SURVIVAL BENEFIT AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH A 1% TO 3% REDUCTION IN RECURRENCE OF AXILLARY LYMPH NODE METASTASES, BUT IS ASSOCIATED WITH A 14% RISK OF LYMPHEDEMA. SURGICAL AXILLARY STAGING VIA SENTINEL NODE BIOPSY IN PATIENTS WITH BENIGN AXILLARY NODES ON RADIOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL EXAMINATION HELPS TO INFORM DECISIONS REGARDING ADJUVANT SYSTEMIC AND RADIATION THERAPY. PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS SHOULD TAILOR AXILLARY LYMPH NODE INTERVENTIONS TO MAXIMIZE REGIONAL DISEASE CONTROL AND MINIMIZE MORBIDITY. COMPLETE AXILLARY LYMPH NODE DISSECTION IS INDICATED IN PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WITH PALPABLE OR NEEDLE BIOPSY PROVEN AXILLARY METASTASES, PATIENTS WITH POSITIVE SENTINEL NODES UNDERGOING MASTECTOMY (WHO DO NOT, AS A STANDARD, RECEIVE ADJUVANT RADIATION), PATIENTS WITH MORE THAN 3 POSITIVE SENTINEL NODES UNDERGOING BREAST CONSERVING THERAPY, AND PATIENTS NOT MEETING ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR RECENT TRIALS ESTABLISHING THE SAFETY OF SENTINEL NODE BIOPSY ALONE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER AND METASTASES IN THEIR SENTINEL NODES. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT AXILLARY NODE DISSECTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE HARM THAN BENEFIT IN WOMEN UNDERGOING BREAST CONSERVING THERAPY WHO DO NOT HAVE PALPABLE, SUSPICIOUS LYMPH NODES, WHO HAVE TUMORS 3.0 CM OR SMALLER, AND WHO HAVE 3 OR FEWER POSITIVE NODES ON SENTINEL NODE BIOPSY.	***

A PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL, INCLUDING THE QRT PCR EXPRESSION OF CD28, ICOS, LCK, AND ITK ALONG WITH PATIENTS AGE, GENDER, AND PERCENT PREDICTED FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC%), DEMONSTRATED AN AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE OF 78.5% AT 2.4 MONTHS FOR DEATH AND LUNG TRANSPLANT PREDICTION IN THE REPLICATION COHORT. TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL CELLULAR SOURCE OF CD28, ICOS, LCK, AND ITK EXPRESSION, WE ANALYZED AND FOUND SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION OF THESE GENES WITH THE PBMC PERCENTAGE OF CD4(+)CD28(+) T CELLS IN THE REPLICATION COHORT. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CD28, ICOS, LCK, AND ITK ARE POTENTIAL OUTCOME BIOMARKERS IN IPF AND SHOULD BE FURTHER EVALUATED FOR PATIENT PRIORITIZATION FOR LUNG TRANSPLANTATION AND STRATIFICATION IN DRUG STUDIES.	***

IN THE ORIGINAL METHOD, SULFURIC ACID ALONE WAS USED AS A DIGESTION MEDIUM. THE USE OF A CATALYST IN KJELDAHL DIGESTION ACCELERATES OXIDATION AND COMPLETES THE DIGESTION TO ALLOW THE SUBSEQUENT DETERMINATION OF NITROGEN. MERCURY (ITS USE BEING IN DECLINE BECAUSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS), SELENIUM, AND COPPER ARE THE CATALYSTS OF CHOICE, THOUGH FOR CERTAIN APPLICATIONS TITANIUM HAS FOUND SOME USAGE. SHORT DIGESTION TIMES IN ASSOCIATION WITH MAXIMUM NITROGEN RECOVERY MAY BE ACHIEVED BY USING A METHODOLOGY BASED ON EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESPONSE SURFACES, WITH MICROWAVE DIGESTION PROCESSES, AND WITH THE AID OF THE COUPLE SULFURIC ACID HYDROGEN PEROXIDE WITHOUT CATALYST. THE QUANTIFICATION OF DISTILLED AMMONIA IS GENERALLY ACHIEVED BY TITRATION; THE AMMONIA IS ABSORBED IN AN EXCESS OF BORIC ACID, FOLLOWED BY TITRATION WITH STANDARD ACID IN THE PRESENCE OF A SUITABLE INDICATOR. THE KJELDAHL METHOD CAN BE DONE WITH LIMITED RESOURCES; NITROGEN DETERMINATION WITH THE KJELDAHL METHOD DOES NOT REQUIRE EXPENSIVE DEVICES NOR SPECIALIZED TECHNIQUES AND IS PRECISE AND ACCURATE. THE KJELDAHL METHOD IS USED FOR CALIBRATING OTHER PROTEIN ASSAYS; IT IS STILL THE PRIMARY REFERENCE METHOD FOR PROTEIN ANALYSIS TODAY. THE ORIGINAL METHOD AS PRESENTED BY KJELDAHL HAS BEEN CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVED. TODAYS DIGESTION SYSTEMS OFFER SAFETY BOTH FROM A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE AND FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL POINT OF VIEW. THE DETERMINATION OF NITROGEN CONTENT IS A FREQUENTLY CONDUCTED ANALYSIS IN INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE, AND NUMEROUS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE OFFICIAL METHODS. THE USE OF INSTRUMENTAL FINISH IN KJELDHAL APPLICATIONS WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF THE SECOND PART OF THIS REVIEW.	***

THE BARWIN LIKE PROTEIN WAS PURIFIED FROM CARICA PAPAYA LATEX AND CRYSTALLIZED IN THE ORTHORHOMBIC SPACE GROUP P2(1)2(1)2(1). USING IN HOUSE CU K ALPHA X RAY RADIATION, 16 CUMULATIVE DIFFRACTION DATA SETS WERE ACQUIRED TO INCREASE THE SIGNAL TO NOISE LEVEL AND THEREBY THE ANOMALOUS SCATTERING SIGNAL. A SEQUENCE DATABASE SEARCH ON THE PAPAYA GENOME IDENTIFIED TWO CARWIN ISOFORMS OF 122 RESIDUES IN LENGTH, BOTH CONTAINING SIX S ATOMS THAT YIELD AN ESTIMATED BIJVOET RATIO OF 0.93% AT 1.54 ANGSTROM WAVELENGTH. A SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF DATA QUALITY AND REDUNDANCY WAS PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE CAPACITY TO LOCATE THE S ATOMS AND TO PHASE THE DATA. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE CRYSTAL DECAY WAS LOW DURING DATA COLLECTION AND THAT SUCCESSFUL S SAD PHASING COULD BE OBTAINED WITH A RELATIVELY LOW DATA MULTIPLICITY OF ABOUT 7. USING A SYNCHROTRON SOURCE, HIGH RESOLUTION DATA (1 A) WERE COLLECTED FROM TWO DIFFERENT CRYSTAL FORMS OF THE PAPAYA LATEX CARWIN. THE REFINED STRUCTURES SHOWED A CENTRAL BETA BARREL OF SIX STRANDS SURROUNDED BY SEVERAL ALPHA HELICES AND LOOPS. THE BETA BARREL OF CARWIN APPEARS TO BE A COMMON STRUCTURAL MODULE THAT IS SHARED WITHIN SEVERAL OTHER UNRELATED PROTEINS. FINALLY, THE POSSIBLE BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF THE PROTEIN IS DISCUSSED.	***

THIS STUDY HAS AIMED TO IDENTIFY THE DIFFERENT VARIABLES THAT MIGHT INFLUENCE DECREASE OF HEMOGLOBIN DURING THE SURGERY PERFORMED IN SUPINE POSITION. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE, MULTICENTER, OBSERVATIONAL STUDY OF SUPINE PCNL, BASED ON THE SPANISH ASSOCIATION OF UROLOGY DATABASE, WAS ANALYZED. THE DIFFERENT PREOPERATIVE AND POSTOPERATIVE FACTORS THAT MIGHT AFFECT THE DECREASE OF HEMOGLOBIN WERE ASSESSED: DEMOGRAPHICS AND ANTHROPOMETRIC DATA, COMORBIDITIES, SIZE AND LOCATION OF THE STONES, ANATOMICAL VARIANTS AND TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE PROCEDURE. RESULTS: FROM SEPTEMBER 2008 TO DECEMBER 2012, 397 SUPINE PCNL PROCEDURES PERFORMED IN 15 SPANISH CENTERS WERE REGISTERED. MEAN HEMOGLOBIN DECREASE WAS 2.3 +/ 1.5 G/DL AND OVERALL BLOOD TRANSFUSION RATE WAS 5.5%. NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND BETWEEN GENDERS, BODY MASS INDEX (BM) AND AGE IN TERMS OF BLOOD LOSS. THERE WERE ALSO NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH CARDIOVASCULAR, HYPERTENSIVE, DIABETIC AND ANTICOAGULANT TREATMENT BACKGROUND. BLOOD LOSS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY STONE SIZE AND LOCATION. TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE PROCEDURE AS OPERATIVE TIME (> 120 MIN <), ACCESS TO THE PELVI CALICEAL SYSTEM (ULTRASOUND, FLUOROSCOPY), PERCUTANEOUS TRACT DILATION TECHNIQUE (ALKEN, BALLOON OR AMPLATZ) OR PLACEMENT OF NEPHROSTOMY (TUBE VERSUS TUBELESS) WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENCES IN PRE OP/POST OP HEMOGLOBIN. ONLY MULTIPLE PERCUTANEOUS TRACTS (> 2) AND MIDDLE CALIX ACCESS WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY (P.03 AND P.01) RELATED WITH LESS BLOOD LOSS. CONCLUSIONS: PCNL IN SUPINE POSITION IS A MINIMALLY INVASIVE PROCEDURE FOR REMOVAL OF LARGE (> 2 CM) AND MULTIPLE RENAL STONES, WITH A LOW INCIDENCE OF BLOOD LOSS AND MINIMAL TRANSFUSION RATE. MULTIPLE PERCUTANEOUS TRACTS AND MIDDLE CALIX PUNCTURE WERE THE ONLY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT VARIABLES ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASE IN HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS. (C) 2013 AEU.

SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE: INFERTILE COUPLES SUFFERS INFERTILITY BY IMMUNOLOGICAL MECHANISMS MAINLY BY THE PRESENCE OF ANTISPERM ANTIBODIES ASA IN BLOOD, SEMEN OR CERVICOVAGINAL SECRETIONS; THE FORMATION OF ASA IN MEN AND WOMEN MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH DISTURBANCE IN IMMUNOMODULATORY MECHANISMS THAT RESULT IN FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT OF SPERM AND THUS ITS INABILITY TO FERTILIZE THE OOCYTE. CONCLUSION: IMMUNOLOGICAL INFERTILITY CAUSED BY ASA IS THE RESULT OF INTERFERENCE OF THESE ANTIBODIES IN VARIOUS STAGES OF FERTILIZATION PROCESS, INHIBITING THE ABILITY OF INTERACTION BETWEEN SPERM AND OOCYTE.

FIFTY FIVE SEQUENCES WERE ALIGNED AND SUBJECTED TO PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS, REVEALING THE PRESENCE OF A CLUSTER OF 29 VIRUS SEQUENCES. ALL EXCEPT ONE OF THOSE SEQUENCES WERE FROM ANTIRETROVIRAL (ARV) NAIVE PATIENTS AT THE TIME OF SAMPLING, AND 22 HAD THE K103N MUTATION. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA OF CLUSTERED PATIENTS WERE COLLECTED THROUGH THE INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SEVENTY TWO PERCENT OF THE CLUSTERED PATIENTS WERE INFECTED THROUGH HOMOSEXUAL OR BISEXUAL CONTACTS WHILE THE OTHERS REPORTED HETEROSEXUAL CONTACTS ONLY. ALL PATIENTS RESIDE AND WERE INFECTED IN BELGIUM. SIXTEEN WERE DIAGNOSED BETWEEN JANUARY 2011 AND JUNE 2012; 14 WERE AGED BETWEEN 18 AND 29 YEARS AT THE TIME OF DIAGNOSIS. NEARLY 60% OF THE CLUSTERED PATIENTS LIVE CLOSE TO THE CITY OF NAMUR, WHERE HIV INCIDENCE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED IN THE PAST 2 YEARS. THE IDENTIFICATION OF THIS TRANSMISSION NETWORK ADVOCATES FOR LOCAL PREVENTION REINFORCEMENT AND UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR CONTINUOUS TDR MONITORING.

HOWEVER, THE OPTIMAL TREATMENT REGIMEN REMAINS UNCLEAR. AIMTO PERFORM A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META ANALYSIS COMPARING THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF ANTIBIOTIC THERAPIES IN THE TREATMENT OF SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS WITH DOCUMENTED SIBO. METHODSFOUR DATABASES WERE SEARCHED TO IDENTIFY CLINICAL TRIALS COMPARING EFFECTIVENESS OF: (I) DIFFERENT ANTIBIOTICS, (II) DIFFERENT DOSES OF THE SAME ANTIBIOTIC AND (III) ANTIBIOTICS COMPARED WITH PLACEBO. DATA WERE INDEPENDENTLY EXTRACTED ACCORDING TO PREDETERMINED INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA. STUDY QUALITY WAS INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS NORMALISATION OF POST TREATMENT BREATH TESTING. THE SECONDARY OUTCOME WAS POST TREATMENT CLINICAL RESPONSE. RESULTSOF 1356 ARTICLES IDENTIFIED, 10 MET INCLUSION CRITERIA. RIFAXIMIN WAS THE MOST COMMONLY STUDIED ANTIBIOTIC (EIGHT STUDIES) WITH OVERALL BREATH TEST NORMALISATION RATE OF 49.5% (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, CI 44.0 55.1) (44.0% 55.1%) THEN (46.7% 55.5%), THEN (4.6% 17.8%). ANTIBIOTIC EFFICACY VARIED BY ANTIBIOTIC REGIMEN AND DOSE. ANTIBIOTICS WERE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN PLACEBO, WITH A COMBINED BREATH TEST NORMALISATION RATE OF 51.1% (95% CI 46.7 55.5) FOR ANTIBIOTICS COMPARED WITH 9.8% (95% CI 4.6 17.8) FOR PLACEBO. META ANALYSIS OF FOUR STUDIES FAVOURED ANTIBIOTICS OVER PLACEBO FOR BREATH TEST NORMALISATION WITH AN ODDS RATIO OF 2.55 (95% CI 1.29 5.04). CLINICAL RESPONSE WAS HETEROGENEOUSLY EVALUATED AMONG SIX STUDIES, BUT TENDED TO CORRELATE WITH BREATH TEST NORMALISATION. CONCLUSIONSANTIBIOTICS APPEAR TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN PLACEBO FOR BREATH TEST NORMALISATION IN PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SIBO, AND BREATH TEST NORMALISATION MAY CORRELATE WITH CLINICAL RESPONSE. STUDIES WERE LIMITED BY MODEST QUALITY, SMALL SAMPLE SIZE AND HETEROGENEOUS DESIGN. ADDITIONAL HIGHER QUALITY CLINICAL TRIALS OF SIBO THERAPY ARE WARRANTED.	***

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE CLINICAL PREDICTORS OF NORMAL ANGIOGRAMS AND WHETHER THIS RATE VARIES ACROSS DIFFERENT CARDIAC CENTERS IN ONTARIO. METHODS WE CONDUCTED A STUDY USING THE CARDIAC CARE NETWORK VARIATIONS IN REVASCULARIZATION PRACTICE IN ONTARIO DATABASE OF 2,718 PATIENTS UNDERGOING AN INDEX CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION FOR AN INDICATION OF STABLE ANGINA BETWEEN APRIL 2006 AND MARCH 2007 AT ONE OF 17 CARDIAC HOSPITALS IN ONTARIO. WE DETERMINED PREDICTORS OF NORMAL CORONARY ANGIOGRAMS (0% CORONARY STENOSIS) AND COMPARED RATES OF PATIENTS WITH NORMAL CATHETERIZATIONS ACROSS CENTERS. RESULTS OVERALL, 41.9% OF PATIENTS WITH STABLE ANGINA HAD A NORMAL CATHETERIZATION. A MULTIVARIATE MODEL DEMONSTRATED FEMALE GENDER TO BE THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR OF A NORMAL ANGIOGRAM (ODDS RATIO 3.55, 95% CI 2.93 4.28). IN ADDITION, ATYPICAL ISCHEMIC SYMPTOMS OR NO SYMPTOMS, THE ABSENCE OF DIABETES, HYPERLIPIDEMIA, SMOKING HISTORY, PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE, AND ANGIOGRAPHY PERFORMED AT A NONTEACHING SITE WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER RATES OF NORMAL CATHETERIZATION. THE RATE OF NORMAL ANGIOGRAMS STUDIED VARIED FROM 18.4% TO 76.9% ACROSS HOSPITALS AND WAS MORE COMMON IN COMMUNITY COMPARED WITH ACADEMIC SETTINGS (47.1% VS 35.4%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS THE ABSENCE OF TRADITIONAL CARDIAC RISK FACTORS, FEMALE GENDER, AND LACK OF TYPICAL ANGINA SYMPTOMS ARE ALL ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGHER FREQUENCY OF NORMAL CARDIAC CATHETERIZATIONS.

METHODS WE CREATED A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT OF 3779 PATIENTS WITH CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE WHO WERE FOLLOWED UP IN A CARDIOLOGY CLINIC AT AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER USING AN EHR DATABASE. OF THESE 3779 PATIENTS, 300 RANDOMLY SELECTED CHARTS WERE REVIEWED TO IDENTIFY REASONS FOR FAILURE TO ADHERE TO LIPID MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE MEASURES. RESULTS BASED ON THE EHR, A LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL MEASUREMENT WAS OBTAINED IN 73% OF PATIENTS WITHIN THE PAST 3 YEARS; OF WHICH, 34% HAD LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL LEVELS > 100 MG/DL AND STATIN THERAPY HAD BEEN PRESCRIBED IN 88%. MANUAL CHART REVIEW REVEALED THAT MANY OF THESE APPARENT FAILURES WERE ACTUALLY FALSE POSITIVES, DUE TO INACCURATE CAPTURE OF INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS TO LIPID MEASUREMENT AND STATIN PRESCRIPTION, PATIENT/PROVIDER TREATMENT PREFERENCES, AND EXTERNAL DATA SOURCES. CONCLUSIONS WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE TO MONITOR ADHERENCE TO LIPID MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE MEASURES USING AN EHR, THE ACCURACY OF THIS ASSESSMENT IS CURRENTLY LIMITED AND MAY UNDERESTIMATE PROVIDER QUALITY OF CARE.	***

METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN A HIGH VOLUME TERTIARY CARE FACILITY IN THE CENTRAL ANATOLIAN REGION. CLINICAL DATA WERE EXTRACTED FROM HOSPITAL DATABASES FOR ALL ELIGIBLE GERIATRIC PATIENTS (EITHER DRIVER, PASSENGER OR PEDESTRIAN) WITH ENTRIES DATED BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2007, AND DECEMBER 31, 2009. MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ASSESS THE IN HOSPITAL MORTALITY EFFECTS OF VARIABLES INCLUDING DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, TRAUMA MECHANISMS, INJURED BODY PARTS AND VARIOUS TRAUMA SCORES. RESULTS: THERE WERE 395 GERIATRIC MOTOR VEHICLE TRAUMA PRESENTATIONS TO THE ED DURING THE 3 YEAR PERIOD. OF THESE PATIENTS, 371 (93.9%) SURVIVED, AND 24 (6.1%) DIED IN THE ED, OPERATING ROOM OR INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. THE MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES: HEART FAILURE, CRANIAL TRAUMA, ABDOMINAL TRAUMA, THORACIC TRAUMA, PELVIC TRAUMA, GLASGOW COMA SCORE AND INJURY SEVERITY SCORE (ISS). THESE VARIABLES WERE CHOSEN BECAUSE UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THEY WERE POTENTIAL PREDICTORS OF MORTALITY. THE MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION SHOWED THAT THE PRESENCE OF HEART FAILURE (OR: 20.2), CRANIAL TRAUMA (OR: 3.6), ABDOMINAL TRAUMA (OR: 26.9), PELVIC TRAUMA (OR: 9.9) AND ISS (OR: 1.2) WERE PREDICTORS OF IN HOSPITAL MORTALITY IN THE STUDY POPULATION. CONCLUSION: IN OUR STUDY, HEART FAILURE, CRANIAL TRAUMA, ABDOMINAL TRAUMA, PELVIC TRAUMA, AND ISS WERE FOUND TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT PREDICTORS OF IN HOSPITAL MORTALITY AMONG GERIATRIC MOTOR VEHICLE TRAUMA PATIENTS.

HERE WE PRESENT RESULTS FROM A LARGE SCALE, OBSERVATIONAL, NONINTERVENTIONAL, PROSPECTIVE POSTLICENSURE STUDY THAT EVALUATED THE SAFETY OF MF59 ADJUVANTED VACCINE IN ELDERLY SUBJECTS AGED 65 YEARS OR MORE. THE STUDY WAS PERFORMED IN 5 NORTHERN ITALIAN HEALTH DISTRICTS DURING THE 2006 2007, 2007 2008, AND 2008 2009 INFLUENZA SEASONS. THE CHOICE OF VACCINE EITHER ADJUVANTED VACCINE OR A NONADJUVANTED INFLUENZA VACCINE WAS DETERMINED BY INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS ON THE BASIS OF LOCAL INFLUENZA VACCINATION POLICY. HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS OF SPECIAL INTEREST (AESIS) WERE IDENTIFIED FROM HOSPITAL DATABASES AND THEN REVIEWED AGAINST RECOGNIZED CASE DEFINITIONS TO IDENTIFY CONFIRMED CASES OF AESI. CUMULATIVE INCIDENCES WERE CALCULATED FOR AESIS IN PREDEFINED BIOLOGICALLY PLAUSIBLE TIME WINDOWS, AS WELL AS IN A 6 MONTH WINDOW FOLLOWING VACCINATION. DURING THE 3 YEAR STUDY PERIOD, 170,988 VACCINE DOSES WERE ADMINISTERED TO A TOTAL OF 107,661 PERSONS. DESPITE THE LARGE STUDY SIZE, CASES OF AESI RESULTING IN HOSPITALIZATION WERE RARE, AND RISKS OF AESI WERE SIMILAR IN BOTH THE MF59 ADJUVANTED AND NONADJUVANTED VACCINATION GROUPS. IN CONCLUSION, SIMILAR SAFETY PROFILES WERE OBSERVED FOR BOTH NONADJUVANTED AND MF59 ADJUVANTED SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINES IN ELDERLY RECIPIENTS.	***

SEVERAL CASE CONTROL STUDIES LINKED HOMOZYGOUS DELETION OF THE GLUTATHIONE S TRANSFERASE THETA (GSTT1) GENE TO AA; HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF GSTT1 DELETION REMAINS CONTROVERSIAL AS OTHER STUDIES FAILED TO CONFIRM THE ASSOCIATION. WE ASKED WHETHER A MORE PRECISE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GSTT1 NULL POLYMORPHISM AND APLASTIC ANEMIA COULD BE DEFINED USING A META ANALYSIS OF 609 APLASTIC ANEMIA PATIENTS, INCLUDING AN INDEPENDENT COHORT OF 67 PATIENTS FROM OUR INSTITUTION. WE SEARCHED PUBMED, EMBASE, AND THE COCHRANE DATABASE FOR STUDIES EVALUATING THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN GSTT1 NULL GENOTYPE AND DEVELOPMENT OF AA. SEVEN STUDIES, INVOLVING A TOTAL OF 609 PATIENTS AND 3,914 CONTROLS, FULFILLED THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA.

THE EFFECT WAS NOT DRIVEN BY ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL RESULT, NOR WAS THERE EVIDENCE OF SIGNIFICANT PUBLICATION BIAS. THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN AA AND GSTT1 DELETION SUGGESTS A ROLE OF GLUTATHIONE CONJUGATION IN AA, POSSIBLY THROUGH PROTECTING THE HEMATOPOIETIC COMPARTMENT FROM ENDOGENOUS METABOLITES OR ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES.

THE VAST MAJORITY OF SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES DEALING WITH NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS ADDRESS BACTERIAL OR FUNGAL INFECTIONS, AND VIRAL AGENTS ARE OFTEN DISREGARDED. THIS ANALYSIS REVIEWS THE MEDICAL LITERATURE IN AN EFFORT TO ESTABLISH THE INCIDENCE, TYPES OF PATHOGENS, AND CLINICAL FEATURES OF NONCONGENITAL NEONATAL VIRAL INFECTIONS. METHODS: THIS ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING THE WORLDWIDE DATABASE OF HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATED OUTBREAKS (HTTP://WWW.OUTBREAK DATABASE.COM). ITEMS ANALYZED INCLUDED CAUSATIVE PATHOGENS, TYPES OF INFECTION, SOURCE OF OUTBREAKS, AND MEASURES TAKEN TO STOP OUTBREAKS. RESULTS: THE OUTBREAK DATABASE CONTAINED A TOTAL OF 590 NEONATAL OUTBREAKS, OF WHICH 64 WERE ORIGINATED BY VIRUSES, 44 OF WHICH (68.75%) WERE REPORTED FROM NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNITS (NICUS). THE 5 MOST FREQUENT VIRAL AGENTS WERE ROTAVIRUS (23.44%), RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS (17.19%), ENTEROVIRUS (15.63%), HEPATITIS A VIRUS (10.94%), AND ADENOVIRUS (9.38%). CONCLUSION: OUR ANALYSIS OF THE VIRAL ORIGINS OF NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS IN NICUS CAN BE A VALUABLE TOOL IN THE INVESTIGATION OF NEONATAL INFECTIONS. THE MORTALITY RATES REPORTED IN THIS ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF NONCONGENITAL VIRAL INFECTIONS IN NICUS AND THE NEED FOR MORE EFFECTIVE OUTBREAK PREVENTION STRATEGIES.

UNDERSTANDING BIRD IMMUNITY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL IMPACT OF AVIAN INFECTIOUS DISEASES, BOTH IN THEIR ROLE AS FOOD ANIMALS AND AS POTENTIAL CARRIERS OF ZOONOTIC DISEASES IN MAN. THE ANTI INFLAMMATORY PROTEIN TRISTETRAPROLIN (TTP) IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE MAMMALIAN INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSE, IN THAT IT BINDS TO AND DESTABILIZES KEY CYTOKINE MRNAS. TTP KNOCKOUT MICE EXHIBIT A SEVERE SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATORY SYNDROME, AND THEY ARE ABNORMALLY SENSITIVE TO INNATE IMMUNE STIMULI SUCH AS LPS. TTP ORTHOLOGS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN MOST VERTEBRATES STUDIED, INCLUDING FROGS. HERE, WE ATTEMPTED TO IDENTIFY TTP ORTHOLOGS IN CHICKEN AND OTHER BIRDS, USING DATABASE SEARCHES AND DEEP MRNA SEQUENCING. ALTHOUGH SEQUENCES ENCODING THE TWO OTHER WIDELY EXPRESSED TTP FAMILY MEMBERS, ZFP36L1 AND ZFP36L2, WERE IDENTIFIED, WE DID NOT FIND SEQUENCES CORRESPONDING TO TTP IN ANY BIRD SPECIES. SEQUENCES CORRESPONDING TO TTP WERE IDENTIFIED IN BOTH LIZARDS AND ALLIGATORS, CLOSE EVOLUTIONARY RELATIVES OF BIRDS. THE INDUCTION KINETICS OF ZFP36L1 AND ZFP36L2 MRNAS IN LPS STIMULATED CHICKEN MACROPHAGES OR SERUM STIMULATED CHICK EMBRYO FIBROBLASTS DID NOT RESEMBLE THE NORMAL MAMMALIAN TTP RESPONSE TO THESE STIMULI, SUGGESTING THAT THE OTHER TWO FAMILY MEMBERS MIGHT NOT COMPENSATE FOR THE TTP DEFICIENCY IN REGULATING RAPIDLY INDUCED MRNA TARGETS. SEVERAL MAMMALIAN TTP TARGET TRANSCRIPTS HAVE CHICKEN COUNTERPARTS THAT CONTAIN ONE OR MORE POTENTIAL TTP BINDING SITES, RAISING THE POSSIBILITY THAT BIRDS EXPRESS OTHER PROTEINS THAT SUBSUME TTPS FUNCTION AS A RAPIDLY INDUCIBLE REGULATOR OF AU RICH ELEMENT (ARE) DEPENDENT MRNA TURNOVER.	***

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MATERNAL SMOKING AND BIPOLAR DISORDER IN OFFSPRING, WHICH INCLUDES EXTERNALIZING SYMPTOMS AMONG ITS MANY MANIFESTATIONS, HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED IN DEPTH. THE AUTHORS EXAMINED WHETHER OFFSPRING EXPOSED TO MATERNAL SMOKING IN UTERO WOULD BE AT INCREASED LIFETIME RISK FOR BIPOLAR DISORDER AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO MATERNAL SMOKING. METHOD: INDIVIDUALS WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER (N79) WERE ASCERTAINED FROM THE BIRTH COHORT OF THE CHILD HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT STUDY. CASE SUBJECTS WERE IDENTIFIED BY A COMBINATION OF CLINICAL, DATABASE, AND DIRECT MAILING SOURCES; ALL CASE SUBJECTS WERE DIRECTLY INTERVIEWED AND DIAGNOSED USING DSM IV CRITERIA. COMPARISON SUBJECTS (N654) WERE MATCHED TO CASE SUBJECTS ON DATE OF BIRTH (+/ 30 DAYS), SEX, MEMBERSHIP IN THE COHORT AT THE TIME OF ILLNESS ONSET, AND AVAILABILITY OF MATERNAL ARCHIVED SERA. RESULTS: AFTER ADJUSTING FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS, OFFSPRING EXPOSED TO IN UTERO MATERNAL SMOKING EXHIBITED A TWOFOLD GREATER RISK FOR BIPOLAR DISORDER (ODDS RATIO2.014, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL1.48 2.53, P0.01). THE ASSOCIATIONS WERE NOTED PRIMARILY AMONG BIPOLAR OFFSPRING WITHOUT PSYCHOTIC FEATURES. CONCLUSIONS: PRENATAL TOBACCO EXPOSURE MAY BE ONE SUSPECTED CAUSE OF BIPOLAR DISORDER. HOWEVER, IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR OTHER UNMEASURED FAMILIAL FACTORS BEFORE CAUSAL TERATOGENIC EFFECTS CAN BE SUGGESTED.	***

THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT EMPHASIS ON MENISCUS PRESERVATION, PARTICULARLY IN THE YOUNG PATIENT, TO REDUCE THE RISK OF ARTHRITIS. PURPOSE: TO REPORT ON THE INCIDENCE OF MENISCUS REPAIR AND MENISCECTOMY, WITH AND WITHOUT CONCOMITANT ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT (ACL) RECONSTRUCTION, IN THE UNITED STATES (US) OVER THE PAST 7 YEARS. STUDY DESIGN: DESCRIPTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGY STUDY. METHODS: PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT ARTHROSCOPIC MENISCECTOMY (CURRENT PROCEDURAL TERMINOLOGY [CPT] CODES 29880 AND 29881), MENISCUS REPAIR (CPT CODES 29882 AND 29883), AND ACL RECONSTRUCTION (CPT CODE 29888) FOR THE YEARS 2005 THROUGH 2011 WERE IDENTIFIED USING THE PEARLDIVER PATIENT RECORD DATABASE. AGE GROUP AND SEX WERE COLLECTED FOR EACH PATIENT. PATIENT GROUPS INCLUDED MENISCECTOMY ALONE, MENISCUS REPAIR ALONE, MENISCUS REPAIR FOLLOWED BY MENISCECTOMY, ACL RECONSTRUCTION WITH CONCOMITANT MENISCUS REPAIR, AND ACL RECONSTRUCTION WITH CONCOMITANT MENISCUS REPAIR FOLLOWED BY MENISCECTOMY. LINEAR REGRESSION AND STUDENT T TESTS WERE UTILIZED FOR COMPARISONS, WITH AN VALUE OF .05 SET AS SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS: THE DATABASE REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 9% OF THE US POPULATION UNDER 65 YEARS OF AGE. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS IN THE COVERED POPULATION DURING THE STUDY TIME FRAME (P .138). FROM 2005 TO 2011, THERE WERE A TOTAL OF 387,833 MENISCECTOMIES, 23,640 MENISCUS REPAIRS, AND 84,927 ACL RECONSTRUCTIONS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ISOLATED MENISCUS REPAIRS PERFORMED (P .001) AND A DOUBLING OF THE INCIDENCE OF REPAIRS FROM 2005 TO 2011. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF MENISCECTOMIES PERFORMED (P .712), WHILE THE INCIDENCE OF MENISCECTOMIES INCREASED ONLY 14% FROM 2005 TO 2011. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF MENISCUS REPAIRS PERFORMED AT THE SAME TIME AS ACL RECONSTRUCTION DURING THE STUDY TIME FRAME. THE TOTAL NUMBER AND INCIDENCE OF MENISCECTOMIES AFTER REPAIR WITH AND WITHOUT ACL RECONSTRUCTION SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED. CONCLUSION: THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASED NUMBER OF ISOLATED MENISCUS REPAIRS BEING PERFORMED IN THE US OVER THE PAST 7 YEARS WITHOUT A CONCOMITANT INCREASE IN MENISCECTOMIES OVER THE SAME TIME FRAME. THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT MENISCUS REPAIRS ARE PREFERENTIALLY BEING PERFORMED OVER MENISCECTOMIES.	***

BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2005 AND JUNE 30, 2010, 2352 KIDNEYS FROM 20KG DONORS WERE TRANSPLANTED INTO 1531 RECIPIENTS, 710 SINGLE KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS (SKTS) AND 821 EN BLOC KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS (EBKTS). INCREASED DONOR WEIGHT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER RATES OF RECOVERY, TRANSPLANTATION AND SKT. LOW DONOR WEIGHT (LINEAR P<0.001; QUADRATIC P0.003), SKT VERSUS EBKT (P0.008), INCREASED COLD ISCHEMIA TIME (P0.003), LOCAL VERSUS NONLOCAL DONOR (P0.0044), LOW VERSUS HIGH VOLUME CENTER (P0.003) AND THE INTERACTION TERM BETWEEN CENTER VOLUME AND DONOR WEIGHT (P0.0024) WERE ASSOCIATED WITH GRAFT FAILURE. NOTABLY, LOWER DONOR WEIGHT EXACERBATED THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF LOW CENTER VOLUME BUT DID NOT WORSEN THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF SKT ON OUTCOMES.

CONSENSUS GUIDELINES AND EXPERT OPINION SUGGEST THAT NONCARDIAC SURGERY IS A HIGH RISK EVENT, BUT FEW DATA DESCRIBE PERIOPERATIVE OUTCOMES IN THIS POPULATION. METHODS: BY USING THE NATIONWIDE INPATIENT SAMPLE DATABASE (YEARS 2002 THROUGH 2009), THE AUTHORS COMPARED PATIENTS WITH ADULT CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE (ACHD) WHO UNDERWENT NONCARDIAC SURGERY WITH A NON ACHD COMPARISON COHORT MATCHED ON AGE, SEX, RACE, YEAR, ELECTIVE OR URGENT OR EMERGENCY PROCEDURE, VAN WALRAVEN COMBORBIDITY SCORE, AND PRIMARY PROCEDURE CODE. MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY WERE COMPARED BETWEEN THE TWO COHORTS. RESULTS: A STUDY COHORT CONSISTING OF 10,004 ACHD PATIENTS WAS COMPARED WITH A MATCHED COMPARISON COHORT OF 37,581 PATIENTS. INPATIENT MORTALITY WAS GREATER IN THE ACHD COHORT (407 OF 10,004 [4.1 VS. 1,355 OF 37,581 [3.6; UNADJUSTED ODDS RATIO, 1.13; P 0.031; ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO, 1.29; P < 0.001). THE COMPOSITE ENDPOINT OF PERIOPERATIVE MORBIDITY WAS ALSO MORE COMMONLY OBSERVED IN THE ACHD COHORT (2,145 OF 10.004 [21.4 VS. 6,003 OF 37,581 [16.0; ODDS RATIO, 1.44; P < 0.001). ACHD PATIENTS COMPRISED AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF ALL NONCARDIAC SURGICAL ADMISSIONS OVER THE STUDY PERIOD (P VALUE FOR TREND IS <0.001), AND NONCARDIAC SURGERY REPRESENTED AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF ALL ACHD ADMISSIONS (P VALUE FOR TREND IS <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COMPARED WITH A MATCHED CONTROL COHORT, ACHD PATIENTS UNDERGOING NONCARDIAC SURGERY EXPERIENCED INCREASED PERIOPERATIVE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS OF A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF A LARGE ADMINISTRATIVE DATASET, THIS FINDING DEMONSTRATES THAT THIS IS A VULNERABLE POPULATION AND SUGGESTS THAT BETTER EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND AND IMPROVE THE PERIOPERATIVE CARE THEY RECEIVE.	***

THE AUTHORS ANALYZED PATIENT INJURIES RELATED TO GAS DELIVERY EQUIPMENT CLAIMS FROM THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTS CLOSED CLAIMS PROJECT DATABASE OVER THE DECADES FROM 1970S TO THE 2000S. METHODS: AFTER THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD APPROVAL, THE AUTHORS REVIEWED THE CLOSED CLAIMS PROJECT DATABASE OF 9,806 TOTAL CLAIMS. INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE GENERAL ANESTHESIA FOR SURGICAL OR OBSTETRIC ANESTHESIA CARE (N 6,022). ANESTHESIA GAS DELIVERY EQUIPMENT WAS DEFINED AS ANY DEVICE USED TO CONVEY GAS TO OR FROM (BUT NOT INVOLVING) THE AIRWAY MANAGEMENT DEVICE. CLAIMS RELATED TO ANESTHESIA GAS DELIVERY EQUIPMENT WERE COMPARED BETWEEN TIME PERIODS BY CHI SQUARE TEST, FISHER EXACT TEST, AND MANN WHITNEY U TEST. RESULTS: ANESTHESIA GAS DELIVERY CLAIMS DECREASED OVER THE DECADES (P < 0.001) TO 1% OF CLAIMS IN THE 2000S. OUTCOMES IN CLAIMS FROM 1990 TO 2011 (N 40) WERE LESS SEVERE, WITH A GREATER PROPORTION OF AWARENESS (N 9, 23%; P 0.003) AND PNEUMOTHORAX (N 7, 18%; P 0.047). SEVERE INJURIES (DEATH/PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE) OCCURRED IN SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN SUPPLY EVENTS OUTSIDE THE OPERATING ROOM, BREATHING CIRCUIT EVENTS, OR VENTILATOR MISHAPS.

METHODS: THIS GUIDELINE IS BASED ON PUBLISHED LITERATURE FROM 1966 TO SEPTEMBER 2010 THAT WAS IDENTIFIED BY USING MEDLINE, THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS, AND THE COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. A SUPPLEMENTAL MEDLINE SEARCH IDENTIFIED ADDITIONAL ARTICLES THROUGH OCTOBER 2012. SEARCHES WERE LIMITED TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE PUBLICATIONS. THE CLINICAL OUTCOMES EVALUATED FOR THIS GUIDELINE INCLUDED CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (SUCH AS HEART FAILURE, HYPERTENSION, STROKE, AND MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION), TYPE 2 DIABETES, DEATH, SLEEP STUDY MEASURES (SUCH AS THE APNEA HYPOPNEA INDEX), MEASURES OF CARDIOVASCULAR STATUS (SUCH AS BLOOD PRESSURE), MEASURES OF DIABETES STATUS (SUCH AS HEMOGLOBIN A(1C) LEVELS), AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THIS GUIDELINE GRADES THE EVIDENCE AND RECOMMENDATIONS USING ACPS CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES GRADING SYSTEM. RECOMMENDATION 1: ACP RECOMMENDS THAT ALL OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH OSA SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO LOSE WEIGHT. (GRADE: STRONG RECOMMENDATION; LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE) RECOMMENDATION 2: ACP RECOMMENDS CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE TREATMENT AS INITIAL THERAPY FOR PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH OSA. (GRADE: STRONG RECOMMENDATION; MODERATE QUALITY EVIDENCE) RECOMMENDATION 3: ACP RECOMMENDS MANDIBULAR ADVANCEMENT DEVICES AS AN ALTERNATIVE THERAPY TO CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH OSA WHO PREFER MANDIBULAR ADVANCEMENT DEVICES OR FOR THOSE WITH ADVERSE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE TREATMENT. (GRADE: WEAK RECOMMENDATION; LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE)	***

IN 2002, AA WAS DISCOVERED AT RELATIVELY HIGH CONCENTRATIONS IN SOME STARCHY, PLANT BASED FOODS COOKED AT HIGH TEMPERATURES. A PROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE DIETARY INTAKE OF AA AND DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE EXOCRINE PANCREATIC CANCER (PC) RISK IN THE EUROPEAN PROSPECTIVE INVESTIGATION INTO CANCER AND NUTRITION (EPIC) COHORT USING COX REGRESSION MODELING. EPIC INCLUDES > 500 000 MEN AND WOMEN AGED 35 75 AT ENROLLMENT FROM 10 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. AA INTAKE WAS ESTIMATED FOR EACH PARTICIPANT BY COMBINING QUESTIONNAIRE BASED FOOD CONSUMPTION DATA WITH A HARMONIZED AA DATABASE DERIVED FROM THE EU MONITORING DATABASE OF AA LEVELS IN FOODS, AND EVALUATED IN QUINTILES AND CONTINUOUSLY. AFTER A MEAN FOLLOW UP OF 11 YEARS, 865 FIRST INCIDENT ADENOCARCINOMAS OF THE EXOCRINE PANCREAS WERE OBSERVED AND INCLUDED IN THE PRESENT ANALYSIS. AT BASELINE, THE MEAN DIETARY AA INTAKE IN EPIC WAS 26.22 MU G/DAY. NO OVERALL ASSOCIATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN CONTINUOUS OR QUINTILES OF DIETARY AA INTAKE AND PC RISK IN EPIC (HR:0.95, 95%CI:0.89 1.01 PER 10 MU G/DAY). THERE WAS NO EFFECT MEASURE MODIFICATION BY SMOKING STATUS, SEX, DIABETES, ALCOHOL INTAKE OR GEOGRAPHIC REGION. HOWEVER, THERE WAS AN INVERSE ASSOCIATION (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.61 0.88 PER 10 MU G/DAY) BETWEEN AA INTAKE AND PC RISK IN OBESE PERSONS AS DEFINED USING THE BODY MASS INDEX (BMI, > 30 KG/M(2)), BUT NOT WHEN BODY FATNESS WAS DEFINED USING WAIST AND HIP CIRCUMFERENCE OR THEIR RATIO. DIETARY INTAKE OF AA WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF PC IN THE EPIC COHORT.	***

THE CURRENT GUIDELINES FOR FOLLOW UP CARE AFTER TREATMENT OF NON SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER RECOMMEND CONTINUED SURVEILLANCE FOR DETECTION OF RECURRENT OR METACHRONOUS DISEASE. HOWEVER, CARCINOID TUMORS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH A TYPICAL HISTOLOGIC PROFILE, TEND TO BE LESS AGGRESSIVE. OUR GOAL WAS TO DETERMINE THE PATTERNS OF RELAPSE AND THE MANNER OF DETECTION OF RECURRENCES, TO GUIDE FOLLOW UP CARE AFTER RESECTION. METHODS. PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT OPERATIONS FOR PULMONARY CARCINOIDS AT OUR INSTITUTION WERE IDENTIFIED FROM A PROSPECTIVELY MAINTAINED DATABASE, AND THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS WERE REVIEWED FOR RELAPSE PATTERNS, DETECTION METHODS, AND OUTCOMES. RESULTS. A TOTAL OF 337 PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT RESECTION BETWEEN 1993 AND 2010 WERE INCLUDED, WITH A MEDIAN FOLLOW UP TIME OF 3.5 YEARS. TYPICAL AND ATYPICAL CARCINOIDS WERE PRESENT IN 291 (86%) AND 46 (14%) PATIENTS, RESPECTIVELY. RECURRENCES OCCURRED IN 21 PATIENTS (6%), WITH DISTANT METASTASES IN 20 PATIENTS (95%) AND LOCOREGIONAL RECURRENCE IN ONLY 1 PATIENT. MOST RECURRENCES (15 [76) WERE NOT DETECTED THROUGH SCHEDULED SURVEILLANCE IMAGING BUT AFTER THE PRESENTATION OF SYMPTOMS (7 [33) OR INCIDENTALLY BY STUDIES PERFORMED FOR UNRELATED REASONS (8 [38). THE RISK OF RECURRENCE INCREASED WITH POSITIVE LYMPH NODES AND ATYPICAL HISTOLOGIC TYPE. ONLY 9 OF 291 PATIENTS (3%) WITH TYPICAL CARCINOIDS EXPERIENCED RECURRENCES, WITH A MEDIAN TIME TO RECURRENCE OF 4 YEARS (RANGE, 0.8 12 YEARS). CONVERSELY, 12 OF 46 PATIENTS (26%) WITH ATYPICAL CARCINOIDS EXPERIENCED RECURRENCES, WITH A MEDIAN TIME TO RECURRENCE OF 1.8 YEARS (RANGE, 0.2 7 YEARS). CONCLUSIONS. AFTER COMPLETE RESECTION, SCHEDULED SURVEILLANCE IMAGING FAILED TO DETECT MOST RECURRENCES. RECURRENCE WAS RARE IN PATIENTS WITH NODE NEGATIVE TYPICAL CARCINOIDS. GIVEN THE LOW RISK OF RECURRENCE AND THE UNCLEAR EFFICACY OF SURVEILLANCE IMAGING, ROUTINE SURVEILLANCE IMAGING MAY NOT BE WARRANTED IN THIS COHORT. (C) 2013 BY THE SOCIETY OF THORACIC SURGEONS	***

NONEXAMINATION OF LYMPH NODES IS AN EXTREME EXAMPLE OF THE VARIABILITY OF PATHOLOGIC NODAL STAGING OF NON SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER. WE COMPARED THE PREVALENCE, CHARACTERISTICS, AND SURVIVAL OF PATIENTS WITHOUT LYMPH NODES (PNX) TO PATIENTS WITH DOCUMENTED PATHOLOGIC N0 AND PATHOLOGIC N1 NON SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER. METHODS. A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS WAS DONE OF NON SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER RESECTIONS IN THE US SURVEILLANCE, EPIDEMIOLOGY, AND END RESULTS DATABASE FROM 1998 TO 2009. RESULTS. THIRTEEN PERCENT OF ALL RESECTIONS (18% OF NODE NEGATIVE RESECTIONS) WERE PNX, INCLUDING 6% OF ALL NODE NEGATIVE LOBAR OR GREATER RESECTIONS AND 51% OF SUBLOBAR RESECTIONS. THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF PNX RESECTIONS WERE LOBAR OR GREATER COMPARED WITH 90% OF PATHOLOGIC N0 (P < 0.0001). ADVANCED AGE AND SURGERY IN RURAL LOCATIONS WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH PNX RESECTION. THE MEDIAN DURATION OF SURVIVAL WAS 3 YEARS IN THE PNX COHORT, 6.4 YEARS IN THE N0 COHORT (P < 0.0001), AND 2.8 YEARS IN THE N1GROUP, WITH RESPECTIVE 5 YEAR SURVIVAL RATES OF 47%, 67%, AND 45% (P < 0.0001). THESE SURVIVAL DIFFERENCES REMAINED AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR POTENTIALLY CONFOUNDING FACTORS. CONCLUSIONS. PATIENTS WITH PNX RESECTIONS ARE A HIGH RISK SUBSET, WITH SURVIVAL APPROXIMATING PATHOLOGIC N1, NOT N0. THEY SHOULD HAVE FURTHER ATTEMPTS AT RETRIEVING LYMPH NODES FOR EXAMINATION OR BE OFFERED POSTOPERATIVE ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY. WE PREDICT THAT TREATMENT MODALITIES THAT FAIL TO ADDRESS LYMPH NODES ARE LIKELY TO YIELD INFERIOR SURVIVAL IN COMPARISON TO SURGERY WITH PROPER LYMPH NODE EXAMINATION. THE PROPORTION OF PNX LUNG RESECTIONS MAY BE A SENTINEL QUALITY INDICATOR FOR LUNG CANCER PROGRAMS. (C) 2013 BY THE SOCIETY OF THORACIC SURGEONS	***

SOFT TISSUE SARCOMA (STS) OF THE CHEST WALL IS UNCOMMON, AND OUR KNOWLEDGE IS LIMITED TO SMALL, SINGLE INSTITUTIONAL CASE SERIES. ALTHOUGH SOME SERIES HAVE EXAMINED PROGNOSTIC FACTORS FOR SURVIVAL WITH THIS RARE SET OF NEOPLASMS, OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PATTERNS OF RELAPSE IS LIMITED. METHODS. WE PERFORMED A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF A PROSPECTIVELY MAINTAINED DATABASE OF CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS TREATED FOR STS OF THE CHEST WALL. PREDICTORS OF SURVIVAL AND RECURRENCE WERE ANALYZED USING COX AND COMPETING RISK REGRESSION ANALYSES. RESULTS. FROM 1989 TO 2011, 192 PATIENTS UNDERWENT RESECTION FOR STS OF THE CHEST WALL. THE MOST COMMON HISTOPATHOLOGIC TYPE WAS DESMOID (33 [17), FOLLOWED BY UNDIFFERENTIATED PLEOMORPHIC SARCOMA (32 [16), LIPOSARCOMA (22 [11), AND MYXOFIBROSARCOMA (22 [11). THE MEDIAN FOLLOW UP WAS 50.9 MONTHS. THE 5 AND 10YEAR SURVIVAL RATES WERE 73% AND 61%, RESPECTIVELY. RECURRENCES OCCURRED IN 45 PATIENTS (23%): 17 DEVELOPED LOCAL RECURRENCES, AND 28 DEVELOPED DISTANT RECURRENCES. AMONG THE PATIENTS WHO DEVELOPED RECURRENCES, THE MEDIAN TIME TO EVENT WAS 11.6 MONTHS FOR LOCAL RECURRENCES AND 13.5 MONTHS FOR DISTANT RECURRENCES. THE MOST COMMON HISTOLOGIC TYPE AMONG RECURRENCES WAS UNDIFFERENTIATED PLEOMORPHIC SARCOMA (N [12), AND THE MOST COMMON SITE OF DISTANT RECURRENCES WAS LUNG (N 18). THE PRIMARY TREATMENT MODALITY FOR BOTH LOCAL AND DISTANT RECURRENCES WAS SURGICAL RESECTION; MEDIAN SURVIVAL AFTER RECURRENCE WAS 19.4 MONTHS. CONCLUSIONS. RECURRENCES OF STS ARE COMMON AFTER SURGICAL RESECTION. ALTHOUGH LOCAL OR DISTANT RECURRENCES CAN OCCUR SOON AFTER SURGERY, BOTH CAN OFTEN BE TREATED WITH RESECTION, PRODUCING REASONABLE OUTCOMES.

ESOPHAGECTOMY IS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY EXAMINED USE OF A MODIFIED FRAILTY INDEX AS A POTENTIAL PREDICTOR OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN ESOPHAGECTOMY PATIENTS. METHODS. NATIONAL SURGICAL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM PARTICIPANT USE FILES WERE REVIEWED FOR 2005 THROUGH 2010. PATIENTS UNDERGOING ESOPHAGECTOMY WERE SELECTED BASED ON CPT CODES. A MODIFIED FRAILTY INDEX WITH 11 VARIABLES WAS USED TO DETERMINE CORRELATION BETWEEN FRAILTY AND POSTESOPHAGECTOMY MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING CHI(2) TEST AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION. RESULTS. A TOTAL OF 2,095 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. HIGHER FRAILTY SCORES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. A FRAILTY SCORE OF 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, AND 5 HAD ASSOCIATED MORBIDITY RATES OF 17.9% (142 OF 795 PATIENTS), 25.1% (178 OF 710 PATIENTS), 31.4% (126 OF 401 PATIENTS), 34.4% (48 OF 140 PATIENTS), 44.4% (16 OF 36 PATIENTS), AND 61.5% (8 OF 13 PATIENTS), RESPECTIVELY. A FRAILTY SCORE OF 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, AND 5 HAD ASSOCIATED MORTALITY RATES OF 1.8% (14 OF 795 PATIENTS), 3.8% (27 OF 710 PATIENTS), 4% (16 OF 401 PATIENTS), 7.1% (10 OF 140 PATIENTS), 8.3% (3 OF 36 PATIENTS), AND 23.1% (3 OF 13 PATIENTS), RESPECTIVELY. WHEN USING MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION FOR MORTALITY COMPARING AGE, FUNCTIONAL STATUS, PREALBUMIN, EMERGENCY SURGERY, WOUND CLASS, AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTS SCORE, AND SEX, ONLY AGE AND FRAILTY WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. THE ODDS RATIO WAS 31.84 FOR FRAILTY (P 0.015) AND 1.05 (P 0.001) FOR AGE. CONCLUSIONS. USING A LARGE NATIONAL DATABASE, A MODIFIED FRAILTY INDEX WAS SHOWN TO CORRELATE WITH POSTESOPHAGECTOMY MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. SUCH AN INDEX MAY BE USED TO AID IN IMPROVING RISK ASSESSMENT AND PATIENT SELECTION FOR ESOPHAGECTOMY. 2013 BY THE SOCIETY OF THORACIC SURGEONS	***

THE AGE AND RISK PROFILE OF PATIENTS UNDERGOING ISOLATED CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING (CABG) IS INCREASING, WHICH WILL LIKELY INCREASE THE PROPORTION OF CABG PATIENTS DISCHARGED TO NURSING HOMES, REHABILITATION, OR LONG TERM CARE. BECAUSE DISCHARGE DISPOSITION CAN BE IMPORTANT TO A PATIENTS TREATMENT GOALS, DEVELOPING AND USING PREDICTIVE TOOLS WILL IMPROVE INFORMED TREATMENT DECISION MAKING. WE EXAMINED THE UTILITY OF THE SOCIETY OF THORACIC SURGEONS (STS) RISK OF MORTALITY SCORE IN PREDICTING DISCHARGE DISPOSITION AFTER CABG. METHODS. FROM JANUARY 1, 2004 TO OCTOBER 31, 2011, 5,119 PATIENTS UNDERWENT ISOLATED CABG AT THE HEART HOSPITAL BAYLOR PLANO OR BAYLOR UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER (TEXAS) AND WERE DISCHARGED ALIVE. THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN STS RISK OF MORTALITY AND DISCHARGE TO NURSING HOME, REHABILITATION, OR LONG TERM CARE WAS ASSESSED USING MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION, ADJUSTED FOR AGE, BODY SURFACE AREA, MARITAL STATUS, SITE, AND YEAR OF OPERATION. RESULTS. AT DISCHARGE, 216 PATIENTS (4.21%) WENT TO NURSING HOMES, 153 (2.99%) TO REHABILITATION, AND 115 (2.25%) TO LONG TERM CARE. THE STS RISK OF MORTALITY SCORE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH DISCHARGE STATUS (P < 0.001). PATIENTS WITH 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, AND 5% STS RISK OF MORTALITY HAD 11.25%, 22.10%, 29.45%, 35.00%, AND 38.50% PROBABILITY, RESPECTIVELY, OF NOT BEING DISCHARGED HOME. WHEN THE STS RISK OF MORTALITY WAS 5%, THE RISK OF NOT BEING DISCHARGED HOME WAS 47.9% FOR OFF PUMP PATIENTS AND 38.10% FOR ON PUMP PATIENTS. CONCLUSIONS. STS RISK SCORE IS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH CABG DISCHARGE STATUS. PATIENTS WITH A RISK SCORE EXCEEDING 2 ARE AT HIGH RISK (>22%) OF NOT BEING DISCHARGED HOME. THIS RISK SHOULD BE DISCUSSED WHEN TREATMENT DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE. (C) 2013 BY THE SOCIETY OF THORACIC SURGEONS	***

CIRRHOSIS SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTS MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN PATIENTS WHO UNDERGO COMPLEX SURGICAL PROCEDURES. HOWEVER, CIRRHOSIS IS NOT INCLUDED AS A PARAMETER IN STANDARDIZED PERIOPERATIVE CARDIAC RISK ASSESSMENT MODELS. WE SOUGHT TO IDENTIFY THE IMPACT OF CIRRHOSIS ON CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING (CABG) AND OFF PUMP CABG (OPCAB) OUTCOMES. METHODS. USING THE 1998 TO 2009 NATIONWIDE INPATIENT SAMPLE DATABASES, WE IDENTIFIED 3,046,709 PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT CABG PROCEDURES, 744,636 (24.4%) OF WHICH WERE OPCAB; 6,448 (0.3%) HAD CIRRHOSIS. USING HIERARCHICAL MULTIVARIABLE REGRESSION MODELS, WE ANALYZED THE IMPACT OF CIRRHOSIS ON IN HOSPITAL OUTCOMES: MORTALITY, MORBIDITY, LENGTH OF STAY, HOSPITAL CHARGES, AND DISPOSITION. SEVERITY OF LIVER DYSFUNCTION WAS ASSESSED BY THE DEYO CHARLSON COMORBIDITY INDEX. RESULTS. IN THE OVERALL CABG GROUP, CIRRHOSIS WAS INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED MORTALITY (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO [AOR] 6.9, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] 2.8 TO 17), MORBIDITY (AOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3 TO 2.0), LENGTH OF STAY (+1.2 DAYS; P < 0.001), AND HOSPITAL CHARGES (+$22,491; P < 0.001). THE PREVALENCE OF CIRRHOSIS IN THE OPCAB GROUP WAS 0.3% (N 2,246); THE OPCAB SUBGROUP ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE PRESENCE OF CIRRHOSIS DID NOT AFFECT MORTALITY OR MORBIDITY UNLESS THERE WAS SEVERE LIVER DYSFUNCTION (MORTALITY AOR 5.1, 95% CI 3.7 TO 6.9; MORBIDITY AOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.6 TO 2.4). HOWEVER, IN THE ON PUMP CABG PATIENTS, CIRRHOSIS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY REGARDLESS OF THE SEVERITY OF LIVER DYSFUNCTION. CONCLUSIONS. THE IMPACT OF CIRRHOSIS ON PERIOPERATIVE OUTCOMES AND HEALTH CARE COSTS IS SIGNIFICANT; CABG SHOULD BE PERFORMED ON CAREFULLY SELECTED CIRRHOTIC PATIENTS AND, WHENEVER POSSIBLE, WITHOUT THE USE OF CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS.

AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PATIENTS REQUIRING SURGICAL AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT (SAVR) PRESENT WITH CHRONIC PULMONARY OBSTRUCTIVE DISEASE (COPD). THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE PATIENTS WHO HAD A RANGE OF COPD FROM NORMAL TO SEVERE AND WERE UNDERGOING SAVR. METHODS. RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF 2,379 PATIENTS UNDERGOING SAVR +/ CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING (CABG) FROM JANUARY 2002 TO APRIL 2012 AT A US ACADEMIC INSTITUTION WAS PERFORMED. COPD WAS DEFINED ACCORDING TO THE SOCIETY OF THORACIC SURGEONS (STS) ADULT CARDIAC DATABASE: NORMAL (FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME [FEV] > 75% PREDICTED), MILD (FEV IN 1 SECOND [FEV1] 60% 75%), MODERATE (FEV1 50% 59%), AND SEVERE (FEV1 < 50%). MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC AND COX REGRESSION METHODS WERE USED TO DETERMINE INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN COPD AND SHORT AND LONG TERM OUTCOMES. SELECTION BIAS ADJUSTMENT WAS ACHIEVED USING THE STS PREDICTED RISK OF MORTALITY (PROM). ADJUSTED ODDS RATIOS (AORS) AND ADJUSTED HAZARD RATIOS (AHR) WERE CALCULATED USING THE NORMAL LUNG FUNCTION GROUP AS THE REFERENCE. KAPLAN MEIER CURVES WERE CREATED TO ESTIMATE LONG TERM SURVIVAL. RESULTS. ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN OF 2,379 PATIENTS (63.8%) HAD ISOLATED SAVR, WHEREAS 862 OF 2,379 (36.2%) PATIENTS UNDERWENT SAVR + CABG. PREOPERATIVE COPD WAS COMMON AMONG PATIENTS (21.9%) UNDERGOING SAVR +/ CABG AND INCLUDED 332 (14.0%) PATIENTS WITH MILD COPD, 89 (3.7%) PATIENTS WITH MODERATE COPD, AND 101 (4.2%) PATIENTS WITH SEVERE COPD. UNADJUSTED IN HOSPITAL MORTALITY ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY WITH COPD CLASS, FROM 3.9% FOR THOSE WITH NO COPD TO 9.6% TO PATIENTS WITH SEVERE COPD. AFTER ADJUSTMENT, IN HOSPITAL MORTALITY WAS NOT STATISTICALLY DIFFERENT IN NORMAL PATIENTS AND IN THOSE WITH COPD. IN CONTRAST, WHEN COMPARED WITH NORMAL PATIENTS, ADJUSTED LONG TERM SURVIVAL WAS WORSE ACROSS LEVELS OF COPD: MILD (AHR, 1.70; P < 0.001), MODERATE (AHR, 2.25; P < 0.001), AND SEVERE (AHR, 2.28; P < 0.001).

THE INCIDENCE OF REOPERATIVE MITRAL VALVE (MV) SURGICAL PROCEDURES IS INCREASING, REPRESENTING MORE THAN 10% OF ALL MV OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. PREVIOUS CLINICAL SERIES HAVE REPORTED MORTALITY RATES OF 5% TO 18% AND REENTRY INJURY RATES OF 5% TO 10% FOR REOPERATIVE MV OPERATIONS. METHODS. BETWEEN JANUARY 2004 AND JUNE 2012, 1,312 MV OPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED ON 1,275 PATIENTS. WE EXCLUDED 234 PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT SMALL INCISION PRIMARY RIGHT THORACOTOMY, 11 REDO OPERATIONS WITH FIRST OR SECOND OPERATION OTHER THAN STERNOTOMY, AND 10 EMERGENT OPERATIONS, LEAVING 1,056 MV OPERATIONS FOR ANALYSIS (FIRST TIME STERNOTOMY, 926 [88; REPEAT STERNOTOMY, 130 (12). PREOPERATIVE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY WAS PERFORMED FOR ALL REPEAT STERNOTOMY PATIENTS. PATIENTS AT RISK FOR REENTRY INJURY WERE IDENTIFIED, AND PROTECTIVE STRATEGIES WERE APPLIED SYSTEMICALLY BEFORE RESTERNOTOMY PROCEDURES. RESULTS. AMONG 130 PATIENTS UNDERGOING REOPERATIVE MV OPERATIONS, 35% (46/130) HAD PRIOR CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING (CABG), 15% (19/130) AORTIC VALVE OPERATIONS, AND 61% (80/130) MV OPERATIONS. SIXTEEN PERCENT (21/130) HAD MORE THAN ONE PREVIOUS STERNOTOMY. OPERATIVE MORTALITY WAS 4.6% (43/926) FOR FIRST TIME PROCEDURES AND 4.6% (6/130) FOR REOPERATIVE MV OPERATIONS. INTRAOPERATIVE INJURY (INNOMINATE VEIN) OCCURRED DURING REPEAT STERNOTOMY IN 2 (1.5%) PATIENTS. STROKE OCCURRED IN 3 PATIENTS (2%) WHO UNDERWENT REPEAT STERNOTOMY AND IN 22 (2%) WHO UNDERWENT FIRST TIME STERNOTOMY. ON MULTIVARIABLE ANALYSIS, PREOPERATIVE NEW YORK HEART ASSOCIATION FUNCTION CLASS, CONCOMITANT CABG, DIALYSIS, AND HIGHER PULMONARY ARTERY PRESSURES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATIVE MORTALITY, AND REPEAT STERNOTOMY WAS NOT. CONCLUSIONS. WITH CAREFUL PLANNING AND EXECUTION, OUTCOMES FOR REOPERATIVE MV OPERATIONS IN CONTEMPORARY PRACTICE ARE FAVORABLE AND ARE IDENTICAL WITH THOSE FOR FIRST TIME OPERATIONS.

TRICUSPID VALVE (TV) INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS (IE) ACCOUNTS FOR 15% OF IE CASES AND USUALLY IS TREATED MEDICALLY. SURGICAL INTERVENTION IS RARE, AND UNDERSTANDING OF TREATMENT OPTIONS IS BASED ON SMALL SERIES OF PATIENTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DESCRIBE THE POPULATION AND OUTCOMES FOR ISOLATED TV IE USING THE SOCIETY OF THORACIC SURGEONS ADULT CARDIAC DATABASE. METHODS. BETWEEN 2002 AND 2009, 910 OPERATIONS FOR TV IE WERE PERFORMED. PROCEDURES INCLUDED REPLACEMENT, REPAIR, AND VALVECTOMY. HEALED IE WAS PRESENT IN 31.4% (N 286), AND ACTIVE IE, IN 68.5% (N 624). BASELINE PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL AS OPERATIVE MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY WERE ANALYZED, AND UNIVARIATE STATISTICAL DIFFERENCES WERE EVALUATED BY KRUSKAL WALLIS TEST AND STRATUM ADJUSTED MANTEL HAENSZEL CHI(2) TESTS. RESULTS. THE MEDIAN AGE WAS 40 YEARS, WITH 50.6% MALE. REPLACEMENT OF THE TV WAS THE MOST COMMON PROCEDURE (N 490; 53.8%), FOLLOWED BY TV REPAIR (N 354; 38.9%) AND VALVECTOMY (N 66; 7.2%). OVERALL OPERATIVE MORTALITY WAS 7.3%, WITH NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN MORTALITY AMONG VALVECTOMY 12%, REPAIR 7.6%, AND REPLACEMENT 6.3% (P 0.34). COMPARED WITH THE ACTIVE GROUP, HEALED PATIENTS EXPERIENCED A TREND TOWARD LOWER OPERATIVE MORTALITY (4.2% VERSUS 8.6%; P 0.06), LOWER COMPLICATION RATES (35.6% VERSUS 51.4%; P 0.0004), AND SHORTER OVERALL LENGTH OF STAY (12 VERSUS 22 DAYS; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. ISOLATED TV OPERATION FOR IE IS A RARE CLINICAL ENTITY WITH A SIMILAR OPERATIVE MORTALITY TO LEFT SIDED IE OPERATIONS. REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT OF THE TV HAD SIMILAR PERIOPERATIVE MORTALITY. PATIENTS IN THE HEALED TV IE GROUP DEMONSTRATED LOWER COMPLICATION RATES, LENGTH OF STAY, AND A TREND TOWARD DECREASED MORTALITY.

VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICES (VADS) HAVE BEEN USED WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY TO BRIDGE SMALL CHILDREN TO HEART TRANSPLANTATION (HTX), BUT OUTCOMES IN LARGE COHORTS ARE NOT WELL ESTABLISHED. METHODS. SMALL CHILDREN (< 10 KG) BRIDGED TO HTX WITH VADS BETWEEN 2004 AND 2010 WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE UNITED NETWORK FOR ORGAN SHARING DATABASE. SURVIVAL WAS MODELED USING THE KAPLAN MEIER METHOD, AND 2: 1 PROPENSITY MATCHING WAS USED TO COMPARE OUTCOMES WITH A WELL MATCHED CONTROL COHORT OF NONBRIDGED HTX RECIPIENTS. RESULTS. OF THE 803 SMALL CHILDREN WHO UNDERWENT HTX DURING THE STUDY PERIOD, 59 (7%) WERE BRIDGED WITH A VAD. THE PROPORTION OF RECIPIENTS THAT WERE BRIDGED WITH A VAD INCREASED FROM 3% IN 2004 TO 9% IN 2010 (P 0.03). KAPLAN MEIER 30 DAY, 6 MONTH, AND 1 YEAR SURVIVAL WAS COMPARABLE BETWEEN THOSE BRIDGED WITH A VAD AND 118 WELL MATCHED NONBRIDGED CHILDREN. RATES OF POSTOPERATIVE RENAL FAILURE, REOPERATION, INFECTION, AND REJECTION WERE ALSO COMPARABLE. THOSE BRIDGED WITH A VAD HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATE OF POSTOPERATIVE STROKE (8.5% VS 0.9%; P 0.008). CONCLUSIONS. SMALL CHILDREN BRIDGED TO HTX WITH A VAD HAVE EARLY SURVIVAL RATES THAT ARE COMPARABLE TO NONBRIDGED CHILDREN; HOWEVER, THIS IS ACHIEVED AT THE EXPENSE OF A HIGHER RATE OF STROKE. IDENTIFYING THE RISK FACTORS FOR EARLY DEATH AND STROKE IN SMALL CHILDREN BRIDGED TO HTX WITH VADS IS PRUDENT AS MORE EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PATIENT POPULATION ACCUMULATES.

THE FOURIER DOMAIN IS WIDELY USED IN CS APPLICATIONS DUE TO ITS INHERENT PROPERTIES. SPARSE SIGNAL RECOVERY APPLICATIONS USING A SMALL NUMBER OF FOURIER TRANSFORM COEFFICIENTS HAVE MADE SOLUTIONS TO LARGE SCALE DATA RECOVERY PROBLEMS, INCLUDING IMAGE RECOVERY PROBLEMS, MORE PRACTICAL. THE SPARSE RECONSTRUCTION OF 2D IMAGES IS PERFORMED USING THE SAMPLING PATTERNS GENERATED BY TAKING THE GENERAL FREQUENCY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE IMAGES INTO ACCOUNT. IN THIS WORK, INSTEAD OF FORMING A GENERAL SAMPLING PATTERN FOR INFRARED (IR) IMAGES, A SPECIAL SAMPLING PATTERN IS OBTAINED BY GATHERING A DATABASE TO EXTRACT THE FREQUENCY CHARACTERISTICS OF IR SEA SURVEILLANCE IMAGES. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED SAMPLING PATTERN PROVIDES BETTER SPARSE RECOVERY RESULTS COMPARED TO THE WIDELY USED PATTERNS PROPOSED IN THE LITERATURE. IT IS ALSO SHOWN THAT, TOGETHER WITH A CERTAIN IMAGE DATASET, THE SAMPLING PATTERN GENERATED BY THE PROPOSED SCHEME CAN BE GENERALIZED FOR VARIOUS IMAGE SPARSE RECOVERY APPLICATIONS.

THEY ARE SUBDIVIDED INTO GENOGROUPS, EACH OF WHICH FURTHER SEGREGATES INTO GENOTYPES. UNTIL RECENTLY, A NEW GENOTYPE WAS BASED ON A DEFINED PAIRWISE DISTANCE CUTOFF OF COMPLETE VP1 SEQUENCES, BUT WITH THE INCREASING NUMBER OF AVAILABLE NOROVIRUS SEQUENCES, THIS CUTOFF IS NO LONGER ACCURATE, AND SEQUENCES IN THE PUBLIC DATABASE HAVE BEEN MISCLASSIFIED. IN THIS PAPER, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PAIRWISE DISTANCE CUTOFF METHOD CAN NO LONGER BE USED AND OUTLINE A PHYLOGENETIC APPROACH TO CLASSIFY NOROVIRUSES. FURTHERMORE, WE PROPOSE A DUAL NOMENCLATURE USING BOTH ORF1 AND VP1 SEQUENCES, AS RECOMBINATION IS COMMON AND RECOGNIZING RECOMBINANT VIRUSES MAY BE RELEVANT. WITH THE CONTINUING EMERGENCE OF NEW NOROVIRUS LINEAGES, WE PROPOSE TO COORDINATE NOMENCLATURE OF NEW NOROVIRUS GENOTYPES THROUGH AN INTERNATIONAL NOROVIRUS WORKING GROUP.	***

HEALTH ADMINISTRATIVE DATA CAN BE A VALUABLE TOOL FOR DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND RESEARCH. FEW STUDIES HAVE RIGOROUSLY EVALUATED THE ACCURACY OF ADMINISTRATIVE DATABASES FOR IDENTIFYING RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) PATIENTS. OUR AIM WAS TO VALIDATE ADMINISTRATIVE DATA ALGORITHMS TO IDENTIFY RA PATIENTS IN ONTARIO, CANADA. METHODS. WE PERFORMED A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF A RANDOM SAMPLE OF 450 PATIENTS FROM 18 RHEUMATOLOGY CLINICS. USING RHEUMATOLOGIST REPORTED DIAGNOSIS AS THE REFERENCE STANDARD, WE TESTED AND VALIDATED DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF PHYSICIAN BILLING, HOSPITALIZATION, AND PHARMACY DATA. RESULTS. ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE RHEUMATOLOGY PATIENTS WERE CLASSIFIED AS HAVING RA AND 301 WERE CLASSIFIED AS NOT HAVING RA BASED ON OUR REFERENCE STANDARD DEFINITION (STUDY RA PREVALENCE 33%). OVERALL, ALGORITHMS THAT INCLUDED PHYSICIAN BILLINGS HAD EXCELLENT SENSITIVITY (RANGE 94 100%). SPECIFICITY AND POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE (PPV) WERE MODEST TO EXCELLENT AND INCREASED WHEN ALGORITHMS INCLUDED MULTIPLE PHYSICIAN CLAIMS OR SPECIALIST CLAIMS. THE ADDITION OF RA MEDICATIONS DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE ALGORITHM PERFORMANCE. THE ALGORITHM OF (1 HOSPITALIZATION RA CODE EVER) OR (3 PHYSICIAN RA DIAGNOSIS CODES [CLAIMS] WITH 1 BY A SPECIALIST IN A 2 YEAR PERIOD) HAD A SENSITIVITY OF 97%, SPECIFICITY OF 85%, PPV OF 76%, AND NEGATIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF 98%. MOST RA PATIENTS (84%) HAD AN RA DIAGNOSIS CODE PRESENT IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE DATA WITHIN 1 YEAR OF A RHEUMATOLOGISTS DOCUMENTED DIAGNOSIS DATE. CONCLUSION. WE DEMONSTRATED THAT ADMINISTRATIVE DATA CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY RA PATIENTS WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF ACCURACY. RA DIAGNOSIS DATE AND DISEASE DURATION ARE FAIRLY WELL ESTIMATED FROM ADMINISTRATIVE DATA IN JURISDICTIONS OF UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE INSURANCE.	***

RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) IS ASSOCIATED WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD), BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT ITS ASSOCIATION WITH ANOTHER FORM OF VASCULAR DISORDER, VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM (VTE). METHODS. A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED USING US INSURANCE CLAIMS. RA AND NON RA PATIENTS WERE MATCHED ON AGE, SEX, AND INDEX DATE. INCIDENCE RATES (IRS) AND RATE RATIOS (RRS) OF VTE, DEFINED AS THE COMPOSITE OF DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (DVT) OR PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), WERE CALCULATED. COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODELS COMPARED VTE RISKS BETWEEN RA AND NON RA PATIENTS, ADJUSTING FOR VTE RISK FACTORS SUCH AS CVD, SURGERY, HOSPITALIZATION, MEDICATIONS, AND ACUTE PHASE REACTANTS. RESULTS. OVER THE MEAN FOLLOWUP OF 2 YEARS, THE IR FOR VTE AMONG RA PATIENTS WAS 6.1 PER 1,000 PERSON YEARS, 2.4 TIMES HIGHER (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [95% CI] 2.1 2.8) THAN THE RATE OF NON RA PATIENTS. THE IRS FOR BOTH DVT (RR 2.2, 95% CI 1.9 2.6) AND PE (RR 2.7, 95% CI 2.2 3.5) WERE HIGHER IN RA PATIENTS COMPARED WITH NON RA PATIENTS. AFTER ADJUSTING FOR RISK FACTORS OF VTE, THE VTE RISK REMAINED ELEVATED IN RA PATIENTS (HAZARD RATIO 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 1.7) COMPARED TO NON RA PATIENTS. THE RESULT WAS SIMILAR AFTER FURTHER ADJUSTMENT FOR ELEVATED ACUTE PHASE REACTANTS (HAZARD RATIO 1.5, 95% CI 0.3 6.5). ONE THIRD OF PATIENTS WHO DEVELOPED VTE HAD AT LEAST 1 MAJOR VTE RISK FACTOR 90 DAYS BEFORE AND AFTER THE VTE EVENT. CONCLUSION. OUR RESULTS SHOWED AN INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING VTE FOR RA PATIENTS COMPARED WITH NON RA PATIENTS. THE RISK WAS ATTENUATED BUT REMAINED ELEVATED EVEN AFTER ADJUSTING FOR VARIOUS RISK FACTORS FOR VTE.	***

TO IDENTIFY WHICH GAIT DEVIATIONS ARE CONSISTENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS (KOA) AND HOW THESE ARE INFLUENCED BY DISEASE SEVERITY, THE INVOLVED COMPARTMENT, AND SEX. METHODS. FIVE ELECTRONIC DATABASES AND REFERENCE LISTS OF PUBLICATIONS WERE SEARCHED. CROSS SECTIONAL, OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES COMPARING TEMPOROSPATIAL VARIABLES, JOINT KINEMATICS, AND JOINT MOMENTS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WITH KOA AND HEALTHY CONTROLS OR BETWEEN KOA SUBGROUPS WERE CONSIDERED FOR REVIEW. ONLY PUBLICATIONS SCORING 50% ON A MODIFIED METHODOLOGY QUALITY INDEX WERE INCLUDED. BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF GAIT DEVIATIONS EXAMINED, ONLY BIOMECHANICAL VARIABLES REPORTED BY 4 PUBLICATIONS WERE FURTHER ANALYZED. WHERE POSSIBLE, A META ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING EFFECT SIZES (ES) CALCULATED FROM DISCRETE VARIABLES. RESULTS. IN TOTAL, 41 PUBLICATIONS EXAMINING 20 VARIABLES WERE INCLUDED. THE MAJORITY OF CONSISTENT GAIT DEVIATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH KOA WERE EXHIBITED BY THOSE WITH SEVERE DISEASE IN THE TEMPOROSPATIAL DOMAIN. INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE KOA EXHIBITED GREATER STRIDE DURATION THAN CONTROLS (ES 1.35 [95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (95% CI) 1.03, 1.67]) AND A DECREASE IN CADENCE (ES 0.75 [95% CI 1.12, 0.39]) COMPARED WITH CONTROLS. THE EVIDENCE FOR KINEMATIC AND JOINT MOMENT CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY LIMITED OR CONFLICTING. THERE WAS A LACK OF EVIDENCE FOR ALTERATIONS IN THE EXTERNAL KNEE ADDUCTION MOMENT. CONCLUSION. INDIVIDUALS WITH KOA EXHIBIT A RANGE OF GAIT DEVIATIONS COMPARED WITH CONTROLS. DESPITE ITS COMMON USAGE IN KOA GAIT STUDIES, WE DID NOT FIND CONSISTENT EVIDENCE THAT KNEE ADDUCTION MOMENT DIFFERS BETWEEN THOSE WITH AND WITHOUT KOA OR BETWEEN DISEASE SEVERITY LEVELS. FURTHER RESEARCH EXAMINING THE REASONS FOR A LACK OF DIFFERENCE IN MANY GAIT VARIABLES IN THOSE WITH KNEE OA IS NEEDED.	***

TO DETERMINE THE INCIDENCE RATES AND RISK FACTORS OF CERVICAL AND TROCHANTERIC HIP FRACTURES (HFS) AMONG PATIENTS WITH SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE) BASED ON A NATIONWIDE POPULATION BASED DATA SET. METHODS. WE CONDUCTED A COHORT STUDY USING DATA FROM THE TAIWAN NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE DATABASE. PATIENTS WITH SLE AND THEIR AGE AND SEX MATCHED COUNTERPARTS WITHOUT SLE WERE IDENTIFIED. THE PRIMARY END POINT WAS THE FIRST OCCURRENCE OF HF. COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL WAS USED TO EVALUATE THE RESPECTIVE RISK FACTORS OF CERVICAL AND TROCHANTERIC HFS IN THE LUPUS COHORT. RESULTS. AMONG 14,544 PATIENTS WITH SLE (90% WOMEN, MEAN AGE 38.1 YEARS) WITH A MEAN FOLLOWUP OF 6 YEARS, 75 DEVELOPED HF (INCIDENCE RATE 8.60 PER 10,000 PERSON YEARS). COMPARED TO CONTROLS, THE INCIDENCE RATE RATIOS (IRRS) FOR DEVELOPING HF AMONG LUPUS PATIENTS WERE 3.17 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [95% CI] 1.92 5.39, P < 0.001) FOR CERVICAL HF AND 1.11 (95% CI 0.58 2.11, P 0.571) FOR TROCHANTERIC HF. THE IRRS FOR HF WERE 2.38 (95% CI 1.58 3.63, P < 0.001) FOR WOMEN AND 1.06 (95% CI 0.21 4.93, P 0.922) FOR MEN. LUPUS PATIENTS WITH CERVICAL HF WERE YOUNGER THAN CONTROLS WITH CERVICAL HF (MEAN AGE 56.7 VERSUS 67.8 YEARS; P 0.007). MULTIVARIABLE COX REGRESSION ANALYSES SHOWED THAT AGE, USE OF INTRAVENOUS CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, HIGHER DOSE OF STEROID, AND STROKE WERE ASSOCIATED WITH CERVICAL HF, WHEREAS AGE WAS THE ONLY ASSOCIATED FACTOR FOR TROCHANTERIC HF. CONCLUSION. SLE IS ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGHER RISK FOR CERVICAL BUT NOT TROCHANTERIC HF, AND THESE 2 TYPES OF HFS HAVE DIFFERENT RISK FACTORS.	***

TREAT TO TARGET (T2T) RECOMMENDATIONS SUGGEST THAT RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) PATIENTS SHOULD STRIVE FOR REMISSION OR LOW DISEASE ACTIVITY (LDA). HOWEVER, IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER PATIENTS EXPERIENCING A GOOD RESPONSE TO BIOLOGIC AGENTS MIGHT EXPERIENCE FURTHER IMPROVEMENT IN PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES (PROS) IF THEY SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVE A LOWER DISEASE ACTIVITY STATE, PARTICULARLY THE T2T GOALS OF LDA OR REMISSION. METHODS. USING THE CONSORTIUM OF RHEUMATOLOGY RESEARCHERS OF NORTH AMERICA DATABASE, WE IDENTIFIED RA PATIENTS INITIATING BIOLOGIC AGENTS. WE RESTRICTED THE ANALYSIS TO PATIENTS WITH IMPROVEMENT (CLINICAL DISEASE ACTIVITY INDEX [CDAI] IMPROVEMENT OF 10 UNITS) AT 3 6 MONTHS (BASELINE VISIT; N 1,368) WITH A FOLLOWUP VISIT APPROXIMATELY 9 MONTHS LATER (N 984). PATIENTS IN CDAI REMISSION OR WITH A WORSENED DISEASE ACTIVITY CATEGORY WERE EXCLUDED, LEAVING 562 ELIGIBLE PATIENTS. PROS (GLOBAL ASSESSMENT, PAIN, AND FATIGUE BY 0 10 VISUAL ANALOG SCALES AND DISABILITY BY THE MODIFIED HEALTH ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE [M HAQ]) WERE EXAMINED AT THESE 2 VISITS. MEAN CHANGE IN PROS COMPARED ACHIEVEMENT OF A LOWER DISEASE ACTIVITY CATEGORY VERSUS STAYING IN THE SAME DISEASE ACTIVITY CATEGORY, ADJUSTING FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS. RESULTS. PATIENTS WHO ACHIEVED A LOWER DISEASE ACTIVITY CATEGORY (40% OF THE ELIGIBLE COHORT, 86% OF THESE ACHIEVING LDA OR REMISSION) HAD SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN PATIENT PAIN ( 14.9; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [95% CI] 18.4, 11.6), PATIENT GLOBAL ( 17.5; 95% CI 20.8, 14.3), FATIGUE ( 8.5; 95% CI 15.8, 1.3), AND M HAQ SCORE ( 0.13; 95% CI 0.18, 0.08) COMPARED TO PATIENTS WHO STAYED IN THE SAME DISEASE ACTIVITY CATEGORY. HOWEVER, EVEN FOR PATIENTS IMPROVING, FEWER THAN HALF EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE FOR EACH PRO. CONCLUSION. ACHIEVEMENT OF A LOWER DISEASE ACTIVITY DISEASE STATE, ESPECIALLY T2T GOALS, WAS ASSOCIATED WITH FURTHER IMPROVEMENT IN PROS, ALBEIT MODEST IN MAGNITUDE.	***

METHOD: THE DATABASES MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, EMBASE AND SCOPUS WERE SEARCHED. STUDIES WERE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE INPATIENTS WITH LONG TERM, TREATMENT RESISTANT SCHIZOPHRENIA ON MAINTENANCE AP. THE SEARCH WAS RESTRICTED TO SYSTEMATIC REVIEW STUDIES. RESULTS: THE REVIEW YIELDED FOUR STUDIES OF INTEREST THAT SHOWED NO CATEGORICAL ADVANTAGE FOR MAINTENANCE AP FOR THE POPULATION OF INTEREST. HOWEVER, CLOZAPINE COMBINATION FAIRED MARGINALLY WELL. PARTICULAR WEAKNESSES OF THE PRESENT LITERATURE ARE LOW NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS, AND INADEQUATE MONITORING OF POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS. THE EVIDENCE ON THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF MAINTENANCE AP IS NOT GENERALLY CONSIDERED ADEQUATE TO WARRANT A RECOMMENDATION FOR ITS USE IN ROUTINE CLINICAL PRACTICE IN PSYCHIATRY. CONCLUSIONS: THIS REVIEW PROVIDES A SYNTHESIS OF THE EVIDENCE ON THE MAINTENANCE USE OF AP FOR HOSPITALISED PATIENTS WITH LONG TERM, TREATMENT RESISTANT SCHIZOPHRENIA. THE RESULTS SHOW BOTH NO SUPPORT FOR AP WITH SOME MARGINAL BENEFIT FOR CLOZAPINE COMBINATION THERAPY, AND METHODOLOGICAL WEAKNESSES OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. THESE FINDINGS HAVE CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR TREATMENT DECISIONS AND SUGGEST THAT SUFFICIENTLY POWERED STUDIES ARE NEEDED.	***

METHODS: I) RETROSPECTIVE RECORD REVIEW OF ALL HISTORIES OF PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED HBV IMMUNOGLOBULIN (HBIG) AT THE ALFRED BETWEEN 1/1/2007 AND 30/9/2011. II) ANALYSIS OF HBV SEROLOGICAL RESULTS OF MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN (MSM) ON VICTORIAN NPEP SERVICE (VNPEPS) DATABASE BETWEEN 10/8/2005 AND 31/12/2011. III) LITERATURE REVIEW TO DETERMINE RISKS OF HBV TRANSMISSION AND BEST PRACTICE FOR PREVENTION OF HBV TRANSMISSION. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 48 PATIENTS WERE POTENTIALLY EXPOSED TO HBV AND GIVEN HBIG, WITH SEXUAL EXPOSURE THE MOST COMMON INDICATION (N20). THE SOURCE WAS REPORTED TO BE HBSAG POSITIVE IN ONE CASE ONLY. OF THE MSM ON THE VNPEPS DATABASE, 63% WERE IMMUNE TO HBV, AND ONLY 0.5% OF PATIENTS TESTED HAD EVIDENCE OF CHRONIC HBV INFECTION. THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR USE OF HBIG IN THE AUSTRALIAN IMMUNISATION GUIDELINES ARE AMBIGUOUS AND DIFFER FROM OTHER INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES. CONCLUSION: THIS AUDIT AT A TERTIARY REFERRAL HOSPITAL IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF THOSE POTENTIALLY EXPOSED TO HBV. IN THOSE NON IMMUNE PATIENTS EXPOSED TO HBV, THE COMBINATION OF HBIG PLUS VACCINATION PROVIDES THE BEST PROTECTION AGAINST INFECTION. THE RISK OF TRANSMISSION OF HBV IS HIGHLY VARIABLE; RATES OF CHRONIC HBV IN PWID AND MSM IN AUSTRALIA ARE LOW AND DO NOT WARRANT USE OF HBIG UNLESS THE SOURCE IS KNOWN TO BE HBSAG POSITIVE.	***

IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR PHYSICAL HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBJECTIVE WELL BEING AND LIMITATIONS ON OCCUPATIONAL PARTICIPATION. WITH ITS FOCUS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OCCUPATION, HEALTH AND WELL BEING, OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY WOULD APPEAR TO BE WELL PLACED TO ADDRESS BOTH THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF OBESITY. THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO EXPLORE THE SCOPE OF THE ROLE OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY PRACTICE IN THIS FIELD AND THE SUPPORTING EVIDENCE BASE. METHODSSEARCHES WERE CONDUCTED IN FOUR ONLINE DATABASES AND NINE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY JOURNALS. ARTICLES WERE INCLUDED IF THEY WERE THEORETICAL, QUANTITATIVE OR QUALITATIVE RESEARCH, EXPLICITLY RELATED TO OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY AND OBESITY, PUBLISHED IN PEER REVIEWED JOURNALS, IN ENGLISH BETWEEN 2002 AND 2012. ALL RESEARCH ARTICLES WERE CRITICALLY REVIEWED AND THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED ACROSS ALL OF THE ARTICLES IN THE REVIEW. RESULTSEIGHT THEORETICAL ARTICLES, 12 QUANTITATIVE AND TWO QUALITATIVE RESEARCH STUDIES WERE INCLUDED. ONLY THREE WERE OUTCOME STUDIES. THEMATIC ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED FOUR CATEGORIES OF FOCUS OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY INTERVENTION: HEALTH PROMOTION AND PREVENTION, INCREASING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PARTICIPATION, MODIFYING DIETARY INTAKE AND REDUCING THE IMPACT OF OBESITY. FOUR CATEGORIES OF INTERVENTION STRATEGIES WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED; ASSESSMENT, MODIFYING THE ENVIRONMENT, EDUCATION AND INTRODUCING AND ADAPTING OCCUPATIONS. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCETHE FINDINGS OF THIS REVIEW SUGGEST A COMPREHENSIVE ROLE FOR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY IN ADDRESSING OBESITY.

CURRENT SCHEMES FOR MONITORING METABOLISM RELY ON OFFLINE MEASUREMENTS OF SAMPLES OF THE EXTRACELLULAR MEDIUM. HOWEVER, IN THE ERA OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY, IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT BIOSENSORS THAT CONSIST OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES AND ARE ABLE TO REPORT ON THE INTRACELLULAR ENVIRONMENT OF CELLS. THE USE OF FLUORESCENT REPORTER SIGNALS ALLOWS NON INVASIVE, NON DESTRUCTIVE AND ONLINE MONITORING OF THE CULTURE, WHICH REDUCES THE DELAY BETWEEN MEASUREMENT AND ANY NECESSARY INTERVENTION. THE PRESENT MINI REVIEW FOCUSES ON PROTEIN BASED BIOSENSORS THAT UTILIZE FRET AS THE SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION MECHANISM. THE MECHANISM OF FRET, WHICH UTILIZES THE RATIO OF EMISSION INTENSITY AT TWO WAVELENGTHS, HAS AN INHERENT ADVANTAGE OF BEING RATIOMETRIC, MEANING THAT SMALL DIFFERENCES IN THE EXPERIMENTAL SET UP OR BIOSENSOR EXPRESSION LEVEL CAN BE NORMALIZED AWAY. THIS ALLOWS FOR MORE RELIABLE QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATION OF THE CONCENTRATION OF THE TARGET MOLECULE. EXISTING FRET BIOSENSORS THAT ARE OF POTENTIAL INTEREST TO BIOPROCESS MONITORING INCLUDE THOSE DEVELOPED FOR PRIMARY METABOLITES, REDOX POTENTIAL, PH AND PRODUCT FORMATION. FOR TARGET MOLECULES WHERE A BIOSENSOR HAS NOT YET BEEN DEVELOPED, SOME CANDIDATE BINDING DOMAINS CAN BE IDENTIFIED FROM THE EXISTING BIOLOGICAL DATABASES. HOWEVER, THE REMAINING CHALLENGE IS TO MAKE THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A FRET BIOSENSOR FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENT.	***

CONSEQUENTLY, NEW CLINICAL END POINTS ARE NEEDED THAT IDENTIFY OR PREDICT PATIENTS THAT ARE AT RISK FOR EARLY RENAL FUNCTION DECLINE (ERFD). THE POTENTIAL CLINICAL UTILITY OF DIFFERENTIAL SCANNING CALORIMETRY (DSC) ANALYSIS OF BLOOD PLASMA AND OTHER BIOFLUIDS HAS RECENTLY BEEN REPORTED. THIS METHOD PROVIDES AN ALTERNATE PHYSICAL BASIS WITH WHICH TO STUDY DISEASE ASSOCIATED CHANGES IN THE BULK PLASMA PROTEOME. METHODS: DSC ANALYSIS OF BLOOD PLASMA WAS APPLIED TO IDENTIFY UNIQUE SIGNATURES OF ERFD IN SUBJECTS ENROLLED IN THE 1ST JOSLIN STUDY OF THE NATURAL HISTORY OF MICROALBUMINURIA IN TYPE 1 DIABETES, A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY OF T1D PATIENTS. RECENT DATA SUGGESTS THAT DIFFERENCES IN THE PLASMA PEPTIDOME OF THESE PATIENTS CORRELATE WITH LONGITUDINAL MEASURES OF RENAL FUNCTION. DIFFERENCES IN DSC PROFILE (THERMOGRAM) FEATURES WERE EVALUATED BETWEEN T1D MA INDIVIDUALS EXHIBITING ERFD (N 15) AND MATCHED CONTROL SUBJECTS (N 14). RESULTS: THE AVERAGE CONTROL GROUP THERMOGRAM RESEMBLED A PREVIOUSLY DEFINED HEALTHY THERMOGRAM. DIFFERENCES WERE EVIDENT BETWEEN ERFD AND CONTROL INDIVIDUALS. HEAT CAPACITY VALUES OF THE MAIN TWO TRANSITIONS WERE FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANT DISCRIMINATORS OF PATIENT STATUS. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS FROM THIS PILOT STUDY SUGGEST THE POTENTIAL UTILITY OF DSC PROTEOME ANALYSIS TO PROGNOSTIC INDICATORS OF RENAL DISEASE IN T1D. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: DSC SHOWS SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN THE BULK PLASMA PROTEOME THAT CORRELATE WITH CLINICAL STATUS IN T1D PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE UTILITY OF DSC PROFILING IN CLINICAL DIAGNOSTICS.

INCORPORATING AN ADDITIONAL THREE RECENT EXERCISE TRIALS, OUR REVIEW COLLECTIVELY INCLUDED 305 RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH 339 274 PARTICIPANTS. ACROSS ALL FOUR CONDITIONS WITH EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EXERCISE ON MORTALITY OUTCOMES (SECONDARY PREVENTION OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE, REHABILITATION OF STROKE, TREATMENT OF HEART FAILURE, PREVENTION OF DIABETES), 14 716 PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMISED TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS IN 57 TRIALS. NO STATISTICALLY DETECTABLE DIFFERENCES WERE EVIDENT BETWEEN EXERCISE AND DRUG INTERVENTIONS IN THE SECONDARY PREVENTION OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE AND PREDIABETES. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS WERE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN DRUG TREATMENT AMONG PATIENTS WITH STROKE (ODDS RATIOS, EXERCISE V ANTICOAGULANTS 0.09, 95% CREDIBLE INTERVALS 0.01 TO 0.70 AND EXERCISE V ANTIPLATELETS 0.10, 0.01 TO 0.62). DIURETICS WERE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN EXERCISE IN HEART FAILURE (EXERCISE V DIURETICS 4.11, 1.17 TO 24.76). INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN DIRECT AND INDIRECT COMPARISONS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSIONS ALTHOUGH LIMITED IN QUANTITY, EXISTING RANDOMISED TRIAL EVIDENCE ON EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS SUGGESTS THAT EXERCISE AND MANY DRUG INTERVENTIONS ARE OFTEN POTENTIALLY SIMILAR IN TERMS OF THEIR MORTALITY BENEFITS IN THE SECONDARY PREVENTION OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE, REHABILITATION AFTER STROKE, TREATMENT OF HEART FAILURE, AND PREVENTION OF DIABETES.	***

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE ASSOCIATIONS AMONG SEX, BMI, AND PROGNOSIS IN CLEAR CELL RCC PATIENTS. METHODS: WE RETROSPECTIVELY ANALYSED 435 PATIENTS WITH CLEAR CELL RCC WHO UNDERWENT A NEPHRECTOMY. THE ASSOCIATIONS AMONG SEX, BMI, CLINICOPATHOLOGIC FACTORS, AND CANCER SPECIFIC SURVIVAL (CSS) WERE ANALYSED. RESULTS: AS A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE, INCREASED BMI WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER CSS RATE BY UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS IN THE WHOLE POPULATION (HAZARD RATIO, 0.888 PER K GM( 2); 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, 0.803 0.982; P 0.021). A SUB POPULATION ANALYSIS BY SEX DEMONSTRATED THAT BMI WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH CSS IN MEN (P 0.004) BUT NOT IN WOMEN (P 0.725). MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS REVEALED BMI TO BE AN INDEPENDENT PREDICTOR OF CSS IN ONLY MEN. CONCLUSION: BODY MASS INDEX WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH CLEAR CELL RCC PROGNOSIS. HOWEVER, THE CLINICAL VALUE OF BMI MAY BE DIFFERENT BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN.	***

THIS REVIEW EVALUATES THE RISK OF EXTRAOCULAR TUMOUR SPREAD IN PATIENTS RECEIVING THERAPEUTIC INTRAVITREAL INJECTIONS FOR RETINOBLASTOMA. METHODS PUBMED (1946 PRESENT), SCOPUS (ALL YEARS), SCIENCE CITATION INDEX (1900 PRESENT) AND CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS CITATION INDEXSCIENCE (1990 PRESENT) ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED TO IDENTIFY ALL PUBLISHED REPORTS OF IVIT FOR RETINOBLASTOMA IN HUMANS. RESULTS 14 STUDIES WITH ORIGINAL IVIT DATA WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. A TOTAL OF 1304 INTRAVITREAL INJECTIONS WERE GIVEN IN 315 EYES OF 304 PATIENTS, WITH ONE REPORT OF EXTRAOCULAR TUMOUR SPREAD AND ONE PATIENT IN WHOM INTRAVITREAL TREATMENT COULD NOT BE EXCLUDED AS A CONTRIBUTOR TO METASTATIC DISEASE. THE PROPORTION OF SUBJECTS WITH EXTRAOCULAR TUMOUR SPREAD POTENTIALLY DUE TO IVIT IN THESE COMBINED REPORTS WAS 0.007 (95% CI 0.0008 TO 0.0236), WITH A MEAN FOLLOW UP OF 72.1MONTHS. IN A SUBSET OF 61 PATIENTS RECEIVING IVIT VIA SAFETY ENHANCING INJECTION TECHNIQUES (347 INJECTIONS, 19.6MONTHS MEAN FOLLOW UP), THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF TUMOUR SPREAD. CONCLUSIONS LOCAL AND SYSTEMIC TUMOUR SPREAD FOLLOWING IVIT IN CASES OF RETINOBLASTOMA IS RARE, AND THIS RISK IS POTENTIALLY REDUCED BY THE USE OF SAFETY ENHANCING INJECTION TECHNIQUES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE RISK OF TUMOUR SPREAD SHOULD NOT PRECLUDE IVIT USE FOR CAREFULLY SELECTED PATIENTS AS PART OF MULTI MODAL GLOBE SALVAGING THERAPY.	***

REASONABLE CLASSIFICATION OF SUCH GROUND MOTIONS HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE TO EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERS. THIS STUDY SERVES TO PROPOSE AN ENERGY BASED APPROACH THAT CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY THOSE GROUND MOTIONS WITH DOMINANT PULSES OBSERVED IN THE VELOCITY TIME SERIES; AND TIME INTEGRAL OF THE SQUARED GROUND VELOCITY IS EMPLOYED TO REPRESENT THE MOTION ENERGY. FOR REMOVING THE INFLUENCE OF HIGH FREQUENCY CONTENTS, THE POTENTIAL VELOCITY PULSE IS FIRST EXTRACTED WITH A PULSE MODEL. THE STARTING AND ENDING TIME POINTS AS WELL AS PERIOD OF THE VELOCITY PULSE ARE SUBSEQUENTLY DETERMINED BY THE PEAK POINT METHOD. RECORDS WITH PEAK GROUND VELOCITIES ABOVE 30 CM/S FROM A DATABASE CONTAINING MORE THAN 3600 RECORDED GROUND MOTIONS ARE SELECTED AND UTILIZED TO CALIBRATE THE FINAL CRITERION. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THOSE GROUND MOTIONS WHOSE DOMINANT VELOCITY PULSES HOLD RELATIVE ENERGY VALUES OF GREATER THAN 0.3 CAN BE SATISFACTORILY CLASSIFIED AS PULSE LIKE. THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS FURTHER USED TO IDENTIFY PULSE LIKE FEATURES IN ARBITRARY ORIENTATIONS AND PULSE LIKE GROUND MOTIONS POSSIBLY CAUSED BY FORWARD DIRECTIVITY EFFECTS.	***

THE NEW UK SCALE IS DEVELOPED FROM 1482 OBSERVATIONS OF 85 EARTHQUAKES ON 50 STATIONS LOCATED ACROSS THE BRITISH ISLES AND IRELAND. MOST OF THE OBSERVATIONS ARE FROM EPICENTRAL DISTANCES OF LESS THAN 600 KM AND ONLY FEW FROM GREATER DISTANCES UP TO 900 KM. THE DISTANCE RANGE OF THE SCALE IS, THEREFORE, 0 600 KM. THE AMPLITUDE OBSERVATIONS WERE USED TO INVERT FOR THE PARAMETERS DEFINING DISTANCE DEPENDENCE IN THE M L SCALE AND STATION CORRECTIONS. SYNTHETIC TESTS SHOWED THAT THE INVERSION WAS ROBUST. THE NEW M L SCALE FOR THE UK IS GIVEN BY M L LOG A + 0.95 LOG R + 0.00183R 1.76, IN WHICH A IS HORIZONTAL COMPONENT GROUND DISPLACEMENT AMPLITUDE IN NANOMETERS. THE AMPLITUDES ARE MEASURED ON TRACES THAT ARE FILTERED TO SIMULATE THE WOOD ANDERSON SEISMOGRAPH. R IS THE HYPOCENTRAL DISTANCE (IN KM). THE UK SCALE IS INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN SCALES DETERMINED FOR CALIFORNIA AND THOSE OF OTHER INTRAPLATE AREAS SUCH AS NORWAY OR THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. THE ABSOLUTE STATION CORRECTIONS FOUND ARE ALL LESS THAN 0.5. THE SCALE DERIVED FOR THE UK HELPS TO REDUCE THE OVERALL VARIANCE OF THE MEAN MAGNITUDE ESTIMATES BY 30%. MUCH OF THIS IMPROVEMENT IS DUE TO THE USE OF STATION CORRECTIONS. APPLYING THE UK SCALE TO THE DATABASE OF RECORDED EARTHQUAKES RESULTS IN A REDUCTION OF MAGNITUDE FOR EARTHQUAKES ABOVE M L 2 AND A SLIGHT INCREASE IN MAGNITUDE FOR EARTHQUAKES BELOW M L 2. THE BIGGEST CHANGE TO THE M L COMPUTATION IS LIKELY TO BE FOR SMALL EARTHQUAKES WITH FEW AMPLITUDE READINGS, WHERE THE USE OF STATION CORRECTIONS MAKES A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE.	***

THE PROBLEM IS CAST IN STATISTICAL TERMS USING REVERSE QUEUE THEORY, AND THE SOLUTION APPLIED TO A UNIQUELY DETAILED DATABASE OF SEISMOGENIC SOURCES: THE DISS ITALIAN DATABASE. AS A RESULT, THE SERIES OF THE RECURRENCE TIMES ESTIMATED FROM PALAEOSEISMOLOGY AND GEOLOGY IS FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SERIES OF THE TIME INTERVALS ELAPSED SINCE LAST EVENTS. SUCH AN INCOMPATIBILITY STANDS FOR A NUMBER OF ACTIVE SEISMOGENIC SOURCES ONE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE LARGER THAN THE NUMBER OF SOURCES WHICH PRODUCED HISTORIC AND INSTRUMENTAL EARTHQUAKES. IN PRACTICE, THIS IMPLIES THAT ONLY 1 OF THE 10 FUTURE M W > 5.5 EARTHQUAKES WILL BE A RECURRENCE OF AN EVENT REPORTED IN THE ITALIAN SEISMIC CATALOGS.

WE EXPLORED WHETHER PHYSICIAN CONTINUITY FURTHER INFLUENCES OUTCOMES AFTER DISCHARGE. METHODS: WE USED DATA FROM LINKED ADMINISTRATIVE DATABASES FOR ALL ADULTS AGED 20 YEARS OR MORE IN THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA WHO WERE DISCHARGED ALIVE FROM HOSPITAL BETWEEN JANUARY 1999 AND JUNE 2009 WITH A FIRST TIME DIAGNOSIS OF HEART FAILURE. WE USED COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARD MODELS WITH TIME DEPENDENT COVARIATES TO ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF FOLLOW UP WITH A FAMILIAR PHYSICIAN WITHIN THE FIRST MONTH AFTER DISCHARGE ON THE PRIMARY OUTCOME OF DEATH OR URGENT ALL CAUSE READMISSION OVER 6 MONTHS. A FAMILIAR PHYSICIAN WAS DEFINED AS ONE WHO HAD SEEN THE PATIENT AT LEAST TWICE IN THE YEAR BEFORE THE INDEX ADMISSION OR ONCE DURING THE INDEX ADMISSION. RESULTS: IN THE FIRST MONTH AFTER DISCHARGE, 5336 (21.9%) OF THE 24 373 IDENTIFIED PATIENTS HAD NO FOLLOW UP VISITS, 16 855 (69.2%) SAW A FAMILIAR PHYSICIAN, AND 2182 (9.0%) SAW UNFAMILIAR PHYSICIAN(S) EXCLUSIVELY. THE RISK OF DEATH OR UNPLANNED READMISSION DURING THE 6 MONTH OBSERVATION PERIOD WAS LOWER AMONG PATIENTS WHO SAW A FAMILIAR PHYSICIAN (43.6%; ADJUSTED HAZARD RATIO [HR] 0.87, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] 0.83 0.91) OR AN UNFAMILIAR PHYSICIAN (43.6%; ADJUSTED HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 0.97) FOR EARLY FOLLOW UP VISITS, AS COMPARED WITH PATIENTS WHO HAD NO FOLLOW UP VISITS (62.9%). TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL FOLLOW UP VISITS OVER THE 6 MONTH PERIOD, WE FOUND THAT THE RISK OF DEATH OR URGENT READMISSION WAS LOWER AMONG PATIENTS WHO HAD ALL OF THEIR VISITS WITH A FAMILIAR PHYSICIAN THAN AMONG THOSE FOLLOWED BY UNFAMILIAR PHYSICIANS (ADJUSTED HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 0.98). INTERPRETATION: EARLY PHYSICIAN FOLLOW UP AFTER DISCHARGE AND PHYSICIAN CONTINUITY WERE BOTH ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER OUTCOMES AMONG PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE. RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EXPLORE WHETHER PHYSICIAN CONTINUITY IS IMPORTANT FOR OTHER CONDITIONS AND IN SETTINGS OTHER THAN RECENT HOSPITAL DISCHARGE.	***

A POPULATION BASED ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE WHETHER BEVACIZUMAB APPROVAL WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED GLIOBLASTOMA SURVIVAL IN THE UNITED STATES. METHODSSURVEILLANCE, EPIDEMIOLOGY, AND END RESULTS (SEER) PROGRAM DATA WERE USED TO COMPARE SURVIVAL OF GLIOBLASTOMA PATIENTS WHO DIED IN 2006, 2008 (BOTH PRIOR TO APPROVAL OF BEVACIZUMAB), AND 2010 (AFTER APPROVAL OF BEVACIZUMAB). RESULTSTHE SEER DATABASE CONTAINED 1715 PATIENTS WITH GLIOBLASTOMA WHO DIED IN 2006, 1924 WHO DIED IN 2008, AND 1968 WHO DIED IN 2010 WHO MET STUDY INCLUSION CRITERIA. MEDIAN SURVIVAL WAS 8 MONTHS FOR THOSE WHO DIED IN 2006, 7 MONTHS IN 2008, AND 9 MONTHS IN 2010. THE DIFFERENCE IN SURVIVAL BETWEEN 2008 (PRE BEVACIZUMAB) AND 2010 (POST BEVACIZUMAB) WAS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT. THIS DIFFERENCE IS UNLIKELY TO BE DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN SUPPORTIVE CARE IN THIS SHORT INTERVAL, BECAUSE THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P.4440) BETWEEN PATIENTS WHO DIED IN 2006 VERSUS THOSE WHO DIED IN 2008. BETWEEN 2008 AND 2010, A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SURVIVAL WAS SEEN IN ALL AGE GROUPS EXCEPT THOSE PATIENTS AGED 18 TO 39 YEARS. CONCLUSIONSPATIENTS WHO DIED OF GLIOBLASTOMA IN 2010 HAD LIVED WITH DISEASE SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER THAN PATIENTS WHO DIED IN 2008. THE MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION FOR THIS CHANGE IS THE APPROVAL AND USE OF BEVACIZUMAB FOR PROGRESSIVE GLIOBLASTOMA, INDICATING THAT AT A POPULATION LEVEL, TREATMENT STRATEGIES INVOLVING BEVACIZUMAB PROLONG SURVIVAL.

METHODSUSING ADMINISTRATIVE DATABASES, 2535 PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT CYSTECTOMY BY 199 SURGEONS IN 90 HOSPITALS IN ONTARIO, CANADA, BETWEEN 1992 AND 2004 WERE IDENTIFIED. THE IMPACT OF PROVIDER VOLUME ON OVERALL SURVIVAL (OS) WAS ASSESSED USING COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODELS FULLY ADJUSTED FOR PATIENT AND TUMOR CHARACTERISTICS. SEPARATE MODELS WERE FIT TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SURGEON AND HOSPITAL VOLUME. TO CONFIRM THAT THE IMPACT OF VOLUME ON OS WAS INDEPENDENT OF THE EFFECT OF VOLUME ON SHORT TERM MORTALITY, ANALYSES WERE REPEATED EXCLUDING THOSE PATIENTS EXPERIENCING POSTOPERATIVE DEATHS. RESULTSOF 2535 PATIENTS, 1796 (70.9%) DIED DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. BOTH HIGHER HOSPITAL VOLUME (HAZARDS RATIO [PER UNIT INCREASE IN AVERAGE ANNUAL NUMBER OF PROCEDURES], 0.995; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, 0.990 1.000 [P.044]) AND HIGHER SURGEON VOLUME (HAZARDS RATIO, 0.984; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, 0.975 0.994 [P.002]) WERE FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED OS. EXCLUDING POST OPERATIVE DEATHS DID NOT ALTER THE RESULTS. FURTHER ANALYSES REVEALED THAT THE BENEFIT OF HIGH VOLUME WAS ATTAINED BY RECEIVING CARE FROM EITHER HIGH VOLUME HOSPITALS OR HIGH VOLUME SURGEONS. CONCLUSIONSHIGH VOLUME PROVIDERS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED LONG TERM MORTALITY RATES COMPARED WITH LOW VOLUME PROVIDERS.

THE RISK OF DEVELOPMENT OF CANCER IN SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS (SSC) HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY INVESTIGATED WITH INCONCLUSIVE RESULTS. TO SHED SOME LIGHT ON THE CONTROVERSY, WE CONDUCTED A META ANALYSIS OF ALL PUBLISHED ARTICLES LINKING SSC TO THE RISK OF CANCER DEVELOPMENT. METHODS: RELEVANT ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE STUDIES CHARACTERIZING THE ASSOCIATION OF CANCERS IN PATIENTS WITH SSC. STANDARDIZED INCIDENCE RATE (SIR) WITH ITS 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) OF EACH STUDY WAS COMBINED USING A FIXED/RANDOM EFFECT MODEL. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF SEVEN PAPERS INCLUDING 7183 SSC PATIENTS WERE IDENTIFIED, OF WHICH 7 REPORTED THE SIR FOR LUNG CANCER, 4 FOR NON HODGKINS LYMPHOMA (NHL) AND 4 FOR HEMATOPOIETIC CANCER AND 7 FOR BREAST CANCER. COMPARED WITH THE GENERAL POPULATION, THE COMBINED SIR WAS 3.14 (95% CI: 2.02 4.89), 2.68 (95% CI: 1.58 4.56), 2.57 (95% CI: 1.79 3.68) AND 1.09 (95% CI: 0.86 1.38), RESPECTIVELY.

METHODS: WE SEARCHED THREE ELECTRONIC DATABASES AND REVIEWED THE REFERENCE LISTS OF THE RETRIEVED ARTICLES UNTIL JULY 2012 TO IDENTIFY ELIGIBLE EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES. ELIGIBLE STUDIES WERE THOSE PUBLISHED IN BETWEEN 1965 AND JULY 2012 THAT PERMITTED QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HISTOLOGICALLY CONFIRMED BCC AND ANY OF THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS: HAIR COLOUR, EYE COLOUR, SKIN COLOUR, SKIN PHOTOTYPE, TANNING AND BURNING ABILITY, AND PRESENCE OF FRECKLING OR MELANOCYTIC NEVI.

FOR THIS EVALUATION, THE PRINCIPAL ACTORS IN THE FIELD (DOCTORS, NURSES, ETC.) AS WELL AS DECISION MAKERS MUST HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION THAT IS RELIABLE, SYNTHETIC AND EASY TO INTERPRET, AND WHICH REFLECTS THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS IN THE FIELD. WE PROPOSE HERE A METHODOLOGY TO MAKE THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN THE CONTEXT OF REDUCING INEQUALITIES WITH REGARD TO ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE FOR PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER IN THE REGION OF BURGUNDY. METHODS: WE USED THE NATIONAL MEDICO ADMINISTRATIVE DRG TYPE DATABASE, WHICH GATHERS TOGETHER ALL HOSPITAL STAYS. BY USING THIS DATABASE, IT WAS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY AND RECONSTRUCT THE CARE MANAGEMENT HISTORY OF THESE PATIENTS. THAT IS, BY LINKING TOGETHER ALL ATTENDED HOSPITALS, SORTED CHRONOLOGICALLY. ELIGIBLE PATIENTS WERE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD, WHATEVER THE GENDER AND HAD UNDERGONE SURGERY FOR THEIR LUNG CANCER. THEY HAD TO BE RESIDENTS OF BURGUNDY AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST OPERATION BETWEEN 2006 AND 2008. PATIENTS PATHWAY WAS DEFINED AS THE SEQUENCE OF ALL ATTENDED HOSPITALS (HOSPITAL STAYS) DURING THE YEAR OF FOLLOW UP LINKED TOGETHER USING AN ANONYMISED PATIENT IDENTIFIER. WE THEN CONSTRUCTED A PATHWAY TYPOLOGY OF PATHWAY USING AN UNSUPERVISED CLUSTERING METHOD, AND CONDUCTED A SPATIAL ANALYSIS OF THIS TYPOLOGY. RESULTS: BETWEEN 2006 AND 2008, WE SELECTED 495 PATIENTS IN THE 4 ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENTS OF THE BURGUNDY REGION. THEY ACCOUNTED FOR A TOTAL OF 3821 STAYS DURING THE YEAR OF FOLLOW UP. THERE WERE 393 MEN (79%) AND THE MEAN AGE WAS 64 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL: 63 65) YEARS. WE RECONSTRUCTED 94 PATHWAYS (ABOUT FIVE PER PATIENT). HERE, NEIGHBOURHOODS CARES ACCOUNTED FOR 41% OF THEM, WHILE 44% INCLUDED A SURGICAL INTERVENTION OUTSIDE THE REGION OF BURGUNDY. WE CONSTRUCTED A PATHWAY TYPOLOGY WITH FIVE CLASSES. SPATIAL ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF INITIAL SURGERIES TOOK PLACE IN THE MAJOR REGIONAL CENTRES. CONCLUSION: THE CONSTRUCTION OF A PATHWAY TYPOLOGY LEADS TO BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE REASONING THAT LIES BEHIND THE MOVEMENTS OF PATIENTS.

THE OCCURRENCE OF BRAIN METASTASES IS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR PROGNOSIS AND HIGH MORBIDITY, EVEN AFTER INTENSIVE MULTIMODAL THERAPY. THEREFORE, IDENTIFYING LUNG CANCER PATIENTS WITH WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK OF DEVELOPING BRAIN METASTASES AND APPLYING EFFECT INTERVENTION IS IMPORTANT TO REDUCE OR DELAY THE INCIDENCE OF BRAIN METASTASES. BIOCHEMICAL MARKERS MAY MEET AN UNMET NEED FOR FOLLOWING PATIENTS MECHANISMS OF BRAIN METASTASES. METHODS: DATA FOR THIS REVIEW WERE IDENTIFIED BY SEARCHES OF PUBMED AND COCHRANE DATABASES, AND REFERENCES FROM RELEVANT ARTICLES USING THE SEARCH TERMS LUNG CANCER AND BRAIN METASTASIS. MEETING ABSTRACTS, UNPUBLISHED REPORTS AND REVIEW ARTICLES WERE NOT CONSIDERED. RESULTS: CLINICAL RESULTS FOR PATHOLOGICAL AND CIRCULATING MARKERS INCLUDING CANCER MOLECULAR SUBTYPES, MIRNA, SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS, AND OTHER MARKERS ARE PRESENTED. HOWEVER, THESE BIOCHEMICAL MARKERS ARE NOT YET ESTABLISHED SURROGATE ASSESSMENTS FOR PREDICTION OF BRAIN METASTASES. CONCLUSIONS: BIOCHEMICAL MARKERS REPORTED ALLOWED PHYSICIANS TO IDENTIFY WHICH PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR BRAIN METASTASES. PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED CLINICAL STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO FURTHER ASSESS THE UTILITY OF THESE BIOCHEMICAL MARKERS. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

WE EXAMINED THE OVERALL SURVIVAL OF HIV INFECTED PATIENTS WHO DEVELOPED CANCER. DESIGN: A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. METHODS: USING THE TAIWAN LONGITUDINAL HEALTH INSURANCE DATABASE, WE COMPARED PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH HIV (N 9918) BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2002, AND DECEMBER 31, 2007 WITH AGE MATCHED CONTROLS (N 99,180). EACH PATIENT WAS FOLLOWED UNTIL THE END OF 2009 (LEAST 2 YEARS AFTER THE INITIAL HIV DIAGNOSIS) TO EVALUATE THE INCIDENCE OF MALIGNANCIES. RESULTS: THE RISK OF OVERALL MALIGNANCIES IN THE HIV INFECTED COHORT WAS 1.88 TIMES HIGHER THAN THE RISK OF A FIRST MALIGNANCY IN THE AGE MATCHED NON HIV INFECTED COHORT (INCIDENCE RATE RATIO [IRR]) 2.05, P < 0.0001). THE DIAGNOSIS OF A MALIGNANCY WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH SURVIVAL IN THE HIV INFECTED COHORT (P < 0.0011), AND HIV INFECTION HAD A SYNERGISTIC EFFECT ON THE SURVIVAL OF PATIENTS WITH MALIGNANCIES COMPARED WITH THE NON HIV INFECTED COHORT, ALL OF WHO HAD BEEN NEWLY DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER (P < 0.0001). HOWEVER, THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RISK OF DEVELOPING NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA (NPC), A HIGHLY PREVALENT MALIGNANCY IN TAIWAN, BETWEEN THE TWO COHORTS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT (IRR 0.22, 95% CI 0.03 1.65). CONCLUSIONS: THE RISK OF CANCER IN HIV INFECTED PATIENTS IN TAIWAN HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE ERA OF HIGHLY ACTIVE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY. A HISTORY OF HIV SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE SURVIVAL OF THE PATIENTS IN OUR STUDY COHORT AFTER THEY DEVELOPED CANCER. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 2B. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

AT THE ONSET OF INFECTION THE PROTIST CHANGES MORPHOLOGY WITHIN MINUTES: THE FLAGELLATED FREE SWIMMING CELL CONVERTS INTO THE AMOEBOID ADHERENT STAGE. THE MOLECULAR MACHINERY OF THIS PROCESS IS NOT WELL STUDIED, BUT IS THOUGHT TO INVOLVE ACTIN REORGANIZATION. WE HAVE CHARACTERIZED AMOEBOID TRANSITION, FOCUSING IN PARTICULAR ON TVFIM1, THE ONLY EXPRESSED PROTEIN OF THE FIMBRIN FAMILY IN TRICHOMONAS. ADDITION OF TVFIM1 TO ACTIN POLYMERIZATION ASSAYS INCREASES THE SPEED OF ACTIN FILAMENT ASSEMBLY AND RESULTS IN BUNDLING OF F ACTIN IN A PARALLEL AND ANTI PARALLEL MANNER. UPON CONTACT WITH VAGINAL EPITHELIAL CELLS, THE OTHERWISE DIFFUSE LOCALIZATION OF ACTIN AND TVFIM1 CHANGES DRAMATICALLY. IN THE AMOEBOID TVFIM1 ASSOCIATES WITH FIBROUS ACTIN BUNDLES AND CONCENTRATES AT PROTRUSIVE STRUCTURES OPPOSING THE TRAILING ENDS OF THE GLIDING AMOEBOID FORM AND RAPIDLY REDISTRIBUTES TOGETHER WITH ACTIN TO FORM DISTINCT CLUSTERS. LIVE CELL IMAGING DEMONSTRATES THAT TRICHOMONAS AMOEBOID STAGES DO NOT JUST ADHERE TO HOST TISSUE, RATHER THEY ACTIVELY MIGRATE ACROSS HUMAN EPITHELIAL CELLS. THEY DO SO IN A CONCERTED MANNER, WITH AN AVERAGE SPEED OF 20MMIN( 1) AND OFTEN USING THEIR FLAGELLA AND APICAL TIP AS THE LEADING EDGE.	***

OBJECTIVE THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ASSESS CURRENT USE, PREVIOUS USE, DURATION AND COURSE OF PREVENTIVE TREATMENT OF MIGRAINE IN DUTCH GENERAL PRACTICE. METHODS WE CONDUCTED A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY, FOR THE PERIOD BETWEEN 1997 AND 2007, IN THE INTERDISCIPLINARY PROCESSING OF CLINICAL INFORMATION (IPCI) DATABASE, A GP RESEARCH DATABASE IN THE NETHERLANDS (SOURCE POPULATION OF MORE THAN HALF A MILLION SUBJECTS). ALL PREVALENT AND INCIDENT MIGRAINE PATIENTS (N7367) WERE INCLUDED. RESULTS ABOUT 13% OF ALL MIGRAINE PATIENTS CURRENTLY USE PREVENTIVE THERAPY AND ALMOST HALF OF MIGRAINE PATIENTS HAVE PRIOR USE. OF THOSE STARTING WITH PREVENTIVE TREATMENT, 56% (95% CI: 54.3 64.7) STILL USED IT AFTER NINE MONTHS. THERE WAS A LONG DELAY BETWEEN MIGRAINE DIAGNOSIS AND PREVENTIVE TREATMENT START. FORTY FOUR PERCENT (95% CI 43.0 45.7) STARTED PREVENTIVE THERAPY IN THE STUDY PERIOD. CONCLUSION THIS LARGE PRIMARY CARE DATABASE STUDY SHOWS THAT A LIMITED NUMBER OF PATIENTS ARE CURRENT USERS OF PREVENTIVE TREATMENT, BUT MANY PATIENTS HAVE PRIOR USE. AFTER DIAGNOSIS THERE IS OFTEN AN EXTENDED TIME BEFORE PREVENTIVE TREATMENT IS APPLIED. ALSO THERE IS OFTEN ONLY ONE ATTEMPT. THE CONTINUATION IN TIME SEEMS APPROPRIATE.

AIMTO DETERMINE THE ACTUAL INCIDENCE OF SKIN CANCER IN DERMATOLOGY PRACTICE AND TO ESTIMATE HOW THIS RELATES TO THE FIRST PRIMARY TUMOURS (REGISTERED AT THE EINDHOVEN CANCER REGISTRY). METHODSWE EXAMINED 1001 RANDOMLY SELECTED PATIENT RECORDS AT CATHARINA HOSPITAL EINDHOVEN FOR MENTION OF SKIN CANCER. FOR EACH PATIENT, SKIN CANCERS WERE RECORDED IN A DATABASE, STARTING FROM 1 JANUARY 2004 UNTIL 1 MARCH 2010. THE TIME INTERVAL BETWEEN TUMOURS AND ANY HISTORY OF SKIN CANCER WERE ALSO RECORDED. RESULTSOF THIS GROUP, 876 PATIENTS WERE TREATED FOR SKIN CANCER DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. WE RECORDED A TOTAL OF 2106 TUMOURS WITH A MEAN OF 2.4 SKIN CANCERS PER PATIENT. NEARLY HALF (46%) OF PATIENTS DEVELOPED MULTIPLE TUMOURS, AND THE SECOND TUMOUR DEVELOPED WITHIN A MEDIAN PERIOD OF 5MONTHS. OVER A QUARTER (28%) OF PATIENTS WERE KNOWN TO HAVE HAD SKIN CANCER BEFORE 2004, THE START OF THE STUDY PERIOD. CONCLUSIONSTHE NUMBER OF NMSCS IN PRACTICE DIFFERS SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THE NUMBER OF FIRST PRIMARY HISTOLOGICALLY CONFIRMED NMSCS, AS USUALLY REPORTED BY THE EINDHOVEN CANCER REGISTRY. TO OBTAIN THE OPTIMUM BENEFIT FROM REGISTRATION OF NMSC, IT IS RECOMMENDED TO REGISTER ALL NMSCS, BECAUSE ONLY THIS COMPLETE NUMBER WILL GIVE AN INSIGHT INTO THE INCIDENCE OF THE RISING SKIN CANCER NUMBERS. BECAUSE SUBSEQUENT TUMOURS OCCUR FREQUENTLY, NMSC SHOULD BE REGARDED AS A CHRONIC DISEASE, AND INNOVATIONS IN DISEASE MANAGEMENT ARE REQUIRED FOR COST EFFECTIVE CONTROL.	***

THE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE VIROLOGICAL RESPONSE TO RAL CONTAINING REGIMENS AND THE PREVALENCE OF INTEGRASE MUTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH RAL FAILURE DESERVE FURTHER INVESTIGATION. FROM THE ANTIRETROVIRAL RESISTANCE COHORT ANALYSIS DATABASE, WE SELECTED TRIPLE CLASS EXPERIENCED SUBJECTS FAILING THEIR CURRENT TREATMENT WITH COMPLETE TREATMENT HISTORY AVAILABLE. SELECTION CRITERIA INCLUDED HIV RNA, CD4 COUNT AND HIV GENOTYPE WITHIN 3MONTHS OF RAL INITIATION. FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH 24 WEEK RESPONSE WERE ANALYSED; GENOTYPIC SENSITIVITY SCORES (GSS) AND WEIGHTED GSS WERE EVALUATED. VIROLOGICAL RESPONSE WAS ACHIEVED IN 74.3% OF 105 SUBJECTS. MUTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH RAL FAILURE WERE DETECTED IN 12/24 SUBJECTS WITH AN INTEGRASE GENOTYPE, WITH THE PREVALENCE OF Q148H+G140S. EACH EXTRA UNIT OF GSS (P 0.05, OR 2.62; 95% CI 1.00 6.87). WAS FOUND TO BE A ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONSE. WEIGHTED GSS HAD BORDERLINE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE (P 0.063, OR 2.04; 95% CI 0.96 4.33) WHEN STRATIFYING FOR DIFFERENT CUT OFFS (<1 AS REFERENCE, 1 1.49, 1.5), A BORDERLINE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE PROBABILITY OF RESPONSE APPEARED FOR GSS 1.5 (P 0.053, OR 4.00; 95% CI 0.98 16.25). GSS 1 SHOWED THE HIGHEST SENSITIVITY, 82.6%. RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVES DEPICTED THE WIDEST AREA UNDER THE CURVE (0.663, P 0.054) OF GSS 1. UNRESPONSIVENESS TO RAL CONTAINING REGIMENS AMONG TRIPLE CLASS EXPERIENCED SUBJECTS WAS LOW. THE ACTIVITY OF THE BACKGROUND REGIMEN WAS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONSE. ALTHOUGH FEW INTEGRASE GENOTYPES WERE AVAILABLE AT FAILURE, HALF OF THESE WERE WITHOUT INTEGRASE RESISTANCE MUTATIONS. THE SUBSTANTIAL RATE OF RAL FAILURE IN THE ABSENCE OF KNOWN RAL RESISTANCE MUTATIONS MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH ADHERENCE ISSUES AND THIS ISSUE WARRANTS FURTHER ANALYSIS IN LONGER OBSERVATIONS.	***

A TOTAL OF 1827 ADULT (64.9%) AND 32 PAEDIATRIC SUBJECTS (82.1%) HARBOURED THE VIRUS WITH AT LEAST ONE ETR MUTATION. V179I, Y181C AND G190A WERE THE MOST FREQUENT MUTATIONS IN BOTH GROUPS. A SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED RISK OF ETR RESISTANCE WITH ALL THREE ALGORITHMS (MONOGRAM (MGR) >3, TIBOTEC (TBT) >2 AND ENHANCED MGR (ENH) 4) EMERGED IN THE PAEDIATRIC POPULATION. MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS REVEALED AN INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING TBT >2 FOR NNRTI EXPOSURE, ENH 4 FOR NNRTI AND EFV EXPOSURE IN PAEDIATRIC SUBJECTS; NVP EXPOSURE AND HIGHER (3.5 LOG10) HIV RNA VALUES FOR ALL THREE ALGORITHMS IN ADULT SUBJECTS, WHEREAS CD4200/L APPEARED TO BE PROTECTIVE. THE RISK OF BEING ETR RESISTANT WAS MORE THAN DOUBLED FOR PAEDIATRIC VS. ADULT SUBJECTS, PROBABLY DUE TO A MORE EXTENSIVE USE OF NNRTI AND AN INCOMPLETE VIROLOGICAL CONTROL.	***

WE PERFORMED A ROUTINE META ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF SCS ON TREATMENT FAILURE RATE AND FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1S (FEV1) IMPROVEMENT COMPARED WITH PLACEBO IN AECOPD. SUBGROUP ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED BY DIVIDING THE STUDIES INTO A HIGH DOSE GROUP [INITIAL DOSE 80MG PREDNISONE EQUIVALENT (PE)/DAY] AND A LOW DOSE GROUP (INITIAL DOSE 30 80MG PE/DAY) IN ALL PATIENTS AND IN ONLY INPATIENTS. META REGRESSION WAS PERFORMED USING INITIAL DOSE AS AN INDEPENDENT FACTOR. WE CLASSIFIED THE SUSPECTED ADVERSE EFFECTS INTO SEVERAL GROUPS AND COMBINED THEM SEPARATELY. RESULTSOUR SEARCH YIELDED 12 STUDIES INVOLVING 1172 PATIENTS. SCS USE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE TREATMENT FAILURE RATE [RISK RATIO 0.58; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI): 0.46 0.73] AND IMPROVEMENT IN FEV1 (0.11L; 95% CI: 0.08 0.14L). THE HIGH DOSE REGIMEN DID NOT SHOW SUPERIORITY TO THE LOW DOSE REGIMEN. NO OBVIOUS CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE SCS EFFECT AND THE INITIAL DOSE. SCS LED TO AN OBVIOUS INCREASE IN HYPERGLYCEMIA RISK. HOWEVER, THE HIGH DOSE GROUP DID NOT SHOW OBVIOUSLY HIGHER RISK OF ADVERSE EFFECTS. CONCLUSIONSCS CAN REDUCE TREATMENT FAILURE RATE AND IMPROVE LUNG FUNCTION IN AECOPD. THE LOW DOSE REGIMEN (INITIAL DOSE 30 80MG/DAY PE) IS PROPER FOR TREATING AECOPD.	***

THEREFORE, THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE SPECTRAL REFERENCE DATA IS CONSTANTLY INCREASING. THIS RAPID INCREASE OFTEN EXHIBITS A POOR DATA MANAGEMENT, WHICH LEADS TO ULTIMATE ISOLATION OF DATA ON DISK STORAGES. SPECTRAL DATA WITHOUT PRECISE DESCRIPTION OF THE TARGET, METHODS, ENVIRONMENT, AND SAMPLING GEOMETRY CANNOT BE USED BY OTHER RESEARCHERS. MOREOVER, EXISTING SPECTRAL DATA (IN CASE IT ACCOMPANIED WITH GOOD DOCUMENTATION) BECOME VIRTUALLY INVISIBLE OR UNREACHABLE FOR RESEARCHERS. PROVIDING DOCUMENTATION AND A DATA SHARING FRAMEWORK FOR SPECTRAL DATA, IN WHICH RESEARCHERS ARE ABLE TO SEARCH FOR OR SHARE SPECTRAL DATA AND DOCUMENTATION, WOULD DEFINITELY IMPROVE THE DATA LIFETIME. RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (RDBMS) ARE MAIN CANDIDATES FOR SPECTRAL DATA MANAGEMENT AND THEIR EFFICIENCY IS PROVEN BY MANY STUDIES AND APPLICATIONS TO DATE. IN THIS STUDY, A NEW APPROACH TO SPECTRAL DATA ADMINISTRATION IS PRESENTED BASED ON SPATIAL IDENTITY OF SPECTRAL SAMPLES. THIS METHOD BENEFITS FROM SCALABILITY AND PERFORMANCE OF RDBMS FOR STORAGE OF SPECTRAL DATA, BUT USES GIS SERVERS TO PROVIDE USERS WITH INTERACTIVE MAPS AS AN INTERFACE TO THE SYSTEM. THE SPECTRAL FILES, PHOTOGRAPHS AND DESCRIPTIVE DATA ARE CONSIDERED AS BELONGINGS OF A GEOSPATIAL OBJECT. A SPECTRAL PROCESSING UNIT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EVALUATION OF METADATA QUALITY AND PERFORMING ROUTINE SPECTRAL PROCESSING TASKS FOR NEWLY ADDED DATA. AS A RESULT, BY USING INTERNET BROWSER SOFTWARE THE USERS WOULD BE ABLE TO VISUALLY EXAMINE AVAILABILITY OF DATA AND/OR SEARCH FOR DATA BASED ON DESCRIPTIVE ATTRIBUTES ASSOCIATED TO IT. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM IS SCALABLE AND BESIDES GIVING THE USERS GOOD SENSE OF WHAT DATA ARE AVAILABLE IN THE DATABASE, IT FACILITATES PARTICIPATION OF SPECTRAL REFERENCE DATA IN PRODUCING GEOINFORMATION.

RANGE SEARCH QUERY HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN USED TO RETURN ALL OBJECTS WITHIN A GIVEN RADIUS. HOWEVER, HAVING ALL OBJECTS IS NOT NECESSARY, ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE ALREADY ENOUGH OBJECTS CLOSER TO THE QUERY POINT. FURTHERMORE, EXPANDING THE RADIUS MAY GIVE USERS BETTER RESULTS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE A LOT OF OBJECTS JUST OUTSIDE THE SEARCH BOUNDARY. THEREFORE, IN THIS PAPER, WE FOCUS ON APPROXIMATE RANGE SEARCH, WHERE THE QUERY RESULTS ARE APPROXIMATE, RATHER THAN EXACT. WE PROPOSE APPROXIMATE STATIC RANGE SEARCH (ARS) WHICH COMBINES TWO APPROACHES, NAMELY (I) LOWERBOUND APPROXIMATE RANGE SEARCH, AND (II) UPPERBOUND APPROXIMATE RANGE SEARCH. USING ARS, WE ARE ABLE TO DELIVER A BETTER PERFORMANCE, TOGETHER WITH LOW FALSE HIT AND REASONABLE FALSE MISS. WE ALSO EXTEND ARS IN THE CONTEXT OF A CONTINUOUS QUERY SETTING, IN WHICH THE QUERY MOVES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN SPATIAL DATABASES AS A MOBILE USER WHO INVOKES THE QUERY IS MOVING. IN TERMS OF CONTINUOUS RANGE SEARCH, THE INTENTION IS TO FIND SPLIT POINTS THE LOCATIONS WHERE THE QUERY RESULTS WILL BE UPDATED. ACCORDINGLY, WE PROPOSE TWO METHODS FOR APPROXIMATE CONTINUOUS RANGE SEARCH, NAMELY (I) RANGE SEARCH MINIMIZATION, AND (II) SPLIT POINTS MINIMIZATION. OUR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION WHICH COMPARES OUR METHODS WITH THE TRADITIONAL CONTINUOUS RANGE SEARCH SHOWS THAT OUR METHODS CONSIDERABLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SPLIT POINTS, THEREBY IMPROVING OVERALL PERFORMANCE.	***

ONE OF THE COMMONLY APPLIED TECHNIQUES FOR THAT IS TO INVOKE TIME CONSTRAINED PERIODIC APPLICATION TRANSACTIONS TO CHECK THE STATUS OF THE OPERATION ENVIRONMENT. THE STATUS OF THE ENVIRONMENT IS REPRESENTED BY THE VALUES OF THE PHYSICAL ENTITIES IN THE OPERATION ENVIRONMENT WHICH ARE MAINTAINED AS REAL TIME DATA OBJECTS IN A REAL TIME DATABASE. UNFORTUNATELY, MEETING THE DEADLINES OF APPLICATION TRANSACTIONS AND MAINTAINING THE QUALITY OF REAL TIME DATA OBJECTS ARE CONFLICTING WITH EACH OTHER, BECAUSE THEY COMPETE FOR THE SAME COMPUTATION RESOURCES. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM OF UPDATE AND APPLICATION TRANSACTIONS CO SCHEDULING PROBLEM, IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A FIXED PRIORITY CO SCHEDULING ALGORITHM CALLED PERIODIC CO SCHEDULING (PCS). PCS USES PERIODIC UPDATE TRANSACTIONS TO MAINTAIN THE TEMPORAL VALIDITY OF REAL TIME DATA OBJECTS. IT JUDICIOUSLY DECIDES THE PRIORITY ORDERS AMONG ALL THE UPDATE AND APPLICATION TRANSACTIONS SO THAT THE CONSTRUCTED SCHEDULE CAN SATISFY THE DEADLINE CONSTRAINTS OF ALL THE APPLICATION TRANSACTIONS AND AT THE SAME TIME MAXIMIZE THE QUALITIES OF THE REAL TIME DATA OBJECTS TO ENSURE THE CORRECT EXECUTION OF APPLICATION TRANSACTIONS. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ALGORITHM IS VALIDATED THROUGH EXTENSIVE SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS.	***

HOWEVER, THESE DATA SETS ALWAYS COME WITH ERRORS IN THE MAPS AND ASSOCIATED METADATA. ERRORS ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED IN CONSERVATION STUDIES, DESPITE THEIR POTENTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE REPORTED EXTENT OF PROTECTION OF SPECIES AND ECOSYSTEMS. WE USED 3 CASE STUDIES TO ILLUSTRATE THE IMPLICATIONS OF 3 SOURCES OF ERRORS IN REPORTING PROGRESS TOWARD CONSERVATION OBJECTIVES: PROTECTED AREAS WITH UNKNOWN BOUNDARIES THAT ARE REPLACED BY BUFFERED CENTROIDS, PROPAGATION OF MULTIPLE ERRORS IN SPATIAL DATA, AND INCOMPLETE PROTECTED AREA DATA SETS. AS OF 2010, THE FREQUENCY OF PROTECTED AREAS WITH UNKNOWN BOUNDARIES IN THE WORLD DATABASE ON PROTECTED AREAS (WDPA) CAUSED THE ESTIMATED EXTENT OF PROTECTION OF 37.1% OF THE TERRESTRIAL NEOTROPICAL MAMMALS TO BE OVERESTIMATED BY AN AVERAGE 402.8% AND OF 62.6% OF SPECIES TO BE UNDERESTIMATED BY AN AVERAGE 10.9%. ESTIMATED LEVEL OF PROTECTION OF THE WORLDS CORAL REEFS WAS 25% HIGHER WHEN USING RECENT FINER RESOLUTION DATA ON CORAL REEFS AS OPPOSED TO GLOBALLY AVAILABLE COARSE RESOLUTION DATA. ACCOUNTING FOR ADDITIONAL DATA SETS NOT YET INCORPORATED INTO WDPA CONTRIBUTED UP TO 6.7% OF ADDITIONAL PROTECTION TO MARINE ECOSYSTEMS IN THE PHILIPPINES. WE SUGGEST WAYS FOR DATA PROVIDERS TO REDUCE THE ERRORS IN SPATIAL AND ANCILLARY DATA AND WAYS FOR DATA USERS TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THESE ERRORS ON BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENTS. EFECTOS DE ERRORES Y VACIOS EN CONJUNTOS DE DATOS ESPACIALES SOBRE LA EVALUACION DEL PROGRESO DE LA CONSERVACION RESUMEN LOS DATOS SOBRE LA LOCALIZACION Y EXTENSION DE AREAS PROTEGIDAS, ECOSISTEMAS Y DISTRIBUCION DE ESPECIES SON ESENCIALES PARA LA DETERMINACION DE BRECHAS EN LA CONSERVACION DE LA BIODIVERSIDAD Y LA IDENTIFICACION DE PRIORIDADES DE CONSERVACION FUTURAS. SIN EMBARGO, ESTOS CONJUNTOS DE DATOS SIEMPRE TIENEN ERRORES EN LOS MAPAS Y METADATOS ASOCIADOS. LOS ERRORES A MENUDO SON SOSLAYADOS EN LOS ESTUDIOS DE CONSERVACION, NO OBSTANTE SUS EFECTOS NEGATIVOS POTENCIALES SOBRE LA EXTENSION REPORTADA DE LA PROTECCION DE ESPECIES Y ECOSISTEMAS. UTILIZAMOS 3 ESTUDIOS DE CASO PARA ILUSTRAR LAS IMPLICACIONES DE 3 FUENTES DE ERROR EN LOS REPORTES DE PROGRESO HACIA LOS OBJETIVOS DE CONSERVACION: AREAS PROTEGIDAS CON LIMITES DESCONOCIDOS QUE SON REEMPLAZADOS POR CENTROIDES AMORTIGUADORES, PROPAGACION DE MULTIPLES ERRORES EN LOS DATOS ESPACIALES Y CONJUNTOS INCOMPLETOS DE DATOS DE AREAS PROTEGIDAS. HASTA 2010, LA FRECUENCIA DE AREAS PROTEGIDAS CON LIMITES DESCONOCIDOS EN LA BASE DE DATOS MUNDIAL DE AREAS PROTEGIDAS (BDMAP) PROVOCO QUE LA EXTENSION DE PROTECCION ESTIMADA DE 37.1% DE LOS MAMIFEROS NEOTROPICALES TERRESTRES FUERA SOBREESTIMADA EN 402.8% EN PROMEDIO Y 62.6% DE LAS ESPECIES FUE SUBESTIMADA EN 10.9% EN PROMEDIO. EL NIVEL ESTIMADO DE PROTECCION DE LOS ARRECIFES DE CORAL DEL MUNDO FUE 25% MAYOR CUANDO SE UTILIZARON DATOS RECIENTES DE RESOLUCION MAS FINA, CONTRARIAMENTE A LOS DATOS DE RESOLUCION GRUESA DISPONIBLES GLOBALMENTE. LA INCLUSION DE CONJUNTOS DE DATOS ADICIONALES AUN NO INCORPORADOS A BDMAP CONTRIBUYO HASTA EN 6.7% A LA PROTECCION ADICIONAL EN LOS ECOSISTEMAS MARINOS DE LAS FILIPINAS.

MANY TERRESTRIAL SNAILS ARE HABITAT SPECIALISTS, AND GENETIC STUDIES USING BOTH ALLOZYME AND DNA SEQUENCE DATA HAVE INDICATED THAT MANY SPECIES CONTAIN SUBSTANTIAL AND GEOGRAPHICALLY STRUCTURED GENETIC VARIATION. IN THIS STUDY, WE ASSESS THE GENETIC VARIATION WITHIN TWO SPECIES OF THE RARE TERRESTRIAL SNAIL GENUS PRESTONELLA, AN INHABITANT OF ROCKY AREAS ALONG WATER COURSES IN THE SOUTHERN GREAT ESCARPMENT OF SOUTH AFRICA, AND CORRELATE GENETIC DIVERSITY TO CLIMATIC VARIABLES. DNA SEQUENCE DATA FROM MITOCHONDRIAL 16S RDNA AND PARTIAL CYTOCHROME OXIDASE I GENES INDICATE THAT NEITHER SPECIES IS MONOPHYLETIC, AND THAT POPULATIONS ARE DEEPLY DIVERGENT, EVEN OVER DISTANCES OF A FEW HUNDRED METRES. PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANAYLSIS OF CLIMATIC VARIABLES DERIVED FROM TWO DATABASES INDICATES THAT GENETIC DIVERSITY OF THE POPULATIONS IS CORRELATED TO MOISTURE RELATED CLIMATIC VARIABLES. POPULATIONS WITH LITTLE OR NO DIVERSITY OCCUR IN MORE ARID REGIONS, AND ARE THUS MOST AT RISK FROM ANY FUTURE CLIMATIC CHANGES THAT WOULD INCREASE ARIDIFICATION. THESE MOISTURE VARIABLES ARE THUS POTENT DRIVERS OF GENETIC BOTTLENECKS AND MAY HAVE RESULTED IN HISTORICAL CLIMATE FILTERING OR LIMITATION OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE SPECIES. TEMPERATURE APPEARS TO BE A LESS IMPORTANT VARIABLE, A FINDING SUPPORTED BY PHYSIOLOGICAL DATA BASED ON HEART RATES THAT SHOW THAT DEATH OCCURS ONLY AT TEMPERATURES FAR HIGHER THAN FOUND IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT.	***

TWENTY EIGHT CONFIRMED CASES OF OSSN FROM 24,179 VETERANS WHO RECEIVED CARE AT THE MIAMI VETERANS AFFAIRS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND AFFILIATED SATELLITE EYE CLINICS BETWEEN MARCH 1, 2007, AND MARCH 1, 2012. DATA EXTRACTED FROM THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION DATABASE THAT COMPRISED DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS INFORMATION [BASED ON INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASE (ICD 9) CODES]. THE MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES WERE THE PERIOD PREVALENCE OF OSSN AND IDENTIFICATION OF FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRESENCE OF DISEASE.RESULTS:THE PERIOD PREVALENCE OF OSSN IN OUR POPULATION WAS 0.1%. THE RISK FACTORS STUDIED INCLUDED UV RELATED DERMATOLOGIC DISEASES (MELANOMA, SQUAMOUS AND BASAL CELL CANCER, AND ACTINIC KERATOSIS), UV RELATED OCULAR CONDITIONS (PTERYGIUM), HIV SEROPOSITIVITY, HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS RELATED DISEASES, AND TOBACCO USE. THE PRESENCE OF SKIN MALIGNANCY (SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA AND/OR BASAL CELL CARCINOMA) AND PTERYGIUM WAS FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRESENCE OF OSSN [ODDS RATIO, 4.40; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, 2.03 9.55; P < 0.0005 AND ODDS RATIO, 16.2; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, 7.11 36.9; P < 0.0005, RESPECTIVELY].CONCLUSIONS:THE PRESENCE OF NEOPLASIAS AND OCULAR CONDITIONS RELATED TO SUN EXPOSURE WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT RISK FACTOR FOR THE OCCURRENCE OF OSSN IN A SOUTH FLORIDA VETERANS AFFAIRS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM POPULATION CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS EPIDEMIOLOGICAL REPORTS WORLDWIDE.	***

HERE WE REPORT A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META ANALYSIS EXPLORING THIS ASSOCIATION. METHODS: WE SEARCHED LITERATURE DATABASES (MEDLINE, EMBASE, AND COCHRANE) FROM 1980 UNTIL DECEMBER 2011 TO IDENTIFY STUDIES EVALUATING THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MMR STATUS AND CLINICAL OUTCOME IN ENDOMETRIAL CANCER. THE MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES WERE OVERALL SURVIVAL (OS) AND DISEASE FREE SURVIVAL (DFS). RESULTS: TWENTY THREE STUDIES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THE MEDIAN SAMPLE SIZE OF STUDIES WAS 112, 74% WERE RETROSPECTIVE CASE SERIES AND 70% PERFORMED MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY (MSI) ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE THE STATUS OF MMR. ONLY 22% OF STUDIES USED THE PANEL OF FIVE MICROSATELLITE MARKERS RECOMMENDED BY THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE. SEVEN STUDIES USED IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY TO DEFINE MMR DEFICIENCY, BUT ONLY TWO OF THEM DETERMINED THE EXPRESSION OF ALL FOUR MMR PROTEINS. OVERALL, SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN MMR AND OUTCOME WERE OBSERVED IN 32% OF STUDIES. THERE WAS MARKED INTER STUDY HETEROGENEITY FOR ESTIMATES OF OS AND DFS. POOLED ANALYSIS DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN DEFICIENCY IN MMR AND WORSE OS (6 STUDIES, HAZARD RATIO [HR] 2.0,P0.11) OR DFS (4 STUDIES, BR RATIO 1.31, P0.66). CONCLUSION: THERE IS NO DEFINITIVE EVIDENCE OF A SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MMR STATUS AND DETRIMENTAL SURVIVAL IN ENDOMETRIAL CANCER. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

WE HAVE NOW APPLIED THE INITIAL MODEL TO A COHORT OF 474 TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS FROM ANOTHER CENTER FOR VALIDATION. WE PERFORMED TWO ANALYSES IN THE VALIDATION COHORT. THE FIRST WAS A STANDARD MODEL WITH VARIABLES DERIVED FROM THE ORIGINAL STUDY. THE SECOND WAS A SUMMARY SCORE MODEL, IN WHICH THE SUM OF DICHOTOMIZED VARIABLES (ALL THE VARIABLES DICHOTOMIZED AT CLINICALLY RELEVANT CUT POINTS) WAS USED TO CATEGORIZE, INDIVIDUALS INTO LOW (0 1), INTERMEDIATE (2, 3), OR HIGH (4 7) RISK GROUPS.

AN ADMINISTRATIVE DEFINITION WAS APPLIED (TWO PHYSICIAN CLAIMS OR ONE HOSPITALIZATION FOR DIABETES WITHIN A 2 YEAR PERIOD) AND COMPARED WITH SELF REPORTED DIABETES ALONE AND WITH SELF REPORTED DIABETES OR ELEVATED BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL (7 MMOL/L). POPULATION LEVEL PREVALENCE WAS ESTIMATED WITH THE USE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEFINITION CORRECTED FOR ITS SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY.RESULTSCOMPARED WITH SELF REPORTED DIABETES, SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY WERE 84.3% (95% CI 79.3 88.5%) AND 97.9% (97.4 98.4%), RESPECTIVELY. COMPARED WITH DIABETES BY SELF REPORT AND/OR GLUCOSE TESTING, SENSITIVITY WAS LOWER AT 58.2% (52.2 64.6%), WHEREAS SPECIFICITY WAS SIMILAR AT 98.7% (98.0 99.3%). ADJUSTED FOR SAMPLING WEIGHTS, POPULATION LEVEL PREVALENCE OF PHYSICIAN DIAGNOSED DIABETES WAS 7.2% (6.3 8.0%).

INCIDENCE RATES AND ADJUSTED HAZARD RATIOS (AHRS) FOR BLADDER CANCER WERE CALCULATED DURING ANNUAL TIME WINDOWS FOLLOWING THE INDEX DATE. ANALYSES WERE STRATIFIED BY NUMBER OF PHYSICIAN VISITS IN THE 2 YEARS BEFORE DIABETES DIAGNOSIS AND ADJUSTED FOR AGE, SEX, YEAR OF COHORT ENTRY, AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS.RESULTSTHE STUDY POPULATION WAS 54% MEN AND HAD AN AVERAGE AGE OF 60.7 13.5 YEARS; 1,171 NEW BLADDER CANCERS WERE DIAGNOSED OVER A MEDIAN FOLLOW UP OF 4 YEARS. IN THE FIRST YEAR AFTER DIABETES DIAGNOSIS, BLADDER CANCER INCIDENCE IN THE DIABETIC COHORT WAS 85.3 (95% CI 72.0 100.4) PER 100,000 PERSON YEARS AND 66.1 (54.5 79.4) IN THE CONTROL COHORT (AHR 1.30 [1.02 1.67], P 0.03). THIS FIRST YEAR INCREASED BLADDER CANCER RISK WAS LIMITED TO THOSE WITH THE FEWEST PHYSICIAN VISITS 2 YEARS BEFORE THE INDEX DATE (12 VISITS, AHR 2.14 [1.29 3.55], P 0.003). AFTER THE FIRST YEAR, TYPE 2 DIABETES WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH BLADDER CANCER.CONCLUSIONSTHE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT EARLY DETECTION BIAS MAY ACCOUNT FOR AN OVERESTIMATION IN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED INCREASED RISKS OF BLADDER CANCER ASSOCIATED WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES.	***

HOWEVER, WHETHER THIS RELATIONSHIP ACTUALLY TRANSLATES INTO AN INCREASED RISK OF MORTALITY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIABETES IS UNCERTAIN.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWE EVALUATED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN LONG TERM EXPOSURE TO AMBIENT FINE PARTICULATE MATTER (PM2.5) AND DIABETES RELATED MORTALITY IN A PROSPECTIVE COHORT ANALYSIS OF 2.1 MILLION ADULTS FROM THE 1991 CANADIAN CENSUS MORTALITY FOLLOW UP STUDY. MORTALITY INFORMATION, INCLUDING APPROXIMATE TO 5,200 DEATHS CODED AS DIABETES BEING THE UNDERLYING CAUSE, WAS ASCERTAINED BY LINKAGE TO THE CANADIAN MORTALITY DATABASE FROM 1991 TO 2001. SUBJECT LEVEL ESTIMATES OF LONG TERM EXPOSURE TO PM2.5 WERE DERIVED FROM SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS. THE HAZARD RATIOS (HRS) FOR DIABETES RELATED MORTALITY WERE RELATED TO PM2.5 AND ADJUSTED FOR INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AND CONTEXTUAL VARIABLES USING COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS SURVIVAL MODELS.RESULTSMEAN PM2.5 EXPOSURE LEVELS FOR THE ENTIRE POPULATION WERE LOW (8.7 MU G/M(3); SD, 3.9 MU G/M(3); INTERQUARTILE RANGE, 6.2 MU G/M(3)). IN FULLY ADJUSTED MODELS, A 10 MU G/M(3) ELEVATION IN PM2.5 EXPOSURE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN RISK FOR DIABETES RELATED MORTALITY (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.37 1.62). THE MONOTONIC CHANGE IN RISK TO THE POPULATION PERSISTED TO PM2.5 CONCENTRATION <5 MU G/M(3).CONCLUSIONSLONG TERM EXPOSURE TO PM2.5, EVEN AT LOW LEVELS, IS RELATED TO AN INCREASED RISK OF MORTALITY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIABETES.

ACCORDINGLY, AS THIS IS EMERGENT AREA OF RESEARCH THAT HAS SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL RELEVANCE, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS META ANALYSIS IS TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SDB WITH GDM.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWE SEARCHED SEVERAL ELECTRONIC DATABASES FOR ALL OF THE STUDIES PUBLISHED BEFORE JANUARY 2013 AND REVIEWED REFERENCES OF PUBLISHED ARTICLES. META ANALYTIC PROCEDURES WERE USED TO ESTIMATE THE UNADJUSTED AND BMI ADJUSTED ODDS RATIOS (ORS) USING A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL. SIGNIFICANT VALUES, WEIGHTED EFFECT SIZES, AND 95% CIS WERE CALCULATED, AND TESTS OF HOMOGENEITY OF VARIANCE WERE PERFORMED.RESULTSRESULTS FROM NINE INDEPENDENT STUDIES WITH A TOTAL OF 9,795 PREGNANT WOMEN SHOWED THAT SDB WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF GDM. WOMEN WITH SDB HAD A MORE THAN THREEFOLD INCREASED RISK OF GDM, WITH A POOLED BMI ADJUSTED OR 3.06 (95% CI 1.89 4.96).CONCLUSIONSTHESE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE A SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SDB AND GDM THAT IS EVIDENT EVEN AFTER CONSIDERED CONFOUNDING BY OBESITY. THIS META ANALYSIS INDICATES A NEED TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF EARLY RECOGNITION AND TREATMENT OF SDB EARLY DURING PREGNANCY.	***

OBJECTIVE: A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO SCREEN THE FOLLOWING FACTORS AS POTENTIAL PREDICTIVE FACTORS FOR LOCAL SKIN AND DIGESTIVE TOXICITIES, AND AS POTENTIAL PROGNOSTIC FACTORS FOR CUMULATIVE COLOSTOMY INCIDENCE: SEX, AGE, TUMOR SIZE, CLINICAL T AND N STAGE, CIRCUMFERENTIAL EXTENSION, INVASION OF ANAL MARGIN, HIV STATUS, TYPE OF CHEMOTHERAPY, AND TYPE OF RADIOTHERAPY AND DOSE DELIVERED. METHODS: ONE HUNDRED FIVE PATIENTS IN OUR DATABASE TREATED BETWEEN JANUARY 2000 AND FEBRUARY 2010 MET THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. RESULTS: MEDIAN FOLLOW UP WAS 54.1 MONTHS (RANGE, 1 133). EARLY AND LATE SEVERE LOCAL TOXICITIES OCCURRED IN 33 PATIENTS (31.4%) AND 18 PATIENTS (17.1%). THE 5 YEAR CUMULATIVE RATE OF COLOSTOMY WAS 26.6%. PREDICTIVE FACTORS FOR LOCAL SEVERE EARLY TOXICITIES WERE AS FOLLOWS: CLINICAL STAGE III/IV (P 0.01), NO BRACHYTHERAPY BOOST (P 0.003), AND USE OF CHEMOTHERAPY (P 0.01). ONLY BRACHYTHERAPY RETAINED ITS INDEPENDENCE IN MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS (OR 4.8 (1.4 16.3), P 0.01). HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS POSITIVITY (P 0.04) WAS THE ONLY PREDICTIVE FACTOR FOR LATE TOXICITIES IN UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS; IT WAS LINKED INDEPENDENTLY TO THE OCCURRENCE OF ULCER (OR 0.1 (0.01 0.66), P 0.01). TUMOR SIZE 4CM (P < 0.001) AND OCCURRENCE OF GRADE 2 TO 3 ULCERS (P < 0.001) WERE CORRELATED WITH GREATER CUMULATIVE COLOSTOMY INCIDENCE. CONCLUSIONS: IN THIS COHORT, NONUSE OF BRACHYTHERAPY WAS AN INDEPENDENT PREDICTIVE FACTOR FOR LOCAL ACUTE TOXICITY. HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS POSITIVITY WAS THE ONLY PREDICTIVE FACTOR FOR LOCAL LATE TOXICITIES AND STRONGLY INFLUENCED THE ONSET OF ULCER.	***

OBJECTIVE: WE ANALYZED THE PATTERNS OF USE AND SAFETY OF SODIUM HYALURONATE CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING COLECTOMY AND GYNECOLOGIC SURGERY. DESIGN: THIS IS A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. SETTING: THIS STUDY COVERED HOSPITALS NATIONWIDE. PATIENTS: ALL PATIENTS IN THE PREMIER PERSPECTIVE DATABASE WHO UNDERWENT COLECTOMY OR HYSTERECTOMY FROM 2000 TO 2010 WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSES. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: HYALURONATE CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE USE WAS DETERMINED BY BILLING CODES. FOR THE PRIMARY OUTCOME, WE USED HIERARCHICAL MIXED EFFECTS LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS TO DETERMINE THE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF HYALURONATE CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE, WHEREAS A PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHED ANALYSIS WAS USED TO SECONDARILY ASSESS THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HYALURONATE CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE USE AND TOXICITY (ABSCESS, BOWEL AND WOUND COMPLICATIONS, PERITONITIS). RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED 382,355 PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT HYSTERECTOMY AND 267,368 WHO UNDERWENT COLECTOMY. FOR HYSTERECTOMY, HYALURONATE CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE USE WAS 5.0% OVERALL, INCREASING FROM 1.1% IN 2000 TO 9.8% IN 2010. HYALURONATE CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE WAS USED IN 8.1% OF THOSE WHO UNDERWENT COLECTOMY AND INCREASED FROM 6.2% IN 2000 TO 12.4% IN 2010. THE YEAR OF DIAGNOSIS AND PROCEDURE VOLUME OF THE ATTENDING SURGEON WERE THE STRONGEST PREDICTORS OF HYALURONATE CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE USE. AFTER MATCHING AND RISK ADJUSTMENT, HYALURONATE CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE USE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ABSCESS FORMATION (1.5% VS 1.5%) (RELATIVE RISK 0.97; 95% CI, 0.84 1.12) IN THOSE WHO UNDERWENT HYSTERECTOMY. A PATIENT RECEIVING HYALURONATE CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE HAD A 13% INCREASED RISK OF ABSCESS (17.4% VS 15.0%) (RELATIVE RISK 1.13; 95% CI, 1.08 1.17) AFTER COLECTOMY. LIMITATIONS: THIS WAS AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY. CONCLUSION: HYALURONATE CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE USE HAS INCREASED OVER THE PAST DECADE FOR COLECTOMY AND HYSTERECTOMY. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HYALURONATE CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE USE AND ABSCESS FOLLOWING HYSTERECTOMY, HYALURONATE CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE USE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A SMALL INCREASED RISK OF ABSCESS AFTER COLECTOMY.	***

HERE WE ANALYZED, FOR THE FIRST TIME, A LONG TERM (1992 2009) MULTI SITE CAPTURE RECAPTURE DATABASE COLLECTED AT FOUR LOCAL POPULATIONS OF A LONG LIVED SEABIRD, THE AUDOUINS GULL LARUS AUDOUINII, COVERING 90% OF ITS TOTAL WORLD POPULATION. THOSE LOCAL POPULATIONS SHOW DIFFERENT ECOLOGICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC FEATURES THAT ALLOW US TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF SEVERAL KEY FACTORS INVOLVED IN BREEDING DISPERSAL PATTERNS AT LARGE SPATIO TEMPORAL SCALES. A RECENTLY DEVELOPED ANALYTICAL TOOL IN MARK RECAPTURE MODELLING, THE MULTI EVENT APPROACH, ALLOWED US TO OBTAIN SEPARATE DEPARTURE AND SETTLEMENT PROBABILITIES AND TEST DIFFERENT BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESES FOR EACH STEP OF THE DISPERSAL PROCESS. OUR RESULTS REVEALED THAT SITE FIDELITY WAS THE MOST COMMON STRATEGY AMONG BREEDERS, AND DISPERSAL WAS ONLY HIGH FROM THE SITE WITH THE LOWEST POPULATION SIZE AND HABITAT QUALITY. HOWEVER, DEPARTURES FROM THE TWO LARGEST LOCAL POPULATIONS INCREASED OVER THE STUDY PERIOD IN RESPONSE TO SEVERE ECOLOGICAL PERTURBATIONS. DISPERSERS CHOSE DIFFERENT SETTLEMENT PATCHES DEPENDING ON THEIR SITE OF ORIGIN, WITH SETTLEMENT CHOICES DETERMINED BY THE POPULATION SIZE OF THE DESTINATION COLONY RATHER THAN BY THE LOCAL REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE, FORAGING AREA (A PROXY OF FOOD AVAILABILITY) OR DISTANCE TO THE DESTINATION SITE. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT A BREEDING SITE IS NOT ABANDONED BY BREEDERS UNLESS A SERIES OF CUMULATIVE PERTURBATIONS OCCUR; ONCE DISPERSING, SETTLEMENT IS DIRECTED TOWARDS DENSELY POPULATED SITES, WITH DISPERSERS USING POPULATION SIZE TO RAPIDLY ASSESS THE QUALITY OF THE BREEDING PATCH.	***

EXTENSIVE SEARCHES OF SCHOLARLY LITERATURE WERE CONDUCTED USING THE MAIN MEDICAL AND NURSING ELECTRONIC DATABASES, INCLUDING CUMULATIVE INDEX TO NURSING AND ALLIED HEALTH LITERATURE, MEDLINE AND PUBMED, DURING 2011 AND AGAIN IN JULY 2012. SEVENTEEN PEER REVIEWED ENGLISH LANGUAGE ORIGINAL QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE STUDIES FROM 2001 TO 2012 WERE SELECTED AND CRITICALLY APPRAISED USING AN EVALUATION TOOL BASED ON PUBLISHED INSTRUMENTS. RELEVANT THEMES IDENTIFIED WERE: PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS, RESPECT AND BARRIERS TO COMMUNICATION; MULTIPLE OR REPEATED HANDOVERS; IDENTIFICATION OF STAFF IN THE ED; SIGNIFICANCE OF VITAL SIGNS; NEED FOR A STRUCTURED HANDOVER TOOL; DOCUMENTATION AND OTHER COMMUNICATION METHODS AND EDUCATION AND TRAINING TO IMPROVE HANDOVERS. THE ISSUES RAISED IN THE LITERATURE INCLUDED THE NEED TO: PRODUCE MORE COMPLETE AND CONCISE HANDOVERS, CREATE RESPECTFUL AND EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION, AND IDENTIFY STAFF IN THE ED. A STRUCTURED HANDOVER TOOL SUCH AS ISBAR (A MNEMONIC COVERING INTRODUCTION, SITUATION, BACKGROUND, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS) WOULD APPEAR TO PROVIDE A SOLUTION TO MANY OF THESE ISSUES. THE RECORDING OF VITAL SIGNS AND TRANSFER OF THESE DATA MIGHT BE IMPROVED WITH BETTER OBSERVATION SYSTEMS INCORPORATING EARLY WARNING STRATEGIES.

THE PROPOSED APPROACH USES THE FLOW INFORMATION OF ALL 3 DIMENSIONS TO CLASSIFY AN ACTION. IN OUR APPROACH, WE HAVE OBTAINED THE 2 D OPTICAL FLOW AND USED IT ALONG WITH THE DEPTH IMAGE TO OBTAIN THE DEPTH FLOW (Z MOTION VECTORS). THE OBTAINED FLOW CAPTURES THE DYNAMICS OF THE ACTIONS IN SPACE TIME. FEATURE VECTORS ARE OBTAINED BY AVERAGING THE 3 D MOTION OVER A GRID LAID OVER THE SILHOUETTE IN A HIERARCHICAL FASHION. THESE HIERARCHICAL FINE TO COARSE WINDOWS CAPTURE THE MOTION DYNAMICS OF THE OBJECT AT VARIOUS SCALES. THE EXTRACTED FEATURES ARE USED TO TRAIN A META COGNITIVE RADIAL BASIS FUNCTION NETWORK (MCRBFN) THAT USES A PROJECTION BASED LEARNING (PBL) ALGORITHM, REFERRED TO AS PBL MCRBFN, HENCEFORTH. PBL MCRBFN BEGINS WITH ZERO HIDDEN NEURONS AND BUILDS THE NETWORK BASED ON THE BEST HUMAN LEARNING STRATEGY, NAMELY, SELF REGULATED LEARNING IN A META COGNITIVE ENVIRONMENT. WHEN A SAMPLE IS USED FOR LEARNING, PBLMCRBFN USES THE SAMPLE OVERLAPPING CONDITIONS, AND A PROJECTION BASED LEARNING ALGORITHM TO ESTIMATE THE PARAMETERS OF THE NETWORK. THE PERFORMANCE OF PBL MCRBFN IS COMPARED TO THAT OF A SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) AND EXTREME LEARNING MACHINE (ELM) CLASSIFIERS WITH REPRESENTATION OF EVERY PERSON AND ACTION IN THE TRAINING AND TESTING DATASETS. PERFORMANCE STUDY SHOWS THAT PBL MCRBFN OUTPERFORMS THESE CLASSIFIERS IN RECOGNIZING ACTIONS IN 3 D. FURTHER, A SUBJECT INDEPENDENT STUDY IS CONDUCTED BY LEAVE ONE SUBJECT OUT STRATEGY AND ITS GENERALIZATION PERFORMANCE IS TESTED. IT IS OBSERVED FROM THE SUBJECT INDEPENDENT STUDY THAT MCRBFN IS CAPABLE OF GENERALIZING ACTIONS ACCURATELY. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS BENCHMARKED WITH VIDEO ANALYTICS LAB (VAL) DATASET AND BERKELEY MULTIMODAL HUMAN ACTION DATABASE (MHAD). (C) 2013 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

FIRSTLY, WE PRESENT CONTINUOUS PROBABILISTIC LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS (PLSA) AND DERIVE ITS CORRESPONDING EXPECTATION MAXIMIZATION (EM) ALGORITHM. CONTINUOUS PLSA ASSUMES THAT ELEMENTS ARE SAMPLED FROM A MULTIVARIATE GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION GIVEN A LATENT ASPECT, INSTEAD OF A MULTINOMIAL ONE IN TRADITIONAL PLSA. FURTHERMORE, WE PROPOSE A HYBRID FRAMEWORK WHICH EMPLOYS CONTINUOUS PLSA TO MODEL VISUAL FEATURES OF IMAGES IN GENERATIVE LEARNING STAGE AND USES ENSEMBLES OF CLASSIFIER CHAINS TO CLASSIFY THE MULTI LABEL DATA IN DISCRIMINATIVE LEARNING STAGE. THEREFORE, THE FRAMEWORK CAN LEARN THE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN FEATURES AS WELL AS THE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN WORDS. SINCE THE HYBRID APPROACH COMBINES THE ADVANTAGES OF GENERATIVE AND DISCRIMINATIVE LEARNING, IT CAN PREDICT SEMANTIC ANNOTATION PRECISELY FOR UNSEEN IMAGES. FINALLY, WE CONDUCT THE EXPERIMENTS ON THREE BASELINE DATASETS AND THE RESULTS SHOW THAT OUR APPROACH OUTPERFORMS MANY STATE OF THE ART APPROACHES. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

ACCURACY HAS BEEN REGARDED AS A PRIMARY MEASUREMENT FOR THE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF THE MODELS, BUT STABILITY WHICH INDICATES THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE PERFORMANCE TO MODEL PARAMETER VARIATION ALSO BECOMES ESSENTIAL. A STABLE MODEL IS IN PRACTICE OF BENEFIT TO THE MEDICAL SPECIALISTS WHO MAY HAVE LITTLE EXPERTISE IN MODEL TUNING. THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS WORK IS TO ADDRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STABILITY OF A MODEL AND TO SUGGEST ONE OF SUCH MODELS. METHODS: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THREE PROMINENT MACHINE LEARNING MODELS WAS CARRIED OUT FOR THE PROGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVABILITY: SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES, ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS, AND SEMISUPERVISED LEARNING MODELS. MATERIAL: THE SURVEILLANCE, EPIDEMIOLOGY, AND END RESULTS DATABASE FOR BREAST CANCER WAS USED, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON CANCER INCIDENCE IN THE UNITED STATES. RESULTS: THE BEST PERFORMANCE WAS OBTAINED FROM THE SEMI SUPERVISED LEARNING MODEL. IT SHOWED GOOD OVERALL ACCURACY AND STABILITY UNDER MODEL PARAMETER VARIATION. THE SHARPENING PROCEDURE ENHANCED THE STABILITY OF THE MODEL VIA THE NOISE REDUCTION. CONCLUSION: WE SUGGEST THAT SEMI SUPERVISED LEARNING MODEL IS A GOOD CANDIDATE THAT MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS READILY EMPLOY WITHOUT CONSUMING THE TIME AND EFFORT FOR PARAMETER SEARCHING FOR A SPECIFIC MODEL. THE EASE OF USE AND FASTER TIME TO RESULTS OF THE PREDICTIVE MODEL WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD TO THE ACCURATE AND LESS INVASIVE PROGNOSIS FOR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER LTD.

THEY ALLOWED DETERMINING THE SINKHOLE FORMATION MECHANISM AND LOCALIZING THE SINKHOLE HAZARDOUS ZONES. THE SRFR METHOD PERMITTED TO DELINEATE THE UNDERGROUND EDGE OF A SALT LAYER AT THE DEPTH OF 50 M. THE SALT EDGE WAS SHAPED LIKE THE SINKHOLE LINE ON THE SURFACE. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE SINKHOLE DEVELOPMENT IS LINKED TO THE SALT EDGE. GEOELECTRICAL QUASI 3D MAPPING BASED ON THE ERT TECHNIQUE DETECTED LARGE RESISTIVITY ANOMALIES WITH 250 300 M(2) DIAMETER AND 25 35 M DEEP. THE EIN GEDI AREA HAS BEEN ALSO MAPPED BY THE USE OF MICROGRAVITY METHOD. THE RESIDUAL BOUGUER GRAVITY ANOMALY MAP SHOWS NEGATIVE ANOMALIES ARRANGED ALONG THE EDGE OF THE SALT LAYER. THOSE GRAVITY ANOMALIES OVERALL ARE VERY SIMILAR IN PLAN TO THE RESISTIVITY DISTRIBUTION IN THIS AREA. THE RESULTS OF FORWARD MODELING INDICATE THAT BOTH HIGH RESISTIVITY AND RESIDUAL GRAVITY ANOMALIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A SUBSURFACE DECOMPACTION OF THE SOIL MASS AND DEEP CAVITY AT THE SINKHOLE SITE. FOLLOWING MONITORING OF THE SINKHOLE DEVELOPMENT CARRIED OUT BY THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF ISRAEL CONFIRMED OUR SUGGESTIONS. THE DRILLING OF NUMEROUS BOREHOLES VERIFIED THE LOCATION OF THE SALT EDGE. GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS) DATABASE TESTIFIES THAT DURING 2003 2009 NEW SINKHOLES ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP ALONG THE SALT EDGE WITHIN A NARROW 50 100 M WIDE STRIP ORIENTED APPROXIMATELY IN NORTH SOUTH DIRECTION (SLIGHTLY PARALLEL TO THE SHORELINE). NO PROMOTION IN WEST EAST DIRECTION (PERPENDICULARLY TO THE DS SHORELINE) WAS OBSERVED IN ISRAEL. COLLAPSE OF SINKHOLES AND THEIR CLUSTERING HAVE BEEN OCCURRED WITHIN THE AREA OF HIGH RESISTIVITY ANOMALY AND NEGATIVE RESIDUAL GRAVITY ANOMALY. SIMILAR STUDIES CARRIED OUT AT THE GHOR AL HADITHA AREA (JORDAN) HAVE SHOWN THAT SINKHOLES THERE ARE ALSO ARRANGED ALONG THE WINDING LINE CONFORMING TO THE SALT EDGE. IN THIS AREA SINKHOLES ARE SLOWLY MOVED TO THE DEAD SEA DIRECTION. RESULTS OF GEOPHYSICAL STUDIES IN NUMEROUS DS SITES INDICATE SIMILAR SINKHOLE DEVELOPMENT. IT ALLOWED GENERATING OF THE SINKHOLE FORMATION MODEL BASED ON ANCIENT (10,000 11,000 YEAR OLD) SALT BELT GIRDING THE DEAD SEA ALONG ITS SHORES.	***	
	GRRRU	GANDY,MILENA	SHARPE,LOUISE	PERRY,KATHRYN NICHOLSON						UNIVERSIT SYDNEY,AUSTRALIA	UNIVERSIT SYDNEY,AUSTRALIA	UNIVERSIT WESTERN SYDNEY,AUSTRALIA						COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY FOR DEPRESSION IN PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW	2013	EPILEPSIA	54	10	1	MOOD	PSYCHOTHERAPY	SEIZURE				1	SIN CORRESPONDIG	COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) IS A RECOMMENDED TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION IN PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY (PWE); HOWEVER, A RECENT COCHRANE REVIEW FOUND THAT THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THAT ANY PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY IS EFFECTIVE. THIS CONCLUSION PROVIDES LITTLE HELP TO CLINICIANS WHO PROVIDE INTERVENTIONS FOR DEPRESSED PWE. THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY AND QUALITATIVELY REVIEW THE LITERATURE ON THE EFFICACY OF CBT FOR DEPRESSION IN PWE BASED ON RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND CASE SERIES. WE AIM TO DETERMINE PATTERNS IN THE LITERATURE TO INFORM THE TYPE OF CBT, IF ANY, THAT SHOULD BE OFFERED TO PWE WHO ARE DEPRESSED. DATABASES MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, AND THE COCHRANE EBM REVIEWS WERE SEARCHED VIA OVID. SELECTION CRITERIA INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: (1) PARTICIPANTS WITH EPILEPSY; (2) USE OF CBT; (3) VALID DEPRESSION OUTCOME MEASURE; AND (4) PUBLISHED IN PEER REVIEWED JOURNAL IN ENGLISH. INCLUSIONS OF STUDIES WERE ASSESSED BY TWO INDEPENDENT RESEARCHERS. WE IDENTIFIED 14 OUTCOME PAPERS FOR 13 CBT TRIALS INCLUDING 6 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND 7 CASE SERIES. POSITIVE EFFECTS OF CBT ON DEPRESSION WERE REPORTED IN THREE OF SIX RCTS. A REVIEW OF THEIR CONTENT REVEALED THAT ALL EFFECTIVE RCTS SPECIFICALLY TAILORED CBT TO IMPROVE DEPRESSION. CONVERSELY, TWO OF THREE RCTS THAT FAILED TO FIND DEPRESSION RELATED EFFECTS FOCUSED ON IMPROVING SEIZURE CONTROL. THIS PATTERN WAS ALSO OBSERVED IN THE CASE SERIES. ALTHOUGH LIMITED IN NUMBER AND HAVING METHODOLOGIC LIMITATIONS, THE TREATMENT STUDIES INCLUDED IN OUR REVIEW SUGGEST THAT INTERVENTIONS TAILORED TOWARD IMPROVING DEPRESSION ARE POSSIBLY EFFICACIOUS, WHEREAS THOSE THAT FOCUS ON IMPROVING SEIZURE CONTROL DO NOT APPEAR TO BE. HOWEVER, THIS REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS THAT THERE IS NEED FOR FURTHER RCTS IN THIS AREA IN ORDER TO CONFIRM THE POSSIBLE EFFICACY OF CBT FOR DEPRESSION IN PWE.	***

WE APPLIED THESE CRITERIA TO PATIENTS EVALUATED FOR RE AND EPILEPSY SURGERY CONTROLS TO DETERMINE THE SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY, AND POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE PREDICTIVE VALUES (PPVS, NPVS) USING PATHOLOGY AS THE GOLD STANDARD. METHODSWE IDENTIFIED PATIENTS EVALUATED FOR RE BASED ON MEDICAL RECORDS FROM 1993 TO 2011. FIFTY TWO CONTROL PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY EPILEPSY, UNILATERAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) CHANGES, AND BIOPSIES WERE SELECTED FROM AN EPILEPSY SURGERY DATABASE FROM MATCHING YEARS. PATIENTS MEETING ALL THREE OF GROUP A AND/OR TWO OF THREE GROUP B CRITERIA WERE CLASSIFIED AS MEETING FULL CRITERIA (POSITIVE). PATIENTS NOT MEETING FULL CRITERIA WERE CLASSIFIED AS NEGATIVE. WHEN AVAILABLE, PATHOLOGY FINDINGS WERE RE REVIEWED WITH NEUROPATHOLOGISTS, AND MRI IMAGING WAS RE REVIEWED WITH A NEURORADIOLOGIST. KEY FINDINGSRE WAS CONSIDERED IN THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS FOR 82 PATIENTS, OF WHOM 35 HAD BIOPSIES. TWENTY PATIENTS MET FULL CRITERIA (POSITIVE) WITHOUT ANOTHER EXPLANATION, INCLUDING SEVEN FOR WHOM BIOPSY WAS REQUIRED TO MEET CRITERIA AND ONE IN WHOM ANOTHER ETIOLOGY WAS IDENTIFIED. TWO PATIENTS MET FULL CRITERIA BUT HAD ANOTHER EXPLANATION. THIRTY FIVE MET PARTIAL CRITERIA (NEGATIVE), OF WHOM 14 HAD ANOTHER ETIOLOGY IDENTIFIED. TWENTY FIVE MET NO CRITERIA (NEGATIVE). THE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA HAD A SENSITIVITY OF 81% WITH FOUR FALSE NEGATIVES (CRITERIA NEGATIVE, BIOPSY POSITIVE) WHEN COMPARED TO PATHOLOGY AS A GOLD STANDARD. FIVE FALSE POSITIVES (CRITERIA POSITIVE, BIOPSY NEGATIVE) HAD IDENTIFIABLE ALTERNATE DIAGNOSES. SIGNIFICANCETHE 2005 BIEN CLINICAL DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR RE HAVE REASONABLY HIGH SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY AND GOOD CLINICAL PATHOLOGIC CORRELATION IN MOST CASES. WE SUGGEST MODIFICATION OF THE CRITERIA TO ALLOW INCLUSION OF CASES WITH WELL DESCRIBED BUT LESS COMMON FEATURES. SPECIFICALLY WE SUGGEST MAKING THE DIAGNOSIS IN THE ABSENCE OF EPILEPSIA PARTIALIS CONTINUA (EPC) OR CLEAR PROGRESSION OF FOCAL CORTICAL DEFICITS OR MRI FINDINGS IF BIOPSY IS POSITIVE AND TWO OF THE A CRITERIA ARE MET (B3 PLUS TWO OF THREE A CRITERIA). THIS WOULD IMPROVE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE CRITERIA.	***

WE STUDIED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN AED RESISTANT EPILEPSY AND CNLS, INCLUDING THE FEASIBILITY AND OUTCOME OF RESECTIVE SURGERY. METHODSFROM THE PROSPECTIVE DATABASE MAINTAINED AT OUR EPILEPSY CENTER, WE REVIEWED THE DATA OF ALL PATIENTS WITH AED RESISTANT EPILEPSY WHO UNDERWENT PRESURGICAL EVALUATION FROM JANUARY 2001 TO JULY 2010 AND HAD CNL ON IMAGING. WE USED CLINICAL, NEUROIMAGING, AND INTERICTAL, ICTAL, AND INTRACRANIAL ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY (EEG) FINDINGS TO DETERMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CNL AND EPILEPSY. SUITABLE CANDIDATES UNDERWENT RESECTIVE SURGERY. KEY FINDINGSFORTY FIVE PATIENTS FULFILLED THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. IN 17 PATIENTS, CNL WAS PROVEN TO BE THE CAUSATIVE LESION FOR AED RESISTANT EPILEPSY (GROUP 1); IN 18 PATIENTS, CNL WAS ASSOCIATED WITH UNILATERAL HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS (HS; GROUP 2); AND IN 10 PATIENTS, CNLS WERE CONSIDERED AS INCIDENTAL LESIONS (GROUP 3). IN GROUP 1 PATIENTS, CNLS WERE MORE COMMON IN FRONTAL LOBES (12/17), WHEREAS IN GROUP 2 PATIENTS, CNLS WERE MORE COMMONLY LOCATED IN TEMPORAL LOBES (11/18; P0.002). GROUP 2 PATIENTS WERE OF A YOUNGER AGE AT EPILEPSY ONSET THAN THOSE IN GROUP 1 (8.97.3 VS. 12.6 +/ 6.8YEARS, P0.003). PERILESIONAL GLIOSIS WAS MORE COMMON AMONG PATIENTS IN GROUP 1 WHEN COMPARED TO GROUP 3 PATIENTS (12/17 VS. 1/10; P0.006). FIFTEEN PATIENTS UNDERWENT RESECTIVE SURGERY. AMONG GROUP 1 PATIENTS, FOUR OF FIVE BECAME SEIZURE FREE FOLLOWING LESIONECTOMY ALONE. IN GROUP 2, FOUR PATIENTS UNDERWENT ANTERIOR TEMPORAL LOBECTOMY (ATL) ALONE, OF WHOM ONE BECAME SEIZURE FREE; FIVE UNDERWENT ATL COMBINED WITH REMOVAL OF CNL (TWO OF THEM AFTER INTRACRANIAL EEG AND ALL OF THEM BECAME SEIZURE FREE, WHEREAS ONE PATIENT UNDERWENT LESIONECTOMY ALONE AND DID NOT BECOME SEIZURE FREE. SIGNIFICANCEIN ENDEMIC REGIONS, ALTHOUGH RARE, CNLS ARE POTENTIAL CAUSE FOR AED RESISTANT AND SURGICALLY REMEDIABLE EPILEPSY, AS WELL AS DUAL PATHOLOGY. PRESENCE OF PERILESIONAL GLIOSIS CONTRIBUTES TO EPILEPTOGENICITY OF THESE LESIONS. FOR THOSE PATIENTS WITH CNL AND HS, RESECTION OF BOTH LESIONS FAVORS BETTER CHANCE OF SEIZURE FREE OUTCOME.	***

HETEROGENEITY WAS MILD IN THE BLEEDING OUTCOME ANALYSIS AND ZERO IN THROMBOEMBOLISM. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF PUBLICATION BIAS IN EITHER META ANALYSIS. META ANALYSIS OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE STUDIES SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN BLEEDING AND THROMBOEMBOLISM BETWEEN INTERRUPTED DABIGATRAN AND WARFARIN THERAPY IN CA OF AF.

ASSIGNING A MONETARY COST TO DIET IS CHALLENGING, AND THERE ARE CONTRASTING METHODS IN THE LITERATURE. THIS STUDY COMPARES TWO METHODS A FOOD COST DATABASE LINKED TO 4 DAY DIET DIARIES AND AN INDIVIDUAL COST CALCULATED FROM HOUSEHOLD TILL RECEIPTS. SUBJECTS/METHODS: THE DIET AND NUTRITION TOOL FOR EVALUATION (DANTE) HAD SUPERMARKET PRICES (COST PER 100 G) ADDED TO ITS FOOD COMPOSITION TABLE. AGREEMENT BETWEEN DIET COSTS CALCULATED USING DANTE FROM FOOD DIARIES AND EXPENDITURE RECORDED USING FOOD PURCHASE TILL RECEIPTS FOR 325 INDIVIDUALS WAS ASSESSED USING CORRELATION AND BLAND ALTMAN (BA) PLOTS. RESULTS: THE MEAN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE METHODS ESTIMATES WAS 0.10 POUND. THE BA SHOWED 95% LIMITS OF AGREEMENT OF 2.88 POUND AND 3.08 POUND. EXCLUDING THE HIGHEST 5% OF DIET COST VALUES FROM EACH COLLECTION METHOD REDUCED THE MEAN DIFFERENCE TO 0.02 POUND, WITH LIMITS OF AGREEMENT RANGING FROM 2.31 POUND TO 2.35 POUND. AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE METHODS WAS STRONGER FOR MALES AND FOR ADULTS. CONCLUSIONS: DIET COST ESTIMATES USING A FOOD PRICE DATABASE WITH 4 DAY FOOD DIARIES ARE COMPARABLE TO RECORDED EXPENDITURE FROM HOUSEHOLD TILL RECEIPTS AT THE POPULATION OR GROUP LEVEL. AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL, HOWEVER, ESTIMATES DIFFERED BY AS MUCH AS 3.00 POUND PER DAY. THE METHODS AGREED LESS WHEN ESTIMATING DIET COSTS OF CHILDREN, FEMALES OR THOSE WITH MORE EXPENSIVE DIETS.	***

METHODS: ELECTRONIC DATABASES INCLUDING MEDLINE, PUBMED, AND COCHRANE CENTRAL WERE SEARCHED. THE LITERATURE RELATED TO PATIENTS WITH NFPAS TREATED WITH GKS WAS COLLECTED. ELIGIBLE STUDIES REPORTED ON THE RATE OF TUMOR CONTROL (RTC), THE RATE OF RADIOSURGERY INDUCED OPTIC NEUROPATHY INJURY (RRIONI), THE RATE OF RADIOSURGERY INDUCED ENDOCRINOLOGICAL DEFICITS (RRIED), AND OTHER PARAMETERS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 17 STUDIES MET THE CRITERIA. BASED ON THE TUMOR VOLUME, NFPAS WERE DIVIDED INTO THREE GROUPS: THE RTC OF GROUP I (93 PATIENTS) WITH TUMOR VOLUMES < 2 ML WAS 99% (95% CI 96 100%), THE RRIONI WAS 1% (95% CI 0 4%), AND THE RRIED WAS 1% (95% CI 0 4%). THE RTC OF GROUP II (301 PATIENTS) WITH VOLUMES FROM 2 TO 4 ML WAS 96% (95% CI 92 99%), THE RRIONI WAS 0 (95% CI 0 2%), AND RRIED WAS 7% (95% CI 2 14%). THE RTC OF GROUP III (531 PATIENTS) WITH VOLUMES LARGER THAN 4 ML WAS 91% (95% CI 89 94%), THE RRIONI WAS 2% (95% CI 0 5%), AND THE RRIED WAS 22% (95% CI 14 31%). THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE RTC AND IN THE RRIED AMONG THE THREE GROUPS (P<0.001), INDICATING THAT THERE WERE HIGHER RRIED AND LOWER RTC WITH THE INCREASE OF TUMOR VOLUME. CONCLUSIONS: NFPAS, ACCORDING TO TUMOR VOLUME CLASSIFICATION, NEED STRATIFICATION FOR GKS TREATMENT. GKS IS THE OPTIMAL CHOICE FOR THE TREATMENT OF GROUP II NFPAS. PATIENTS WITH RESIDUAL TUMOR VOLUMES OF < 4 ML WILL BENEFIT MOST FROM GKS TREATMENT.	***

AFTER 1 AND 5 YEARS OF GH REPLACEMENT THERAPY, SIMILAR CHANGES WERE EVIDENT WITH REGARD TO BODY COMPOSITION, FASTING GLUCOSE AND HBA1C LEVELS, QOL, AND THE LEVEL OF AND SATISFACTION WITH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ACROSS THE THREE GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS: ADULTS WITH UNTREATED COCP WITH GHD AT BASELINE DEMONSTRATED MORE CO MORBIDITIES INCLUDING GREATER ABNORMALITIES OF BODY COMPOSITION, PITUITARY HORMONE DEFICITS AND VISUAL FIELD DEFECTS. OVERALL, ADULTS WITH COCP, COH AND COE TUMOURS RESPONDED COMPARABLY TO SHORT AND LONG TERM GH REPLACEMENT THERAPY, SUGGESTING THAT PATIENTS WITH GHD DUE TO COCP BENEFITED FROM GH REPLACEMENT THERAPY TO A SIMILAR DEGREE AS THOSE WITH OTHER CAUSES OF CO HYPOTHALAMIC PITUITARY DYSFUNCTION DID.	***

TRADITIONAL IMAGING HAS MAINLY BEEN PERFORMED WITH CT AND SOMATOSTATIN RECEPTOR SCINTIGRAPHY (SRS). RECENTLY, IT HAS BECOME POSSIBLE TO USE SOMATOSTATIN RECEPTOR PET/CT (SMSR PET) INSTEAD, WHICH MIGHT IMPROVE DIAGNOSTIC QUALITY. TO EVALUATE THE DIAGNOSTIC QUALITY OF SMSR PET WE PERFORMED A META ANALYSIS AS AN UPDATE OF A PREVIOUS STUDY PUBLISHED IN 2012. A LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED SEARCHING MEDLINE, EMBASE AND FIVE OTHER DATABASES WITH A COMBINATION OF THE EXPRESSIONS PET, POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY, NEUROENDOCRINE AND NET. THE SEARCH WAS UPDATED TO 31 DECEMBER 2012. STUDIES WERE SELECTED WHICH EVALUATED THE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF SMSR PET FOR NET IN THE THORAX OR ABDOMEN WITH A STUDY SIZE OF AT LEAST EIGHT PATIENTS. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES WAS EVALUATED WITH QUADAS 2. EIGHT STUDIES FULFILLED THE INCLUSION CRITERIA AND WERE SELECTED FOR FINAL ANALYSIS, AND 14 ARTICLES FROM A PREVIOUS META ANALYSIS WERE ADDED FOR A TOTAL OF 22 ARTICLES. A TOTAL OF 2,105 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDIES, AN INCREASE FROM 567 IN THE PREVIOUS META ANALYSIS. THE POOLED SENSITIVITY WAS 93 % (95 % CI 91 94 %) AND SPECIFICITY 96 % (95 % CI 95 98 %). THE AREA UNDER THE SUMMARY ROC CURVE WAS 0.98 (95 % CI 0.95 1.0). IN THE PREVIOUS META ANALYSIS THE POOLED SENSITIVITY WAS 93 % (95 % CI 91 95 %) AND SPECIFICITY 91 % (95 % CI 82 97 %). SMSR PET HAS GOOD DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE FOR EVALUATION OF NET IN THE THORAX AND ABDOMEN, BETTER THAN SRS WHICH HAS BEEN THE PREVIOUS STANDARD METHOD. THIS META ANALYSIS GIVES FURTHER SUPPORT FOR SWITCHING TO SMSR PET.	***

CBCT IMAGES OF 60 PATIENTS BETWEEN 16 AND 36 YEARS OF AGE WERE SELECTED FROM 1400 SETS OF IMAGES IN THE DATABASE. TOMOGRAPHY WAS CARRIED OUT USING ICAT (R) (IMAGING SCIENCES INTERNATIONAL, HATFIELD, PENNSYLVANIA, USA) AND SEGMENTATION WAS CARRIED OUT BY USING MIMICS 10.1 SOFTWARE (MATERIALISE NV, LEUVEN, BELGIUM). THE TONGUE VOLUME WAS CALCULATED BY USING THE VOLUME OF THE VOXELS FROM THE SCAN AND THE NUMBER OF VOXELS SELECTED FOR A GIVEN MASK. LOWER INCISOR CROWDING WAS MEASURED WITH THE LITTLES IRREGULARITY INDEX AND DIVIDED INTO THREE GROUPS: MILD, MODERATE, AND SEVERE. INDEPENDENT SAMPLES T TEST, ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA), AND TUKEY TEST WERE USED AT P < 0.05 LEVEL. PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS AND LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL WERE CALCULATED TO DETERMINE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN TONGUE VOLUME AND INCISOR IRREGULARITY. NO SIGNIFICANT GENDER DIMORPHISM WAS FOUND FOR THE TONGUE VOLUME (FEMALES: 28.13 +/ 8.54 CM(3) AND MALES: 31.02 +/ 9.75 CM(3)). ACCORDING TO ANOVA, THERE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE TONGUE VOLUME MEASUREMENTS AMONG SUBJECTS WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF IRREGULARITY. TUKEY ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT MILD IRREGULARITY GROUP (33.97 CM(3)) SHOWED HIGHER VALUES FOR TONGUE VOLUME THAN SEVERE IRREGULARITY GROUP (26.60 CM(3); P 0.025). THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INCISOR IRREGULARITY AND TONGUE VOLUME WAS EVALUATED FOR BOTH GENDERS AND SIGNIFICANT INVERSE CORRELATION (R 0.429; P 0.029) WAS DETERMINED BETWEEN LOWER INCISOR IRREGULARITY AND TONGUE VOLUME IN MALES. IN FEMALE GROUP, NO SIGNIFI CANT CORRELATION WAS DETERMINED BETWEEN TONGUE VOLUME AND INCISOR IRREGULARITY.	***

THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REAPPRAISES PREVIOUSLY REPORTED EFFECTS OF MANDIBULAR POSITION, ASYMMETRIC OCCLUSION, AND TEMPOROMANDIBULAR DISORDERS (TMDS) ON BODY SWAY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FOR SUCH CORRELATIONS AND TO DEFINE THE POTENTIAL DIAGNOSTIC APPLICATIONS IN ORTHODONTICS. A LITERATURE SURVEY WAS PERFORMED USING THE MEDLINE, LILACS, AND SCIELO DATABASES, AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, COVERING THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1980 TO DECEMBER 2011. TWELVE ARTICLES QUALIFIED FOR THE FINAL ANALYSIS. ALL OF THESE STUDIES INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF MANDIBULAR POSITION, TWO FOCUSSED ALSO ON ASYMMETRICAL OCCLUSION, AND THREE ON TMDS. ONLY TWO STUDIES WERE JUDGED TO BE OF MEDIUM OR MEDIUM/HIGH QUALITY, WITH ALL OF THE REST CLASSIFIED AS LOW QUALITY DESIGN; NO STUDY INCLUDED FOLLOW UP. ACCORDING TO THE CONCLUSIONS OF THESE REPORTS, FOUR STUDIES SAW SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN BODY SWAY AND MANDIBULAR POSITION OR TMDS. AFTER A REAPPRAISAL OF THE FULL DATA SET, GENERALLY NO CLINICALLY RELEVANT CORRELATIONS WERE UNCOVERED IN THE COMPARISONS. WHILE MORE INVESTIGATIONS WITH IMPROVED LEVELS OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE ARE NEEDED, ACCORDING TO CURRENT EVIDENCE, THE STATIC MONITORING OF BODY SWAY AS A DIAGNOSTIC AID IN ORTHODONTICS MAY NOT BE INDICATED.	***

THE USE OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH DATA IS INCREASINGLY ALLOWING RESEARCHERS TO OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS. THIS STUDY IS AIMED AT ASSESSING ASTHMA OCCURRENCE OF A SCHOOL AGED POPULATION IN NORTHEAST ITALY USING TWO DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES. METHODS: IN 2004, A POPULATION BASED SURVEY USING A STANDARDIZED QUESTIONNAIRE WAS CONDUCTED TO ESTIMATE ASTHMA OCCURRENCE AMONG A RESIDENT POPULATION OF CHILDREN AGED 6 7 YEARS AND ADOLESCENTS AGED 13 YEARS. A SELECTION OF DISPENSED ASTHMA MEDICATIONS WAS EXTRACTED FROM ELECTRONIC DATABASES FOR A 4 YEAR PERIOD PRIOR TO QUESTIONNAIRE COMPLETION (2000 03). ASTHMA PREVALENCE WAS ESTIMATED BY COMMONLY USED QUESTIONNAIRE CLASSIFICATIONS AND COMPARED WITH USE OF INHALED BRONCHODILATORS (ALONE OR IN COMBINATION) IN VARIOUS TIME PERIODS. CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO APPROACHES WERE CALCULATED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 10 252 SUBJECTS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR ANALYSIS (85% OF THE RESIDENT POPULATION). A TOTAL OF 4747 SUBJECTS (38% OF THE RESIDENT POPULATION) WERE REGISTERED IN THE DRUG DATABASE DURING 2000 03. ASTHMA PREVALENCE WAS HIGHER IN MALES AND IN CHILDREN. CONGRUENCE BETWEEN THE TWO ENQUIRY METHODS VARIED ACCORDING TO CRITERIA APPLIED AND IMPROVED WITH THE PROTRACTION OF THE OBSERVATION PERIOD. CONCLUSION: A LONGER PERIOD FOR THE CAPTURE OF MEDICATION DATA YIELDED HIGHER CONGRUENCE. A DEGREE OF MISMATCH WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE TWO METHODS MOST LIKELY RELATED TO FACTORS OF DRUG USE AND QUESTIONNAIRE RELIABILITY. NONETHELESS, THE BENEFITS OF USING EASILY ACCESSIBLE POPULATION DATA PREVAIL, AND FURTHER STUDIES ARE WARRANTED.	***

THE INCIDENCE OF VTE IN ASIAN POPULATIONS WAS BELIEVED TO BE LOWER THAN IN CAUCASIANS, BUT THE RECENT LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT THIS IS NOT THE CASE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE INCIDENCE OF VTE IN ASIAN MAJOR TRAUMA PATIENTS AND TO EXAMINE THE MANNER OF PRESENTATION, USE OF PROPHYLAXIS AND RISK FACTORS FOR VTE. WHILE OTHER STUDIES OF VTE HAVE ADDRESSED GENERAL AND HIGH RISK POPULATIONS WITHIN ASIA, OUR STUDY IS ONE OF THE FEW TO EXAMINE ASIAN MAJOR TRAUMA PATIENTS. DATA FOR ALL PATIENTS WITH VTE WERE EXTRACTED FROM THE SINGAPORE GENERAL HOSPITAL TRAUMA DATABASE OVER A 10 YEAR PERIOD FROM 1998 TO 2007. PATIENT PROFILES AND CLINICAL FACTORS WERE COMPARED TO PATIENTS WITHOUT A DIAGNOSIS OF VTE ADMITTED WITH INJURIES IN THE SAME TIME PERIOD. THERE WERE 8,615 PATIENTS ENTERED INTO OUR DATABASE IN THIS 10 YEAR PERIOD. THIRTY FOUR PATIENTS HAD VTE, WITH AN OVERALL INCIDENCE OF 0.39 %. THIRTEEN PATIENTS HAD PULMONARY EMBOLISM, AN INCIDENCE OF 0.15 %. OF NOTE, 30 % OF PATIENTS WITH DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (DVT) PRESENTED WITH FEVER ALONE WITHOUT LIMB SYMPTOMS. ALMOST ALL 34 PATIENTS WHO DEVELOPED VTE HAD EITHER HEAD INJURY, A SPINAL CORD INJURY OR A PELVIC/EXTREMITY INJURY. EIGHTEEN PATIENTS HAD HEAD INJURY, 22 PATIENTS SUSTAINED PELVIC OR EXTREMITY INJURY, AND THREE PATIENTS HAD SPINAL CORD INJURY WITH PARAPLEGIA. HEAD INJURY AND SPINAL CORD INJURY WITH NEUROLOGIC SEQUELAE WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS FOR VTE (P < 0.05). THE INCIDENCE OF SYMPTOMATIC VTE IN THE ASIAN TRAUMA POPULATION IS NO LOWER THAN IN THE WEST. THE INCIDENCE FOUND IN THIS STUDY IS SIMILAR TO THE INCIDENCE OF VTE ACCORDING TO A STUDY USING DATA FROM THE AMERICAN NATIONAL TRAUMA DATA BANK USING SIMILAR STUDY METHODS AND WITH A SIMILAR STUDY POPULATION. IT IS ALSO HIGHER THAN THE INCIDENCE IN THE LITERATURE FOR GENERAL POST SURGICAL ASIAN PATIENTS. FEVER WAS THE PRESENTING FACTOR IN SOME PATIENTS AND SCREENING FOR VTE SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN WHEN ASSESSING FEVER IN THE TRAUMA PATIENT. THE STRONG ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HEAD INJURY, SPINAL CORD INJURY AND VTE CONFIRMS THAT WE SHOULD PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO VTE PROPHYLAXIS FOR OUR PATIENTS WITH THESE INJURIES.	***

GERMANY JOINED THE ATLS PROGRAM IN 2003. BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM, THERE WAS A CONTROVERSIAL DISCUSSION AS TO WHETHER A COUNTRY LIKE GERMANY WITH A LONG HISTORY OF TRAUMA CARE NEEDED ATLS AT ALL. 197 COURSES WITH NEARLY 3,000 PROVIDERS WERE PERFORMED UNTIL DECEMBER 2010. WE ASSESSED THE COURSE EVALUATIONS SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ATLS IN GERMANY USING THE PARTICIPANTS SYSTEMATIC FEEDBACK. DURING THE COURSE, EACH PARTICIPANT EVALUATED EACH PRESENTATION, SKILL STATION, AND SIMULATION ON A RATING SCALE FROM 1 TO 4 (1 BEING THE BEST, 4 BEING THE WORST). THE PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE EVALUATION FORMS DURING THE COURSE AND BEFORE THEY RECEIVED THEIR RESULTS. THE COURSE COORDINATOR MADE SURE THAT ALL FORMS WERE RETURNED. THE FEEDBACK FORMS WERE COLLECTED ANONYMOUSLY AND WERE ENTERED INTO A DATABASE. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING FREQUENCIES AND MEAN VALUES. THE CUMULATIVE EVALUATION OF ALL COURSES REVEALED AN AVERAGE PERFORMANCE SCORE OF 1.39 (1.06 1.86; N 197). THE LECTURES, SKILL STATIONS, AND SIMULATIONS WERE INDIVIDUALLY EVALUATED AS FOLLOWS: LECTURES 1.61 (1.00 2.81; N 197), SKILL STATIONS 1.40 (1.00 2.40; N 197), AND SURGICAL SKILL STATIONS 1.35 (1.00 2.38; N 197). PRACTICAL SKILLS SIMULATION (CASE SCENARIOS) RECEIVED THE HIGHEST GRADE OF 1.24 (1.00 1.57; N 197). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES DURING THE TIME CONCERNING THE RESULTS OF THE EVALUATION. THE OVERALL ASSESSMENT SHOWED CONSTANTLY GOOD AND EXCELLENT EVALUATIONS BY THE PARTICIPANTS OVER THE YEARS. IN GENERAL, SKILL STATIONS AND SIMULATIONS PERFORMED BETTER THAN LECTURES. ACCORDING TO THESE RESULTS, THE COURSE FORMAT IS WELL ACCEPTED BY THE PARTICIPANTS AND, THEREFORE, CAN BE RECOMMENDED TO ALL PHYSICIANS TREATING TRAUMA PATIENTS. OUR RESULTS ALSO UNDERLINE THE VALUE OF SUCH A COURSE FORMAT IN AN INDUSTRIAL COUNTRY WITH AN ALREADY ESTABLISHED TRAUMA SYSTEM.	***

ONLY ARTICLES OF LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 EVIDENCE (HOWICK ET AL. 2011) WERE INCLUDED. OTHER INCLUSION CRITERIA INCLUDED RECORDING FALLS INCIDENCE AS AN OUTCOME MEASURE, EXAMINING A COMMUNITY DWELLING POPULATION AGED 60 YEARS OR OVER AND IMPLEMENTING EXERCISE AS A SINGLE INTERVENTION IN AT LEAST ONE GROUP. EXERCISE PROGRAMME CHARACTERISTICS FROM 31 ARTICLES WERE EXAMINED ACCORDING TO THEIR FREQUENCY, INTENSITY, TIME AND TYPE AND THEIR EFFECTS ON FALLS INCIDENCE WERE REVIEWED. EXERCISING FOR A MINIMUM OF 1 H/WEEK FOR AT LEAST 40 H OVER THE COURSE OF AN INTERVENTION IS REQUIRED TO SUCCESSFULLY REDUCE FALLS INCIDENCE. THE OPTIMAL EXERCISE FREQUENCY IS THREE TIMES PER WEEK, BUT THE OPTIMAL DURATION PER BOUT REMAINS UNCLEAR. SPECIFIC BALANCE TRAINING OF SUFFICIENTLY CHALLENGING INTENSITY IS A VITAL PROGRAMME COMPONENT, AND STRENGTH TRAINING IS MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN COMBINED WITH BALANCE TRAINING. FLEXIBILITY AND ENDURANCE TRAINING MAY ALSO BE INCLUDED AS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMME. A COMBINATION OF GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL HOME EXERCISE MAY BE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR PREVENTING FALLS AND PROMOTING EXERCISE ADHERENCE.	***

ADDITIONALLY, ADHD IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS IS FREQUENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH PSYCHIATRIC COMORBIDITIES. THIS REVIEW PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE EPIDEMIOLOGY, NEUROBIOLOGY, GENETICS, DIAGNOSIS AND MOST RECENT PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES FOR TREATMENT WITH A FOCUS ON SAFETY AND EFFICACY AND DESCRIBES THE USE OF MEDICATIONS USED TO TREAT ADHD IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS. AREAS COVERED: PUBMED, COCHRANE DATABASE, ESSENTIAL EVIDENCE AND UPTODATE WERE SEARCHED FOR RELEVANT ARTICLES ABOUT STIMULANT AND NON STIMULANT PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES IN ADHD. EXPERT OPINION: DATA SUPPORTING THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF BOTH STIMULANT AND NON STIMULANT FORMULATIONS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY GROWN OVER THE PAST DECADE AND MORE EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO TAILOR MEDICATIONS TO THE NEEDS OF THE PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. PHARMACOGENOMICS RESEARCH IS EVOLVING, BUT PREDICTORS OF TREATMENT RESPONSE AND SIDE EFFECTS REMAIN LARGELY UNKNOWN. OTHER UNMET CLINICAL NEEDS INCLUDE LONG TERM FOLLOW UP STUDIES OF THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF MEDICATIONS FOR THOSE WITH ADHD ALONE, OR WITH COMORBIDITIES AND IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS INCLUDING PRESCHOOLERS.	***

RESULTS WERE MIXED, WITH TWO REPORTING EQUIVALENCE AND TWO REPORTING BENEFITS FOR MEAN COUGH SCORE (P 0.012) AND COUGH FREQUENCY (P 0.047). ONE REPORTED ADDITIONAL BENEFITS IN NON SMOKERS. ADVERSE EVENTS WERE RARE AND THERE WERE NO DATA ON PATIENT SATISFACTION OR THE SUBSEQUENT DIAGNOSIS OF ASTHMA. MOST TRIALS WERE OF UNCLEAR RISK OF BIAS. STUDY OUTCOMES WERE TOO HETEROGENEOUS TO META ANALYSE. THERE IS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO RECOMMEND THE ROUTINE USE OF INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS FOR ACUTE RTI IN ADULTS. HOWEVER, SOME TRIALS HAVE SHOWN BENEFITS, SUGGESTING THE NEED FOR FURTHER HIGH QUALITY, ADEQUATELY POWERED TRIALS.	***

THE FIVE MOST COMMON DIAGNOSES IN PRIMARY CARE (IN 2011) WERE ACUTE UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS (6.0% OF THE POPULATION), ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION (5.6%), COUGHING (2.6%), DORSALGIA (2.6%) AND ACUTE TONSILLITIS (2.4%). FEMALE TO MALE RATIOS WERE HIGHER FOR 27 OF THE 30 MOST COMMON DIAGNOSES, THE EXCEPTIONS BEING TYPE 2 DIABETES, UNSPECIFIED TYPES OF DIABETES AND MULTIPLE WOUNDS. THE 30 MOST COMMON DIAGNOSES IN PRIMARY CARE REFLECT THE COMPLEXITY OF DISORDERS CARED FOR IN THE FIRST LINE OF HEALTH CARE.

HAZARDS RATIOS (HRS) FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEATH AND DEPRESSION, PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS AND LIFESTYLE WERE ANALYSED, AND WE EXPLORED THE PROPORTION OF UNNATURAL CAUSES OF DEATHS. MORTALITY WAS STUDIED IN A COHORT OF 124 DEPRESSED AND 280 NON DEPRESSED PATIENTS 12 YEARS AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED WITH DEPRESSION IN PRIMARY CARE. MORTALITY AND THE MORTALITY RATES AND SMRS IN DEPRESSED AND NON DEPRESSED PATIENTS WERE COMPARED BY GENDER.

THE METHOD WAS APPLIED TO A DATABASE OF SARDINE LENGTH AND WEIGHT MEASUREMENTS COLLECTED FROM SOUTH AFRICAN COASTAL WATERS FROM 1953 TO 2010. STATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF THE STANDARD WEIGHT EQUATIONS WERE INVESTIGATED, AS WELL AS THEIR APPLICATION TO SARDINE. FOUR QUADRATIC STANDARD WEIGHT EQUATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED, USING MEDIANS, MEANS AND FIRST AND THIRD QUARTILES OF LOG(10) TRANSFORMED WEIGHT MEASUREMENTS (Y) PER LOG(10) TRANSFORMED CAUDAL LENGTH CLASS (X). A MODEL USING MEDIANS (Y 1.825 + 2.679X + 0.224X(2)) IS PROPOSED AS THE PREFERRED BASELINE FOR W S, VALUES FOR SOUTHERN BENGUELA SARDINE, AND IS USED TO CALCULATE W R VALUES OVER TIME AND SPACE. THE W R INDICES SHOWED PERIODS AND AREAS OF VARIED FISH CONDITION, WITH W R RANGING FROM 50 TO 150 FOR INDIVIDUAL FISH AND 97 TO 106 FOR ANNUAL AVERAGES. THE MEAN ANNUAL W R INDEX WAS LOW DURING THE 1950S AND INCREASED TO PEAK LEVELS DURING THE 1970S AND 1980S, AFTER WHICH IT SHOWED A STEADY DECLINE TO 2010. THERE WERE PRONOUNCED SPATIAL DIFFERENCES IN SARDINE W R, WITH BOTH THE LOWEST AND THE HIGHEST MEAN VALUES SEEN IN SARDINE FROM THE UPPER AND LOWER WEST COAST, RESPECTIVELY, AND FISH FROM THE SOUTHWEST AND SOUTH COAST SHOWING LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN MEAN W R. POSSIBLE CAUSES OF THESE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL DYNAMICS INCLUDE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL FACTORS. USING SARDINE AS AN EXAMPLE OF AN EXPLOITED FISH SPECIES IN A CHANGING ECOSYSTEM, WE SHOW HOW THE W R INDEX COULD INDICATE THE STATUS OF THE POPULATIONS BODY CONDITION. BODY CONDITION IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN FISH REPRODUCTION AND A PROXY FOR HABITAT QUALITY IN AN ECOSYSTEM. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON ECOSYSTEM STATUS COULD BE OBTAINED WHEN THE INDEX IS APPLIED TO OTHER POPULATIONS AND SPECIES. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.	***

ONLY THREE CHEMICALS (O BENZYL P CHLORO PHENOL, ELMIRON (R), P TOLYLUREA) WERE IDENTIFIED AS UNEQUIVOCALLY NON GENOTOXIC, MOUSE NON LIVER CARCINOGENS. A CAREFUL ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THEIR CARCINOGENICITY IN MICE IS IRRELEVANT FOR ASSESSMENT OF HUMAN CANCER HAZARDS.

THE EURL ACTIVITIES RESULTED IN THE RECENT CREATION OF A DATABASE (EURL LM DB). TYPING AND RELATED EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA SUBMITTED TO THE EURL LM DB WILL BE COLLECTED AND SHARED BY ALL THE NRLS. FOR A GIVEN NRL, THE ONLY CRITERION REQUIRED IN ORDER TO SUBMIT PULSED FIELD GEL ELECTROPHORESIS (PFGE) PROFILES TO THE DATABASE WAS THE SUCCESSFUL PARTICIPATION WITH AT LEAST ONE EURL PFGE AND PFGE PROFILE INTERPRETATION PROFICIENCY TESTING (PT) TRIAL. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE EURL ORGANIZED A PT TRIAL IN 2012 TO EVALUATE THE NRLS ABILITY TO PERFORM PFGE AND PROFILE INTERPRETATION. A TOTAL OF 18 NRLS TOOK PART IN THIS STUDY. UPON REQUEST FROM THE FOOD AND WATERBORNE DISEASES AND ZOONOSES PROGRAMME OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR DISEASE PREVENTION AND CONTROL, 10 NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH REFERENCE LABORATORIES (NPHLS) ALSO TOOK PART IN THIS PT TRIAL. OF THE 28 PARTICIPATING LABORATORIES, 16 OBTAINED RESULTS CLASSIFIED AS GOOD OR SATISFACTORY. THESE 16 LABORATORIES INCLUDED 10 NRLS (56%) AND 6 NPHLS (60%). OF THE 22 NRLS AND NHPLS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE PART OF THE PT TRIAL RELATED TO PFGE PROFILE INTERPRETATION, 11 LABORATORIES OBTAINED GOOD RESULTS. THESE 11 LABORATORIES INCLUDED EIGHT NRLS, WHICH THEREFORE CAN NOW SUBMIT PROFILES TO THE EURL LM DB. THIS PT TRIAL PROVIDED A VALUABLE OPPORTUNITY TO FACILITATE AND TO STIMULATE THE SHARING OF REPRODUCIBLE PFGE PROFILES BETWEEN HUMAN AND FOOD REFERENCE LABORATORIES.	***

THE FEATURES ARE EXTRACTED FROM SEGMENTED IRIS IMAGE USING SCALE INVARIANT FEATURE TRANSFORM (SIFT). THE KEYPOINT DESCRIPTORS EXTRACTED FROM SIFT ARE CLUSTERED INTO M GROUPS USING K MEANS. THE IDEA IS TO PERFORM INDEXING OF KEYPOINTS BASED ON DESCRIPTOR PROPERTY. DURING DATABASE INDEXING PHASE, K D TREE K DIMENSIONAL TREE IS CONSTRUCTED FOR EACH CLUSTER CENTER TAKEN FROM N IRIS IMAGES. THUS FOR M CLUSTERS, M SUCH K D TREES ARE GENERATED DENOTED AS T (I) , WHERE 1 A (C) 1/2 I A (C) 1/2 M. DURING THE RETRIEVAL PHASE, THE KEYPOINT DESCRIPTORS FROM PROBE IRIS IMAGE ARE CLUSTERED INTO M GROUPS AND ITH CLUSTER CENTER IS USED TO TRAVERSE CORRESPONDING T (I) FOR SEARCHING. K NEAREST NEIGHBOR APPROACH IS USED, WHICH FINDS P NEIGHBORS FROM EACH TREE (T (I) ) THAT FALLS WITHIN CERTAIN RADIUS R CENTERED ON THE PROBE POINT IN K DIMENSIONAL SPACE. FINALLY, P NEIGHBORS FROM M TREES ARE COMBINED USING UNION OPERATION AND TOP S MATCHES (S AS DAGGER (MX P)) CORRESPONDING TO QUERY IRIS IMAGE ARE RETRIEVED. THE PROPOSED APPROACH HAS BEEN TESTED ON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATABASES AND OUTPERFORMS THE EXISTING APPROACHES IN TERMS OF SPEED AND ACCURACY.	***

BECAUSE MANY STUDIES OF THE MICROBIOTA ARE BASED ON THE SAME BACTERIAL 16S RIBOSOMAL RNA (RRNA) GENE TARGET, THEY CAN, IN PRINCIPLE, BE COMPARED TO DETERMINE THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT DISEASE/PHYSIOLOGIC/DEVELOPMENTAL STATES. HOWEVER, DIFFERENCES IN EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOLS USED MAY PRODUCE VARIATION THAT OUTWEIGHS BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES. BY COMPARING 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCES GENERATED FROM DIVERSE STUDIES OF THE HUMAN MICROBIOTA USING THE QIIME DATABASE, WE FOUND THAT VARIATION IN COMPOSITION OF THE MICROBIOTA ACROSS DIFFERENT BODY SITES WAS CONSISTENTLY LARGER THAN TECHNICAL VARIABILITY ACROSS STUDIES. HOWEVER, SAMPLES FROM DIFFERENT STUDIES OF THE WESTERN ADULT FECAL MICROBIOTA GENERALLY CLUSTERED BY STUDY, AND THE 16S RRNA TARGET REGION, DNA EXTRACTION TECHNIQUE, AND SEQUENCING PLATFORM PRODUCED SYSTEMATIC BIASES IN OBSERVED DIVERSITY THAT COULD OBSCURE BIOLOGICALLY MEANINGFUL COMPOSITIONAL DIFFERENCES. IN CONTRAST, SYSTEMATIC COMPOSITIONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE FECAL MICROBIOTA THAT OCCURRED WITH AGE AND BETWEEN WESTERN AND MORE AGRARIAN CULTURES WERE GREAT ENOUGH TO OUTWEIGH TECHNICAL VARIATION. FURTHERMORE, INDIVIDUALS WITH ILEAL CROHNS DISEASE AND IN THEIR THIRD TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY OFTEN RESEMBLED INFANTS FROM DIFFERENT STUDIES MORE THAN CONTROLS FROM THE SAME STUDY, INDICATING PARALLEL COMPOSITIONAL ATTRIBUTES OF THESE DISTINCT DEVELOPMENTAL/PHYSIOLOGICAL/DISEASE STATES. TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT CROSS STUDY COMPARISONS OF HUMAN MICROBIOTA ARE VALUABLE WHEN THE STUDIED PARAMETER HAS A LARGE EFFECT SIZE, BUT STUDIES OF MORE SUBTLE EFFECTS ON THE HUMAN MICROBIOTA REQUIRE CAREFULLY SELECTED CONTROL POPULATIONS AND STANDARDIZED PROTOCOLS.	***

WE PRESENT A STATISTICAL FRAMEWORK TO ANALYZE RAW NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCE READS FROM PURIFIED OR MIXED ENVIRONMENTAL OR TARGETED INFECTED TISSUE SAMPLES FOR RAPID SPECIES IDENTIFICATION AND STRAIN ATTRIBUTION AGAINST A ROBUST DATABASE OF KNOWN BIOLOGICAL AGENTS. OUR METHOD, PATHOSCOPE, CAPITALIZES ON A BAYESIAN STATISTICAL FRAMEWORK THAT ACCOMMODATES INFORMATION ON SEQUENCE QUALITY, MAPPING QUALITY, AND PROVIDES POSTERIOR PROBABILITIES OF MATCHES TO A KNOWN DATABASE OF TARGET GENOMES. IMPORTANTLY, OUR APPROACH ALSO INCORPORATES THE POSSIBILITY THAT MULTIPLE SPECIES CAN BE PRESENT IN THE SAMPLE AND CONSIDERS CASES WHEN THE SAMPLE SPECIES/STRAIN IS NOT IN THE REFERENCE DATABASE. FURTHERMORE, OUR APPROACH CAN ACCURATELY DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN VERY CLOSELY RELATED STRAINS OF THE SAME SPECIES WITH VERY LITTLE COVERAGE OF THE GENOME AND WITHOUT THE NEED FOR MULTIPLE ALIGNMENT STEPS, EXTENSIVE HOMOLOGY SEARCHES, OR GENOME ASSEMBLY WHICH ARE TIME CONSUMING AND LABOR INTENSIVE STEPS. WE DEMONSTRATE THE UTILITY OF OUR APPROACH ON GENOMIC DATA FROM PURIFIED AND IN SILICO ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES FROM KNOWN BACTERIAL AGENTS IMPACTING HUMAN HEALTH FOR ACCURACY ASSESSMENT AND COMPARISON WITH OTHER APPROACHES.	***

OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS REPORT IS TO ASSESS THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS AND COST EFFECTIVENESS OF NINE GEP AND EXPANDED IHC TESTS COMPARED WITH CURRENT PROGNOSTIC TOOLS IN GUIDING THE USE OF ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH EARLY BREAST CANCER IN ENGLAND AND WALES. THE NINE TESTS ARE BLUEPRINT, BREAST CANCER INDEX (BCI), IHC4, MAMMAPRINT, MAMMOSTRAT, NPI PLUS (NPI+), ONCOTYPEDX, PAM50 AND RANDOX BREAST CANCER ARRAY. DATA SOURCES: DATABASES SEARCHED INCLUDED MEDLINE, MEDLINE IN PROCESS & OTHER NON INDEXED CITATIONS, EMBASE AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY. DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FROM JANUARY 2009 TO MAY 2011 FOR THE ONCOTYPEDX AND MAMMAPRINT TESTS AND FROM JANUARY 2002 TO MAY 2011 FOR THE OTHER TESTS. REVIEW METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE ON CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS (ANALYTICAL VALIDITY, CLINICAL VALIDITY AND CLINICAL UTILITY) AND COST EFFECTIVENESS WAS CONDUCTED. AN ECONOMIC MODEL WAS DEVELOPED TO EVALUATE THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENT GUIDED BY FOUR OF THE NINE TEST (ONCOTYPEDX, IHC4, MAMMAPRINT AND MAMMOSTRAT) COMPARED WITH CURRENT CLINICAL PRACTICE IN ENGLAND AND WALES, USING CLINICOPATHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS, IN WOMEN WITH OESTROGEN RECEPTOR POSITIVE (ER+), LYMPH NODE NEGATIVE (LN ), HUMAN EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR TYPE 2 NEGATIVE (HER2 ) EARLY BREAST CANCER. RESULTS: THE LITERATURE SEARCHES FOR CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS IDENTIFIED 5993 CITATIONS, OF WHICH 32 FULL TEXT PAPERS OR ABSTRACTS (30 STUDIES) SATISFIED THE CRITERIA FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW. A NARRATIVE SYNTHESIS WAS PERFORMED. EVIDENCE FOR ONCOTYPEDX SUPPORTED THE PROGNOSTIC CAPABILITY OF THE TEST. THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACT OF THE TEST ON DECISION MAKING AND TO SUPPORT THE CASE THAT ONCOTYPEDX PREDICTS CHEMOTHERAPY BENEFIT; HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES WERE UK BASED AND LIMITATIONS IN RELATION TO STUDY DESIGN WERE IDENTIFIED. EVIDENCE FOR MAMMAPRINT DEMONSTRATED THAT THE TEST SCORE WAS A STRONG INDEPENDENT PROGNOSTIC FACTOR, BUT THE EVIDENCE IS NON UK BASED AND IS BASED ON SMALL SAMPLE SIZES. EVIDENCE ON THE MAMMOSTRAT TEST SHOWED THAT THE TEST WAS AN INDEPENDENT PROGNOSTIC TOOL FOR WOMEN WITH ER+, TAMOXIFEN TREATED BREAST CANCER. THE THREE STUDIES APPEARED TO BE OF REASONABLE QUALITY AND PROVIDED DATA FROM A UK SETTING (ONE STUDY). ONE LARGE STUDY REPORTED ON CLINICAL VALIDITY OF THE IHC4 TEST, WITH IHC4 SCORE A HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF DISTANT RECURRENCE. THIS STUDY INCLUDED DATA FROM A UK SETTING AND APPEARED TO BE OF REASONABLE QUALITY. EVIDENCE FOR THE REMAINING FIVE TESTS (PAM50, NPI+, BCI, BLUEPRINT AND RANDOX) WAS LIMITED. THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT TREATMENT GUIDED USING IHC4 HAS THE GREATEST POTENTIAL TO BE COST EFFECTIVE AT A 20,000 POUND THRESHOLD, GIVEN THE LOW COST OF THE TEST; HOWEVER, FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED ON THE ANALYTICAL VALIDITY AND CLINICAL UTILITY OF IHC4, AND THE EXACT COST OF THE TEST NEEDS TO BE CONFIRMED. CURRENT LIMITATIONS IN THE EVIDENCE BASE PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IN THE RESULTS. ONCOTYPEDX HAS A MORE ROBUST EVIDENCE BASE, BUT FURTHER EVIDENCE ON ITS IMPACT ON DECISION MAKING IN THE UK AND THE PREDICTIVE ABILITY OF THE TEST IN AN ER+, LN , HER POPULATION RECEIVING CURRENT DRUG REGIMENS IS NEEDED. FOR MAMMAPRINT AND MAMMOSTRAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE AND THE ESTIMATES OF COST EFFECTIVENESS PRODUCED WERE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE ROBUST BY THE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT GROUP. LIMITATIONS: METHODOLOGICAL WEAKNESSES IN THE CLINICAL EVIDENCE BASE RELATE TO HETEROGENEITY OF PATIENT COHORTS AND ISSUES ARISING FROM THE RETROSPECTIVE NATURE OF THE EVIDENCE. FURTHER EVIDENCE IS REQUIRED ON THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF ALL OF THE TESTS AND ON UK BASED POPULATIONS. A KEY AREA OF UNCERTAINTY RELATES TO WHETHER THE TESTS PROVIDE PROGNOSTIC OR PREDICTIVE ABILITY. CONCLUSIONS: THE CLINICAL EVIDENCE BASE FOR ONCOTYPEDX IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST ROBUST. THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS SUGGESTED THAT TREATMENT GUIDED USING IHC4 HAS THE MOST POTENTIAL TO BE COST EFFECTIVE AT A THRESHOLD OF 20,000; POUND HOWEVER, THE EVIDENCE BASE TO SUPPORT IHC4 NEEDS SIGNIFICANT FURTHER RESEARCH.

THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META ANALYSIS, WE AIM TO ASSESS THE INCIDENCE RATE OF HEPATITIS C VIRUS INFECTION IN HEMODIALYSIS UNITS AND EXPLORE ITS POTENTIAL RISK FACTORS. FIVE ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE USED TO SEARCH ARTICLES FROM 1990 TO 2012, INCLUDING PUBMED, EMBASE, CHINA NATIONAL KNOWLEDGE INFRASTRUCTURE, CHINESE BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE DATABASE, AND WANFANG. A RANDOM EFFECTS ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ESTIMATE THE OVERALL INCIDENCE RATE OF HEPATITIS C VIRUS INFECTION. A SUBGROUP ANALYSIS AND META REGRESSION ANALYSIS WERE CONDUCTED TO EXPLORE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH HETEROGENEITY BETWEEN STUDIES. TWENTY TWO ELIGIBLE ARTICLES WERE FOUND, INCLUDING 23 INCIDENCE RATE ESTIMATES. THE OVERALL INCIDENCE RATE OF HEPATITIS C VIRUS INFECTION WAS 1.47 PER 100 PATIENT YEARS (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] 1.14 TO 1.80). IN THE SUBGROUP ANALYSIS, THE POOLED INCIDENCE RATE WAS 4.44 (CI 2.65, 6.23) PER 100 PATIENT YEARS IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD AND 0.99 (CI 0.66, 1.29) PER 100 PATIENT YEARS IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD. [CORRECTION ADDED ON 2 NOVEMBER 2012, AFTER FIRST ONLINE PUBLICATION: POOLED INCIDENCE RATE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD HAS BEEN CHANGED.] IN ADDITION, IN HEMODIALYSIS UNITS WITH HIGHER PREVALENCE, THE INCIDENCE RATE OF HEPATITIS C VIRUS INFECTION ALSO TENDED TO BE HIGHER. META REGRESSION ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE COUNTRYS DEVELOPMENT LEVEL AND INITIAL HCV PREVALENCE COMBINED COULD EXPLAIN 67.91% OF THE OBSERVED HETEROGENEITY. THE INCIDENCE RATE OF HEPATITIS C VIRUS INFECTION AMONG PATIENTS ON HEMODIALYSIS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGH. EFFORTS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO CONTROL HEPATITIS C VIRUS INFECTION IN HEMODIALYSIS UNITS, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.	***

WE UNDERTOOK A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META ANALYSIS WITH THE AIM OF DETERMINING THE RATE OF INCIDENT HCV INFECTION AND THE PREVALENCE OF ANTI HCV AMONG DETAINEES IN CLOSED SETTINGS. WE SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHED DATABASES OF PEER REVIEWED LITERATURE AND WIDELY DISTRIBUTED A CALL FOR UNPUBLISHED DATA. WE CALCULATED SUMMARY ESTIMATES OF INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE AMONG GENERAL POPULATION DETAINEES AND DETAINEES WITH A HISTORY OF INJECTION DRUG USE (IDU), AND EXPLORED HETEROGENEITY THROUGH STRATIFICATION AND META REGRESSION. THE SUMMARY PREVALENCE ESTIMATES WERE USED TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF ANTI HCV POSITIVE PRISONERS GLOBALLY. HCV INCIDENCE AMONG GENERAL DETAINEES WAS 1.4 PER 100 PERSON YEARS (PY; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]: 0.1, 2.7; K4), AND 16.4 PER 100 PY (95% CI: 0.8, 32.1; K3) AMONG DETAINEES WITH A HISTORY OF IDU. THE SUMMARY PREVALENCE ESTIMATE OF ANTI HCV IN GENERAL DETAINEES WAS 26% (95% CI: 23%, 29%; K93), AND IN DETAINEES WITH A HISTORY OF IDU, 64% (95% CI: 58%, 70%; K51). THE REGIONS OF HIGHEST PREVALENCE WERE CENTRAL ASIA (38%; 95% CI 32%, 43%; K1) AND AUSTRALASIA (35%; 95% CI: 28%, 43%; K9). WE ESTIMATE THAT 2.2 MILLION (RANGE: 1.4 2.9 MILLION) DETAINEES GLOBALLY ARE ANTI HCV POSITIVE, WITH THE LARGEST POPULATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA (668,500; RANGE: 553,500 784,000) AND EAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA (638,000; RANGE: 332,000 970,000). CONCLUSION: HCV IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN IN DETAINED POPULATIONS, WITH ONE IN FOUR DETAINEES ANTI HCV POSITIVE. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA ON THE EXTENT OF HCV INFECTION IN DETAINED POPULATIONS IS LACKING IN MANY COUNTRIES. GREATER ATTENTION TOWARDS PREVENTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT OF HCV INFECTION AMONG DETAINED POPULATIONS IS URGENTLY REQUIRED. (HEPATOLOGY 2013;58:1215 1224)	***

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFICACY BETWEEN THESE TWO REGIMENS IN CHB TREATMENT. METHODSMEDLINE, EMBASE, THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS, CHINESE BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE DATABASE, NATIONAL KNOWLEDGE INFRASTRUCTURE, WANFANG AND VIP DATABASES WERE SEARCHED UNTIL 15 APRIL 2012. ALL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCT) COMPARING IFN PLUS ADV COMBINATION THERAPY VERSUS IFN MONOTHERAPY FOR TREATING CHB PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. REVIEW MANAGER VER.5.1.0 WAS USED FOR META ANALYSIS. RESULTSOUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE RATE OF UNDETECTABLE SERUM HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) DNA WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE IFN PLUS ADV COMBINATION GROUP THAN IN THE IFN MONOTHERAPY GROUP, BOTH AT 24 WEEKS (RELATIVE RISK [RR]1.74, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]1.47 2.05, P<0.00001) AND 48 WEEKS (RR1.56, 95% CI1.35 1.80, P<0.00001) OF TREATMENT AND AFTER TREATMENT (RR1.35, 95% CI1.10 1.66, P0.004). THE SERUM HEPATITIS B E ANTIGEN (HBEAG) NEGATIVATION AND HBEAG SEROCONVERSION RATES WERE ALSO HIGHER IN THE COMBINATION GROUP. HOWEVER, A GREATER HEPATITIS B SURFACE ANTIGEN LOSS RATE WAS NOT FOUND IN THE COMBINATION GROUP. FORTY EIGHT WEEKS OF COMBINATION THERAPY IMPROVED THE ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE NORMALIZATION RATE, BUT DID NOT IMPROVE THE RATE OF UNDETECTABLE HBV DNA OR THAT OF HBEAG SEROCONVERSION AS COMPARED WITH 24 WEEKS OF COMBINATION THERAPY. CONCLUSIONBASED ON THE CURRENT STUDIES, THE EFFICACY OF IFN PLUS ADV COMBINATION THERAPY IS SUPERIOR TO IFN MONOTHERAPY.	***

DATA CONCERNING ABDOMINAL REOPERATIONS AFTER HERNIA REPAIR WERE LATER COLLECTED ON ALL 181 PATIENTS FROM THE NATIONAL DANISH HEALTH REGISTRY. POSTOPERATIVE TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED ESTIMATING POSTOPERATIVE PAIN AND PATIENT SATISFACTION. SIX % (11 PATIENTS) WERE REOPERATED BECAUSE OF MESH RELATED COMPLICATIONS. THREE HAD SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION AND ONE HAD A COLONIC FISTULA WITH MESH INFECTION, ALL CAUSING BOWEL RESECTION AND MESH REMOVAL. MESH RELATED CUTANEOUS FISTULA WAS SEEN IN ONE PATIENT. SIX PATIENTS HAD A SYMPTOMATIC RECURRENCE REQUIRING REOPERATION. ABDOMINAL WALL HEMATOMAS WERE SEEN IN TWO CASES, WHILE TWO OTHER PATIENTS HAD SYMPTOMATIC LARGE SEROMAS, OF WHICH ONE WAS DRAINED SURGICALLY. AFTER A MEDIAN FOLLOW UP OF 34 MONTHS (RANGE 12 63) IN 140 PATIENTS, 66 % WERE PAIN FREE (0 ON THE NUMERIC RATING SCALE (NRS)). OF 26 PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE PAIN (NRS > 3) AT FOLLOW UP, ONLY 4 REGRETTED THE OPERATION. SIXTEEN PATIENTS THOUGHT THEY HAD A RECURRENCE, OF THESE ONLY 3 REGRETTED THE OPERATION. THE USE OF DYNAMESH(A (R)) IN LAPAROSCOPIC VENTRAL HERNIA REPAIR WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A 6 % RISK OF MESH RELATED REOPERATION IN A HIGH VOLUME SETTING.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED WOUND/SYSTEMIC MORBIDITY, LENGTH OF STAY, DISCHARGE STATUS, AND IN HOSPITAL MORTALITY. BIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED TO ASSESS INFLUENCE OF DIABETES, OBESITY, PATIENT SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS, AND HOSPITAL CHARACTERISTICS ON THE OUTCOMES OF VHR. A TOTAL OF 78,348 ADULTS UNDERGOING ELECTIVE VHR WERE ANALYZED. OBESITY HAD SIGNIFICANT RISKS FOR CARDIOPULMONARY COMPLICATIONS AND PROLONGED HOSPITALIZATION. DIABETICS WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DELAYED WOUND HEALING. HISPANIC PATIENTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATES OF PULMONARY COMPLICATIONS AND MORTALITY. AS COMPARED TO PRIVATE INSURANCE PATIENTS, MEDICAID AND MEDICARE PATIENTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ODDS OF COMPLICATIONS, PROLONGED HOSPITALIZATION, NON ROUTINE DISCHARGE, AND MORTALITY. OBESITY AND DIABETES APPEAR TO BE SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF MORBIDITY IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING ELECTIVE VHR. ALARMINGLY, MEDICARE/MEDICAID PATIENTS NOT ONLY HAD THE HIGHEST RATES OF WOUND/SYSTEMIC COMPLICATIONS BUT ALSO THE HIGHEST POST OPERATIVE MORTALITY. FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE DEMONSTRATED THAT IN ADDITION TO COMORBIDITIES, BOTH PATIENT SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS AND HOSPITAL CHARACTERISTICS APPEAR TO BE MAJOR DETERMINANTS OF POST HERNIORRHAPHY COMPLICATIONS AND MORTALITIES.

DATA SOURCES TWO ELECTRONIC DATABASES, MEDLINE (OVIDSP) AND PUBMED, WERE SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHED. STUDY SELECTION PUBLIC HOSPITAL, HOSPITAL ACCREDITATION, AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT WERE USED AS THE SEARCH TERMS. A TOTAL OF 348 CITATIONS WERE INITIALLY IDENTIFIED. AFTER CRITICAL APPRAISAL AND STUDY SELECTION, 26 ARTICLES WERE INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW. DATA EXTRACTION THE DATA WERE EXTRACTED AND ANALYSED USING A SWOT (STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, OPPORTUNITIES, THREATS) ANALYSIS. DATA SYNTHESIS INCREASED STAFF ENGAGEMENT AND COMMUNICATION, MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM BUILDING, POSITIVE CHANGES IN ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE, AND ENHANCED LEADERSHIP AND STAFF AWARENESS OF CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT WERE IDENTIFIED AS STRENGTHS. WEAKNESSES INCLUDED ORGANISATIONAL RESISTANCE TO CHANGE, INCREASED STAFF WORKLOAD, LACK OF AWARENESS ABOUT CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, INSUFFICIENT STAFF TRAINING AND SUPPORT FOR CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, LACK OF APPLICABLE ACCREDITATION STANDARDS FOR LOCAL USE, AND LACK OF PERFORMANCE OUTCOME MEASURES. OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDED IDENTIFICATION OF IMPROVEMENT AREAS, ENHANCED PATIENT SAFETY, ADDITIONAL FUNDING, PUBLIC RECOGNITION, AND MARKET ADVANTAGE. THREATS INCLUDED OPPORTUNISTIC BEHAVIOURS, FUNDING CUTS, LACK OF INCENTIVES FOR PARTICIPATION, AND A REGULATORY APPROACH TO MANDATORY PARTICIPATION. CONCLUSIONS BY RELATING THE FINDINGS TO THE OPERATIONAL ISSUES OF ACCREDITATION, THIS REVIEW DISCUSSED THE IMPLICATIONS FOR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION AND HOW ACCREDITATION MAY DRIVE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. THESE FINDINGS HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS (GOVERNMENT, THE PUBLIC, PATIENTS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS), WHEN IT COMES TO EMBARKING ON ACCREDITATION EXERCISES.	***

IN THIS PAPER, A SUCH SYSTEM IS PROPOSED FOR WELD RADIOGRAMS IN RADIOGRAPHIC TESTING, WITH THE AIM OF SEARCHING FROM THE OVERALL IMAGE DATABASE, INTERACTIVELY WITH THE RADIOGRAPH EXPERT, DISCONTINUITIES SIMILAR TO SOME COMMON WELD DEFECT TYPES SUCH AS CRACK, LACK OF PENETRATION, POROSITY, AND SOLID INCLUSION. THEREFORE, SHAPE FEATURES CHARACTERIZING EFFICIENTLY THESE DEFECT INDICATIONS ARE REQUIRED. TWO SHAPE DESCRIPTORS ARE PROPOSED: A SHAPE GEOMETRIC DESCRIPTOR (SGD) CONSISTING OF A SET OF INVARIANT SHAPE GEOMETRIC MEASURES CHOSEN ON THE BASIS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE WELD DEFECT CLASSES AND A GENERIC FOURIER DESCRIPTOR (GFD) KNOWN FOR ITS DISCRIMINATION POWERFULNESS FOR PLANAR FILLED OBJECTS. TO IMPROVE THE WELD DEFECT RETRIEVAL RESULTS, WE PROPOSE A NEW FUSION BASED SHAPE DESCRIPTOR. THE IDEA OF THE FUSION STRATEGY IS TO EXAMINE THE COMPACTNESS AND THE RECTANGULARITY MEASURES IN SGD AND DERIVE A CRITERION PERMITTING THE DESIGN OF A NEW DESCRIPTOR F ((GFD,SGD)) ABLE TO BETTER DISCRIMINATE, PARTICULARLY, BETWEEN THE PROBLEMATIC DEFECT CLASSES OF CRACK AND LACK OF PENETRATION. EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED ON WELD DEFECT IMAGE DATABASE SHOW THE STRENGTH OF THE PROPOSED HYBRID DESCRIPTOR COMPARED TO GFD AND SGD, SIMPLY OR HIERARCHICALLY CONCATENATED OR USED SEPARATELY.	***

YET IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER WOMEN, PARTICULARLY IN LOW RESOURCE COUNTRIES, HAVE ACCESS TO THIS IMPORTANT SECOND CHANCE METHOD OF CONTRACEPTION. OBJECTIVES: TO REVIEW RELEVANT POLICIES, REGULATIONS, AND OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO ACCESS TO EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION WORLDWIDE. SEARCH STRATEGY: A WIDE RANGE OF GRAY LITERATURE WAS REVIEWED, SEVERAL SPECIFIC STUDIES WERE COMMISSIONED, AND A NUMBER OF ONLINE DATABASES WERE SEARCHED. MAIN RESULTS: SEVERAL POSITIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS ARE IN PLACE: EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION PRODUCTS ARE REGISTERED IN THE MAJORITY OF COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, LISTED IN MANY COUNTRIES ESSENTIAL MEDICINES LISTS, INCLUDED IN WIDELY USED GUIDANCE, AND SUPPORTED BY MOST DONORS. YET ANALYSIS OF DEMOGRAPHIC DATA SHOWS THAT THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN IN LOW INCOME COUNTRIES HAVE NEVER HEARD OF EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION, AND SURVEYS FIND THAT MANY PROVIDERS HAVE NEGATIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD PROVIDING EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION. CONCLUSIONS: DESPITE MORE THAN A DECADE OF CONCERTED INTERNATIONAL AND COUNTRY LEVEL EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN HAVE ACCESS TO EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION, ACCESSIBILITY REMAINS LIMITED.

OBJECTIVES: TO DETERMINE WHEN LIVER BLEEDING OCCURS DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF HELLP SYNDROME. SEARCH STRATEGY: THE ENGLISH LITERATURE WAS SEARCHED FOR ALL REPORTS OF HELLP SYNDROME ASSOCIATED WITH LIVER BLEEDING. SELECTION CRITERIA: EIGHTY SEVEN CASE SUMMARIES OF LIVER BLEEDING IN THE SETTING OF HELLP SYNDROME WERE INCLUDED. THE STANDARD DEFINITION OF HELLP SYNDROME WAS USED WITH EXPANSION INTO THE MISSISSIPPI CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM, SUPPLEMENTED BY PATIENTS WITH PARTIAL HELLP SYNDROME. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL DATA WERE COLLECTED AND RECORDED IN AN EXCEL DATABASE. MAIN RESULTS: LIVER BLEEDING WAS DETECTED IN 18 (20.7%) PATIENTS WITH CLASS 1 HELLP SYNDROME, 24 (27.6%) WITH CLASS 2 HELLP SYNDROME, AND 12 (13.8%) WITH CLASS 3 OR PARTIAL HELLP SYNDROME. IN 33 (37.9%) PATIENTS, THE EXACT CLASS OF HELLP SYNDROME AT THE TIME LIVER BLEEDING WAS DETECTED COULD NOT BE DETERMINED FROM THE PUBLISHED DESCRIPTIONS. CONCLUSIONS: LIVER BLEEDING CAN OCCUR EARLY DURING HELLP SYNDROME DEVELOPMENT, NOT ONLY IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED, CLASS 1 ILLNESS. (C) 2013 INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS.

SEARCHES WERE PERFORMED OF 4 DATABASES AND 12 REPORTS ON THE SURGICAL TREATMENT OF INTERNAL SNAPPING HIP WERE REVIEWED. THE AUTHORS TABULATED DATA ACCORDING TO YEAR OF STUDY, JOURNAL, STUDY TYPE, LEVEL OF EVIDENCE, PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, PROCEDURE, AND OUTCOMES. WE FOUND THAT SURGICAL TREATMENT OF INTERNAL SNAPPING HIP IMPROVES PATIENT SYMPTOMS IN THE MAJORITY OF PATIENTS. ENDOSCOPIC RELEASE IS ASSOCIATED WITH FEWER REPORTED COMPLICATIONS COMPARED WITH OPEN RELEASE. ALL STUDIES OF ENDOSCOPIC TREATMENT OF INTERNAL SNAPPING HIP SYNDROME ALSO PERFORMED INTRA ARTICULAR EXAMINATION AND TREATMENT OF INTRA ARTICULAR PATHOLOGY. THE INCIDENCE OF ASSOCIATED INTRA ARTICULAR PATHOLOGY WAS REPORTED IN 5 OF 6 STUDIES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT A PAINFUL SNAPPING ILIOPSOAS TENDON IN MANY CASES MAY BE A RESULT OF INTRA ARTICULAR HIP PATHOLOGY RATHER THAN AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY. EARLY STUDIES SUGGEST NO DIFFERENCE IN EFFICACY OR ASSOCIATED COMPLICATIONS RATE WHEN COMPARING EXTRACAPSULAR TO TRANSCAPSULAR ILIOPSOAS TENDON RELEASE. FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED COMPARING OPERATIVE TO NONOPERATIVE TREATMENT AND METHODS OF DETERMINING PATIENTS LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM OPERATIVE INTERVENTION.	***

FIRST, THE CURRENT STATUS OF ZOO ANIMAL WELFARE ASSESSMENT WAS REVIEWED, AND THE BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY APPROACH WAS OUTLINED. IN THIS APPROACH, DATABASES OF SPECIES CHARACTERISTICS WERE DEVELOPED USING (A) LITERATURE OF NATURAL BEHAVIOR AND (B) CAPTIVE BEHAVIOR. SPECIES CHARACTERISTICS WERE GROUPED IN 8 FUNCTIONAL BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGICAL FITNESS RELATED CATEGORIES: SPACE, TIME, METABOLIC, SAFETY, REPRODUCTIVE, COMFORT, SOCIAL, AND INFORMATION ADAPTATIONS. ASSESSMENTS OF THE STRENGTH OF BEHAVIORAL ADAPTATIONS IN RELATION TO ENVIRONMENTAL DEMANDS WERE MADE BASED ON THE RESULTS AVAILABLE FROM THE LITERATURE. THE DATABASES WITH LITERATURE AT THE SPECIES LEVEL WERE COUPLED WITH DATABASES OF (C) BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS AND (D) WELFARE ASSESSMENTS UNDER CAPTIVE CONDITIONS. OBSERVATION AND WELFARE ASSESSMENT METHODS WERE ADAPTED FROM THE ANIMAL ON THE FARM REALM AND APPLIED TO ZOO SPECIES. IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THE COMPARISON OF THE REPERTOIRE OF BEHAVIORS IN NATURAL AND CAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS WOULD HIGHLIGHT WELFARE PROBLEMS, PROVIDE SOLUTIONS TO WELFARE PROBLEMS BY ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES, AND IDENTIFY SPECIES CHARACTERISTICS UNDERLYING ZOO ANIMAL WELFARE PROBLEMS.	***

HUNDREDS OF OBSERVED WET SNOW ICING EVENTS ARE LOGGED IN DETAIL IN AN ICING DATABASE, MOST OF WHICH INCLUDE AN ESTIMATE OF THE MEAN AND MAXIMUM DIAMETER OF OBSERVED ICING ON OVERHEAD POWER CONDUCTORS. OBSERVATIONS OF WEATHER ARE FURTHERMORE AVAILABLE FROM A DENSE NETWORK OF WEATHER STATIONS. THE EXISTING MODELS FOR WET SNOW ACCRETION ON A STANDARD CYLINDER ARE UPDATED WITH REALISTIC VALUES FOR THE TERMINAL FALL SPEED OF WET SNOWFLAKES TOGETHER WITH A SNOWFLAKE LIQUID FRACTION BASED CRITERION TO IDENTIFY WET SNOW. THE WIDELY USED PARAMETERIZATION OF THE STICKING EFFICIENCY IS FOUND TO STRONGLY UNDERESTIMATE THE ACCRETION RATE. A CALIBRATED PARAMETERIZATION OF THE STICKING EFFICIENCY IS SUGGESTED ON THE BASIS OF LONG TERM STATISTICS OF OBSERVED AND MODELED WET SNOW LOADS. APPLICATION OF THE IMPROVED METHOD IS DEMONSTRATED IN A HIGH RESOLUTION SIMULATION FOR A CASE OF OBSERVED WIDESPREAD AND INTENSIVE WET SNOW ICING IN SOUTH ICELAND. THE RESULTS FORM A BASIS FOR MAPPING THE CLIMATOLOGY OF WET SNOW ICING IN THE COMPLEX TERRAIN OF ICELAND AS WELL AS FOR PREPARING OPERATIONAL FORECASTS OF WET SNOW ICING AND SEVERE WEATHER FOR OVERHEAD POWER TRANSMISSION LINES IN COMPLEX TERRAIN.	***

AS PART OF THAT EFFORT, THIS STUDY SOUGHT DOCUMENTS OF TEMPERATURE OBSERVATIONS FOR THE NATION OF UGANDA. ALTHOUGH SCATTERED REPORTS WERE FOUND FOR THE 1890S, CONSISTENT RECORD KEEPING APPEARS TO HAVE BEGUN IN 1900. DATA WERE KEYED IN FROM IMAGES OF SEVERAL TYPES OF OLD FORMS AS WELL AS ACCESSED ELECTRONICALLY FROM SEVERAL SOURCES TO EXTEND THE TIME SERIES OF 32 STATIONS WITH AT LEAST 4 YR OF DATA BACK AS FAR AS DATA WERE AVAILABLE. IMPORTANT GAPS STILL REMAIN; 1979 93 HAS VIRTUALLY NO OBSERVATIONS FROM ANY STATION. BECAUSE MANY STATIONS WERE REPRESENTED BY MORE THAN ONE DATA SOURCE, A SCHEME IS DESCRIBED TO EXTRACT THE BEST GUESS VALUES FOR EACH STATION OF MONTHLY AVERAGES OF THE DAILY MAXIMUM, MINIMUM, AND MEAN TEMPERATURE. A PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF THE NATIONAL TIME SERIES INDICATES THAT, SINCE THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY, IT APPEARS THAT UGANDA EXPERIENCED ESSENTIALLY NO CHANGE IN MONTHLY AVERAGE DAILY MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE BUT DID EXPERIENCE A CONSIDERABLE RISE IN MONTHLY AVERAGE DAILY MINIMUM TEMPERATURE, CONCENTRATED IN THE LAST THREE DECADES. BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY GAPS IN THE DATA, IT IS HOPED THAT READERS WITH INFORMATION ON EXTANT DATA THAT WERE NOT DISCOVERED FOR THIS STUDY WILL CONTACT THE AUTHOR OR THE PROJECT SO THAT THE DATA MAY BE ARCHIVED.	***
