Noda T., Xu B., Asaoka A.	Acceleration generation due to strain localization of saturated clay specimen based on dynamic soil-water coupled finite deformation analysis	2013	Soils and Foundations								http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84884756027&partnerID=40&md5=a290335889bb6bcb0d4badee8401f947	Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan; Association for the Development of Earthquake Prediction, Tokyo, Japan	Noda, T., Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan; Xu, B., Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan; Asaoka, A., Association for the Development of Earthquake Prediction, Tokyo, Japan	In the conventional bifurcation and strain localization analyses of geomaterials, the inertia forces are generally ignored, based on the quasi-static equilibrium equation. Even though a great deal of literature exists on dynamic strain localization analyses, information on acceleration generation during the formation of shear bands has not been emphasized. Inspired by the acoustic emission phenomenon in laboratory tests and the seismic acceleration related to the slippage of faults, a dynamic soil-water coupled strain localization analysis is performed in the present paper on a saturated rectangular clay specimen subjected to constant cell pressure under plane strain conditions, employing the SYS Cam-clay model as the elasto-plastic constitutive model for the soil skeleton. An initial geometrical imperfection was introduced to the specimen to trigger one single shear band, and the following results were found: (1) Two types of oscillation occurred within the specimen during acceleration when the specimen was subjected to compression deformation at a constant rate, namely, (a) one caused by the sudden external compression and (b) the second induced by the formation of strain localization/a shear band. With the occurrence of the shear band, if, for example, the vertical rate was equivalent to about 10 cm/s, the accelerations that occurred within the specimen were in the order of several thousand gal, which is similar to those measured during earthquakes; (2) The effects of the time increment, the mesh division, the initial confining pressure, the OCR and the stress-control loading on the generated acceleration in (b) were investigated in detail. It was found that under stress control, even though the formation of the shear band was similar to that under displacement control, the induced acceleration behaved quite differently. © 2013 Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The use of geosynthetics inevitably involves the coupled behaviors of different materials which include large displacement and strain-softening behaviors, etc. Current research indicates that the behavior of geosynthetic-soil systems depend on the shear strength of the interface governed by several intrinsic and environmental factors, such as moisture, normal stress, chemical conditions, and thermal components, etc. In this study, the effects of acidity and basicity from leachate and waste are intensively considered in order to build up the chemical reaction mechanism of the shear strength of the interface under cyclic loading based on an experimental inspection. The Multi-Purpose Interface Apparatus (M-PIA) has been newly manufactured, and cyclic direct shear tests for submerged geosynthetic-soil specimens under different chemical conditions have been performed. A Focused Ion Beam (FIB) analysis has also been performed to induce the reason for the variation in the disturbance function and to verify the hypothesis on the decay-proof ability of geosynthetics. Consequently, a new approach to reflect the chemical effect of geosynthetics has been applied by suggesting the use of new disturbance function parameters in the Disturbed State Concept. The basic schematic of the Disturbed State Concept (DSC) constitutive model is employed; then, new disturbance function parameters are proposed to describe the chemical degradation of the geosynthetic-soil interface under dynamic conditions. Furthermore, based on the FIB results, it is be deduced that the variation in the disturbance function mainly results from the different types of decay in the soil minerals. © 2013 Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Based on the RFEA simulation results for 34 (idealized) real engineered slope cases, it is concluded that the coefficient of variation in the spatially variable shear strength and the ratio (vertical scale of fluctuation)/(length of failure curve) have a major effect on the stability reliability. The RFEA simulation results are further used to derive simplified equations for the reliability analysis and the reliability-based design of undrained engineered slopes. © 2013 Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Laboratory measurements of small strain properties of dry sands by bender element	2013	Soils and Foundations								http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84884679794&partnerID=40&md5=4bfe03d226acde6b671d54900a45fc77	Department of Geotechnical Engineering and Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Engineering of the Ministry of Education, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China; Department of Civil Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China	Gu, X., Department of Geotechnical Engineering and Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Engineering of the Ministry of Education, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China; Yang, J., Department of Civil Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China; Huang, M., Department of Geotechnical Engineering and Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Engineering of the Ministry of Education, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China	The S-wave and P-wave velocities in dry sands are simultaneously measured by a single pair of bender elements (BE) incorporated into a standard resonant column (RC) apparatus with a torsional shear (TS) function. The small strain properties, including shear modulus G0, constrained modulus M0 and Poisson's ratio υ, are determined for specimens at various densities and confining pressures. The results show that the G0 values obtained from the BE tests agree well with those from RC and TS tests, indicating the reliability of the signal interpretation and the testing system. Furthermore, the G0 data of the present test series is in good agreement with the data from the literature. The results also show that G0 increases faster than M0 as the soil density and the confining pressure increase. In terms of Poisson's ratio, it decreases with an increasing soil density and confining pressure and generally lies in the range of 0.18-0.32 for the tested sands. Empirical equations are established to approximately estimate Poisson's ratio from the measured G0 or M0 values. © 2013 Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The proposed formulation is based on Rankine's conjugate stress concept, without employing any additional assumptions. The developed expressions can be used for the static and pseudo-static seismic analyses of c-φ backfill. The results based on the proposed formulations are found to be identical to those computed with the Mononobe-Okabe method for cohesionless soils, provided the same wall friction angle is employed. For c-φ soils, the formulation yields comparable results to available solutions for cases where a comparison is feasible. Design charts are presented for calculating the net active horizontal thrust behind a rigid wall for a variety of horizontal pseudo-static accelerations, values of cohesion, soil internal friction angles, wall inclinations, and backfill slope combinations. The effects of the vertical pseudo-static acceleration on the active earth pressure and the depth of tension cracks have also been explored. In addition, examples are provided to illustrate the application of the proposed method. © 2013 Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Using this testing apparatus, plane strain compression tests were performed on pure Toyoura sand and methane hydrate-bearing sand with localized deformation measurements. From the results, it was observed that the methane hydrate-free specimens, despite their relatively high density, showed changes in compressive volume. Marked increases in the initial stiffness and strength of the methane hydrate-bearing sand were observed (methane hydrate saturation of SMH =60%). Moreover, the volumetric strain changed from compressive to dilative. For the specimens with methane hydrate, a dilative behavior above SMH =0% was observed. An image analysis showed that the shear bands of the methane hydrate-bearing sand were thinner and steeper than those of the host sand. In addition, the dilative volumetric strain in the shear band increased markedly when methane hydrate existed in the pore spaces. © 2013 Japanese Geotechnical Society.

For this purpose, a custom-built inter-particle loading apparatus was designed and constructed, the main features of which are described briefly in this paper. This apparatus is capable of performing shearing tests at the contacts of soil minerals of a particle-particle type in the range of very small displacements, from less than 1 μm to about 300 μm, and very small normal loads, between about less than 1 N and 15 N. The laboratory data showed that the effects of the normal force and the sliding velocity on the coefficient of dynamic friction are not significant, while dry and saturated surfaces had similar frictional characteristics. The steady state sliding was mobilized within a range of 0.5-3.0 μm of horizontal displacement, and the coefficient of static friction was very similar to the corresponding coefficient during constant shearing. Repeating the inter-particle shearing tests on the same particles and following the same shearing track indicated a small reduction in the inter-particle coefficient of friction after the first shearing, which is possibly related to plastic deformation and damage to the asperities. © 2013 Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The results show that the orientation pattern before shearing is nearly random, although there may be some degree of preferred orientation caused by the overburden pressure. Becoming higher towards the failure plane, the degree of preferred orientation sharply increases in both tests as the compression increases until failure. It was discovered that in the consolidated undrained tests, failure occurs at higher levels of strain than previously believed, while in the consolidated drained tests, failure occurs at much lower levels of strain than previously believed. The results indicate the formation of a wider deformation zone towards and at failure in the drained tests. This is probably because particles in the drained tests have enough time to respond to the applied shear stress and change their orientation accordingly. This may explain the formation of wider deformation zones along creeping (aseismic) faults and narrow zones along seismic faults whose mechanisms are analogous to the drained and undrained tests, respectively. © 2013 Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The distribution of the soil reactions on a simple planar failure surface is obtained through the use of Kötter's equation, and the pseudo-dynamic approach is used to obtain the net seismic vertical uplift capacity factor for the unit weight component of the soil (Fγd ). The results for the static and seismic vertical uplift capacity factors are determined for various combinations of input parameters, such as the load inclination, the soil friction angle, the embedment ratio, the soil amplification and both horizontal and vertical pseudo-dynamic seismic accelerations. It is observed that the orientation of the load significantly affects the seismic uplift capacity of the horizontal strip anchor. Fγd is seen to decrease with an increase in both horizontal and vertical seismic accelerations and soil amplification, whereas it is seen to increase with an increase in the embedment ratio and the soil friction angle, as expected. The results in terms of the non-dimensional net seismic uplift capacity factor are presented in graphical and tabular forms. The present results are compared and found to be in good agreement with similar results available in literature. © 2013 Japanese Geotechnical Society.

In the ND-CPT, the density is determined by the count rate ratio (R? ) of the gamma rays detected by the detector to the gamma rays from the source. Thus, the ND-CPT measures the average wet density of the material within a spheroid volume around the central point of the source and the detector, which is designated as ?c. The measured ?c values are considerably different from the actual ? of the seabed sediment because the density varies significantly with depth. We designate the layer of seabed sediment in which the density increases rapidly with depth as the upper layer and the layer below it as the lower layer. A method is proposed to deduce the actual ? profile from the measured ?c profile. The upper and the lower boundaries of the upper layer of the seabed sediment can be directly determined from the measured ?c profile as well as the distance (2b) between the gamma ray source and the detector. Based on the results of a back analysis of the measured ?c profile at Isahaya Bay, Ariake Sea, Japan, the density distribution in the upper layer of the seabed sediment can be approximated as a square root function of depth. Comparisons of the measured ?c profiles, obtained using the ND-CPT, and the actual ? profiles, deduced by the proposed method, show that the actual ? are obviously different from the measured ?c near the upper and the lower boundaries of the upper layer of the seabed sediment. The thickness of the upper layer of the seabed sediment at Isahaya Bay lies in the range of 0.05-0.55 m. © 2013 Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The experimental tests were conducted in a modified oedometer under two different surcharge pressures (10 and 20 kPa). During the tests, the samples were inundated with different types of wetting fluids (distilled water, saline water and acidic water). The volumetric deformation, void ratio and water content of the samples were determined during cycles of wetting and drying. The results show that the swelling potential increases with an increasing number of wetting and drying cycles. The effect of the distilled water on the swelling potential is not the same as that of the saline water or the acidic water, particularly for different surcharge pressures. The variations in void ratio and water content show that, at the equilibrium condition, the wetting and drying paths converge to nearly an S-shaped curve. This curve consists of a linear portion and two curved portions, and the majority of the deformation is located between the saturation curves of 90% and 40%. © 2013 Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Fabric effect on hydraulic conductivity of kaolin under different chemical and biochemical conditions	2013	Soils and Foundations								http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84884275270&partnerID=40&md5=80896cd8058e433c9d3897a4b7faf7b9	Department of Civil Engineering, University of Ottawa, Canada; GSGES, Kyoto University, Japan	Li, Z., Department of Civil Engineering, University of Ottawa, Canada; Katsumi, T., GSGES, Kyoto University, Japan; Inui, T., GSGES, Kyoto University, Japan; Takai, A., GSGES, Kyoto University, Japan	A reasonably less permeable compacted clay liner (CCL) is critical to the long-term safety of waste containment facilities. This study experimentally investigates a variety of factors, including salinity, pH, fluctuation in permeant, permeation duration and presence of microorganisms, that are found to influence the hydraulic conductivity (k) of consolidated kaolin and the fabrics of suspended kaolin. Amongst these factors, a reduction in hydraulic conductivity of up to 4 orders of magnitude is obtained from the modification of the microfabrics of kaolin; a reduction of 2 orders of magnitude is brought about by bioclogging; a reduction of 1 order of magnitude is related to the concentrated Ca solution (&gt;10 mM). The hydraulic conductivity of consolidated kaolin can obviously be changed by adjusting the fabrics of the kaolin particles, e.g., clogging the pore spaces with bioslurry, permeating them with alkaline solution, or transforming the kaolin into metakaolin. An effluent pH larger than the isoelectric point (pHIEP) leads to a rapid reduction in k until 1×10-11 m/s. A 3-dimensional fabric map was established for kaolin suspension in contact with a wide range of Ca concentrations and pH levels. The fabrics of kaolin suspension are predominated by a salt concentration (C&gt;2.0 mM) and a pH solution (C&lt;2.0 mM), respectively. © 2013 Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Coupled analysis of bifurcation and shear band in saturated soils	2013	Soils and Foundations								http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84880670423&partnerID=40&md5=3a166604d7da21432b9db1bbf99c597d	Department of Civil Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ont., Canada	Guo, P., Department of Civil Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ont., Canada; Stolle, D.F.E., Department of Civil Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ont., Canada	The focus of this study is the analysis of the onset of a shear band in saturated soils under biaxial stress conditions taking into account bifurcation in both pore pressure and soil skeleton. By considering the saturated soil as a two-phase medium, the inhomogeneous displacement and pore pressure fields are assumed to be nonlinear and satisfy the continuity conditions of displacements, displacement gradients and excess pore pressure on the boundaries of the band. It is shown that bifurcation may take place in loose, contractive soils in the form of two-phase diffuse mode or localized mode of soil skeleton deformation. For low permeability saturated soils, the onset of a shear band occurs at peak friction, with the shear band parallel to Coulomb's failure plane. Numerical examples using a simple stress-strain model are given to demonstrate the occurrence of the onset of a shear band and its inclination, as a function of the void ratio and the initial consolidation pressure. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The mixture of CCR and FA can produce a cementitious material because CCR contains a large amount of Ca(OH)2 while FA is a pozzolanic material. Soil stabilization by CCR is classified using three zones: active, inert and deterioration. In the active zone, the natural pozzolanic material in the soil is adequate to produce a pozzolanic reaction. Hence, the input of FA into this zone does not significantly improve strength. Strength in the inert zone can be significantly increased by adding FA. FA improves the densification and pozzolanic reaction. The deterioration zone is not recommended for use in practice, even with the input of FA. The unsoundness due to free lime hinders strength development. Although the soaked and unsoaked strengths depend mainly on the CCR and FA contents, most of the ratios of soaked strength to unsoaked strength vary between 0.45 and 0.65. It is proved that a mixture of CCR and FA can be used for soil stabilization instead of ordinary Portland cement. The possible mechanism regarding the control of strength development presented in this paper can be applied to other clayey soils stabilized with different cementitious materials produced from Ca(OH)2-rich and pozzolanic materials. This putative mechanism is also fundamental for further studies involving the development of rational dosage methodologies. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Assessment of K0 correlation to strength for granular materials	2013	Soils and Foundations								http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84880579580&partnerID=40&md5=7031bb2c0ef81bf0e8564036e10b7275	School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea	Lee, J., School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Yun, T.S., School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Lee, D., School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Lee, J., School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea	The coefficient of lateral stress at rest K0 is a state soil variable, yet is well correlated to strength. As different types of friction angles can be defined, it is important to examine the applicability of K0-strength correlation and further clarify the mechanism of K0-stress state. In this study, the values of K0 were experimentally investigated for different types of granular materials, focusing on its correlation to material strength and the effect of particle shape and surface roughness. For this purpose, laboratory tests were conducted to directly measure K0 of natural sand, spherically shaped glass bead, and surface-etched glass bead packings under various stress and soil conditions. Triaxial and other basic property tests were also conducted to characterize the test granular materials. It was revealed that the effect of material density on K0 differed depending on the stress history whereas the effect of particle surface roughness, within the range considered in this study, was relatively small. Test results highlight that the values of the friction angle employed into Jaky's K0 equation to match measured K0 values are not unique, showing a state-dependent aspect. Inter-particle stress analysis was introduced to assess the correlation of K0 to the friction angle as postulated by Jaky's K0 equation. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The shear modulus at small strain (Gmax ) and the reference shear strain parameter (γ0.7) are, for instance, two of the input parameters in a finite element analysis with the hardening soil model with small strain stiffness. The stiffness and strength parameters for the hardening soil model of soft and stiff Bangkok Clays has recently been published (Surarak et al., 2012). This paper is a continuation on the previous study on the stiffness of Bangkok Clay, and focuses on the small strain characteristics. The data are from the Bangkok MRT Blue line project as well as comprehensive studies at Chulalongkorn University and the Asian Institute of Technology. Based on these laboratory and field testing data, the parameters Gmax and γ0.7 can be determined using well-known empirical correlations and the concept of threshold shear strain. Finally, a comparison between the measured data and predictions is made. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

In this paper, an analytic model for the ultimate resistance of micropile is proposed, based on a beam-column equation and an existing p-y curve method. As such, an iterative process to find the bending moment and shear capacity of the micropile section has been developed. The formulation for calculating the inner force and deflection of the micropile using the finite difference method is derived. Special attention is given to determine the spacing of micropiles with the aim of achieving the ultimate shear capacity of the micropile group. Thus, a new design method for micropiles for earth slope stabilization is proposed that includes details about choosing a location for the micropiles within the existing slope, selecting micropile cross section, estimating the length of the micropile, evaluating the shear capacity of the micropiles group, calculating the spacing required to provide force to stabilize the slope and the design of the concrete cap beam. The application of the method to an embankment landslide in Qinghai province, China, is described, and monitoring data indicated that slope movement had effectively ceased as a result of the slope stabilization measure, which verified the effectiveness of the design method. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

This was made possible with the industrial production of piezo-ceramic elements in various shapes and sizes. This paper describes the development of a single flat disk shaped piezo-ceramic transducer for measuring both compression and shear wave on an identical soil specimen. Procedures for interpreting results, initial verifications of its performance and applications are also presented. Two types of piezo-ceramic elements, one for measuring P waves and the other for S waves, were placed together in a metal housing, which worked as a wave measuring transducer installed in a triaxial apparatus. Three kinds of granular geo-materials, fine, medium-coarse and coarse sands, were tested. Small strain shear stiffness, Gmax, of the tested sands was evaluated by various techniques, including proposed disk transducer method, trigger and accelerometer method and traxial small strain cyclic loading. Shear moduli obtained from all the techniques fell in a similar range within allowable scatters and it was confirmed that the disk transducer was one of applicable wave measurement technique for laboratory soil specimens. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

With respect to the design of pile foundations, the ability to accurately predict pile setup may lead to more economical pile design, resulting in a reduction in pile length, pile section, and size of driving equipment. In this paper, an ANN model was developed for predicting pipe pile setup using 104 data points, obtained from the published literature and the author's own files. In addition, the paper discusses the choice of input and internal network parameters which were examined to obtain the optimum ANN model. Finally, the paper compares the predictions obtained by the ANN with those given by a number of empirical formulas. It is demonstrated that the ANN model satisfactorily predicts the measured pipe pile setup and significantly outperforms the examined empirical formulas. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

A numerical analysis using the distinct element method (DEM) is carried out to investigate the effects of pile diameter and the elastic modulus, discontinuity spacing and the inclination of rock mass on the point bearing behavior. The emphasis is quantifying the point bearing mechanism by taking rock discontinuity into consideration based on field loading tests performed on 39 instrumented piles. A new hyperbolic q-w function is proposed considering the point bearing resistance influence factors, including rock mass discontinuity. Through comparisons with other field data, the proposed q-w function represents a significant improvement in the prediction of the point bearing load transfer characteristics of jointed rock-socketed drilled shafts. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

A Galerkin solution and a layered transfer matrix solution for the tunnel-soil-pipeline interaction are given in order to compare the effects of soil stratifications on the pipeline behavior subjected to tunnel-induced soil movements. For the Galerkin solution, the soil is modeled by the modulus of subgrade reaction and the governing differential equations are converted to finite element equations using the Galerkin method. To take full consideration for non-homogeneous soil characteristics, a layered soil model is employed in the layered transfer matrix solution by applying the double Laplace transform and transfer matrix method. The differences between the two proposed solutions are verified with several examples including centrifuge modeling tests, finite difference numerical analysis and measured data in situ. Furthermore, the parametric analysis to existing pipelines in several representative layered soils in Shanghai is also carried out. The results discussed in this paper indicate that the Galerkin solution can estimate the pipeline mechanical behavior affected by tunneling in homogeneous soil with good precision. The layered transfer matrix solution is more suitable to simulate the soil stratifications on the pipeline behavior than the Galerkin solution. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The main objective of this paper is to extend internal stability criteria for well-graded and gap-graded soils using control variables selected based on a physical understanding of the microstructures of the soils. The feasibility of three commonly used geometric criteria is first evaluated based on the information of 131 soils in a laboratory test dataset. The control variables for soils of various fines contents are then identified based on their microstructures. Finally, composite internal stability criteria for both well-graded and gap-graded soils are proposed. A well-graded soil with a fines content of less than 5% is internally stable if it satisfies (H/F)min&gt;1.0 (F=mass fraction of particles finer than grain size d, H=mass fraction of particles ranging from d to 4d). A gap-graded soil with a fines content of less than 10% is internally stable if its gap ratio is smaller than 3.0. A well-graded soil with a fines content of more than 20% or a gap-graded soil with a fines content of more than 35% is deemed to be internally stable. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

China	Wu, X.Z., Department of Applied Mathematics, School of Applied Science, University of Science and Technology Beijing, 30 Xueyuan Road, Haidan District, Beijing 100083, P.R. China	An important issue in the probabilistic prediction modelling of multivariate soil properties (usually including cohesion, friction angle, and unit weight) is the measurement of dependence structure among these properties. The use of Pearson's correlation as a dependence measure has several pitfalls; therefore, it may not be appropriate to use probabilistic prediction models in geotechnical engineering problems based on this correlation. As an alternative, a copula-based methodology for prediction modelling and an algorithm to simulate multivariate soil data are proposed. In this method, all different random variables are transformed to a rank/uniform domain in order to form a copula function by applying cumulative distribution function transformations. The technique of copulas, representing a promising alternative for solving multivariate problems to describe their dependence structure by a ranked correlation coefficient, is highlighted. Two existing observed soil data sets from river banks are used to fit a trivariate normal copula and a trivariate fully nested Frank copula. The ranking correlation coefficient Kendall's τ and the copula model parameters are estimated. The goodness-of-fit test to choose the best-fitting model is discussed. A series of triplet samples (i.e., cohesion, friction angle, and unit weight) simulated from the trivariate normal copula with flexible marginal distributions are used as input parameters to evaluate the uncertainties of soil properties and to define their correlations. The influence of the cross-correlation of these soil properties on reliability-based geotechnical design is demonstrated with two simple geotechnical problems: (a) the bearing capacity of a shallow foundation resting on a clayey soil and (b) the stability of a cohesive-frictional soil in a planar slope. The sensitivity analysis of their correlations of random variables on the influence of the reliability index provides a better insight into the role of the dependence structure in the reliability assessment of geotechnical engineering problems. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The aim of this study is to clarify the failure mechanisms of volcanic slopes caused by both rainfall and freeze-thaw action in cold regions such as Hokkaido. Using model slopes of different shapes formed by volcanic soils, a series of rainfall tests are conducted under field conditions in which a spray nozzle is used to simulate rainfall intensity. Test results show that the surface failure of volcanic slopes differs depending strongly on the angle and the initial moisture content of the slopes. Based on the results of the model testing, the effects of freezing and thawing on the failure mechanism are drawn upon to propose an evaluation method for slope stability. In consideration of the model test results, it is found that the formation of a frozen layer and the softening of the slope surface, due to the freeze-thaw action, are significant for the stability of volcanic slopes in cold regions, and that slope failure can be uniquely assessed by the changes in water content in zones subjected to rainfall and freeze-thaw action. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The soil was consolidated with K of 0.5, where K is the ratio of cell pressure to axial pressure. The tests included drained constant η (q/p′) loading tests and undrained and drained triaxial compression and extension shear tests on anisotropically consolidated specimens. It was found that the anisotropically consolidated Shanghai clay obeys Rendulic's principle under compression loading, but not under extension loading, and that the yield surface inclined inside the state boundary surface under extension loading. Moreover, the pre-yield behavior and the post-yield behavior were found to be very different under these two loading conditions (compression and extension loading). The test results confirm the validity of the sloping elastic wall theory, and the influence of anisotropic parameter β on the shape of the yield curve in the p′-v plane was also studied in the paper. Constitutive modeling methods for anisotropic consolidated soils were also discussed based on the test results. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

A new laboratory apparatus for investigating dynamic compaction has been designed and fabricated. The basic principle of this new technique is to introduce vibrations during the expansion process in static compaction grouting. In these tests, the injection pressure, the excess pore water pressure, and the change in void ratio of the specimens are measured. The main focus is to investigate the development of the injection pressure, the void ratio, and the excess pore water pressure due to dynamic compaction and the subsequent consolidation of the soils. In addition, the relative density of the soils is used to evaluate the dynamic compaction efficiency. Scaled laboratory experiments are conducted to study the effect of this dynamic compaction frequency on compaction efficiency. The experimental results show that the change in void ratio in the dynamic compaction tests is about four times greater than that in the static compaction tests. Dynamic compaction frequency plays an important role in soil densification due to dynamic compaction. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

Marine foundations modeled independently for the 1st and 2nd phase islands, considering the increase in thickness of the individual layers toward the offshore area, are proposed for the finite element analyses. The mechanism for the propagation of excess pore water pressure, due to the construction of the adjacent reclamation, is discussed through a numerical procedure using the concept of mass permeability introduced to model the actual process of the dissipation of excess pore water pressure in the field. A modeling of the compressibility of the quasi-overconsolidated Pleistocene clay is also adopted to analyze the long-term settlement behavior. It is found that the present numerical analyses are capable of describing the large and long-term settlement together with the insufficient dissipation and propagation of excess pore water pressure due to the construction of the adjacent reclamation in the Pleistocene clay and sand gravel layers that has actually taken place in the field. The calculated performance is validated by comparing it with the measured results obtained for over 20 years from the start of the construction. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

However, pure loading is rarely encountered as combined loading occurs in many situations (offshore piles, pile driving as well as pile groups and pile rafts). In this study, the effects of nonlinear lateral pile vibrations on the in-phase nonlinear axial pile response of a pile shaft are studied. New approximate nonlinear solutions for both axial and lateral pile behavior, developed from general elastodynamic equations, are presented. The solutions are obtained by extending the elastodynamic solution for plane strain cases with a view to model soil nonlinearity. Since axial soil resistance depends on the confining stress around the pile shaft, the effect of the lateral soil behavior on the confining pressure of the pile circumference is investigated and the axial soil reaction from coupled in-phase vibrations is derived. It is concluded that the axial unit shear strength significantly increases when lateral soil vibrations involve plasticity, which in turn results in an increase in the axial dynamic resistance of the pile shaft. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Laboratory measurement of hydraulic conductivity functions of two unsaturated sandy soils during drying and wetting processes	2013	Soils and Foundations	53	3		417	430			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84882448609&partnerID=40&md5=ce2ed87c949be6cc08478c179c6816af	School of Earth Environmental and Biological Sciences, Science and Engineering Faculty, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD 4001, Australia; Department of Civil Engineering, University Monash, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia; Department of Civil Engineering, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan	Gallage, C., School of Earth Environmental and Biological Sciences, Science and Engineering Faculty, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD 4001, Australia; Kodikara, J., Department of Civil Engineering, University Monash, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia; Uchimura, T., Department of Civil Engineering, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan	The importance of applying unsaturated soil mechanics to geotechnical engineering design has been well understood. However, the consumption of time and the necessity for a specific laboratory testing apparatus when measuring unsaturated soil properties have limited the application of unsaturated soil mechanics theories in practice. Although methods for predicting unsaturated soil properties have been developed, the verification of these methods for a wide range of soil types is required in order to increase the confidence of practicing engineers in using these methods. In this study, a new permeameter was developed to measure the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils using the steady-state method and directly measured suction (negative pore-water pressure) values. The apparatus is instrumented with two tensiometers for the direct measurement of suction during the tests. The apparatus can be used to obtain the hydraulic conductivity function of sandy soil over a low suction range (0-10 kPa). Firstly, the repeatability of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity measurement, using the new permeameter, was verified by conducting tests on two identical sandy soil specimens and obtaining similar results. The hydraulic conductivity functions of the two sandy soils were then measured during the drying and wetting processes of the soils. A significant hysteresis was observed when the hydraulic conductivity was plotted against the suction. However, the hysteresis effects were not apparent when the conductivity was plotted against the volumetric water content. Furthermore, the measured unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions were compared with predictions using three different predictive methods that are widely incorporated into numerical software. The results suggest that these predictive methods are capable of capturing the measured behavior with reasonable agreement. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Toosi University of Technology, Valiasr St., Mirdamad Cr., Tehran, Iran	This paper describes laboratory tests on footing constructed on unreinforced and geogrid-reinforced sand with circular a void subjected to a combination of static and repeated loads. The settlement of the footing was measured for up to 5000 cycles of loading and unloading. The variables examined in the testing program include the number of geogrid layers, the location of the void within the soil, the amplitude of cyclic load, and the number of load cycles. The results show that the footing performance due to cyclic loading is better for thicker geogrid reinforced sand with a void than for unreinforced sand with no void. In addition, a critical region was found to exist under the footing, under which a void results in increased footing settlement. Overall, the results indicate that the reinforced soil-footing systems with sufficient geogrid-reinforcement and sufficient void embedment depth behave much more stiffly and are thus capable of handling greater loads with lower settlement than those in unreinforced soil without a void. The undesirable effect of the void on the footing behavior can be eliminated. In addition, the results show that the values of footing settlement increase rapidly during the initial loading cycles; thereafter the rate of settlement is reduced significantly as the number of loading cycles increases. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Gratchev I., Towhata I.	Stress-strain characteristics of two natural soils subjected to long-term acidic contamination	2013	Soils and Foundations	53	3		469	476			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84882448030&partnerID=40&md5=a9ec7b3b339702caa30cce7cee5d8ee8	Griffith School of Engineering, Centre for Infrastructure Engineering and Management, Griffith University, Australia; Department of Civil Engineering, University of Tokyo, Japan	Gratchev, I., Griffith School of Engineering, Centre for Infrastructure Engineering and Management, Griffith University, Australia; Towhata, I., Department of Civil Engineering, University of Tokyo, Japan	This paper seeks to investigate the effect of acidic contamination on the stress-strain characteristics of two natural soils with different mineral compositions: Kawasaki mud that contains montmorillonite and Yurakucho silt that has kaolinite as the dominant clay mineral. To reproduce the process of soil contamination in the laboratory, a special container was designed in which soil samples were leached with solutions of sulfuric acid for a period of almost 300 days. The laboratory investigation included a series of undrained triaxial compression tests on the leached samples. The obtained results indicate that the acidic contamination had a strong influence on the strength characteristics of the soils, and that the mineralogy of the clay fraction as well as the concentration of acid in the pore fluid significantly influenced the stress-strain behavior of the studied soils. It was found that for the Kawasaki mud, a decrease in pH from 7.3 to 6.0 led to an increase in soil strength. For the Yurakucho silt, a small decrease in pH (pH = 6.0) also brought about a slight increase in soil strength. However, a further decrease in pH (pH = 4.0) caused a significant reduction in the soil strength. An attempt was made to provide a rational explanation for the observed behavior of the soils based on the fundamentals of colloid chemistry and the available literature. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The analytical layer-element experiences considerable improvement in computation efficiency and stability, since it only contains negative exponential functions in its elements. In addition, a global stiffness matrix for multi-layered saturated poroelastic media is obtained by assembling the interrelated layer-elements based on the continuity conditions between adjacent layers. By introducing the boundary conditions and solving the global stiffness matrix, the solutions in the Laplace-Hankel transformed domain are obtained, and the final solutions can be recovered by a numerical inversion of the Laplace-Hankel transform. Finally, numerical examples are presented to verify the theory and to study the effect of the property of anisotropic permeability on vertical displacements and excess pore pressure. The calculation results show that the property of anisotropic permeability has a great influence on the process of consolidation. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The classical method of soil nail construction is, however, not effective in soft clay as it is difficult to establish a good bond strength and global soil improvement. An innovative soil nail installation method has been developed for the Airport link in Australia, which combines the applications of fracture grouting techniques and composite GFRP soil nails to stabilize the ground soil as well as to compensate for the settlement of ground. Extensive laboratory and in-situ tests have been carried out to verify the mass soil properties methods and the performance of the Geonail system for the local and global stabilization of the soft ground. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The main features of the behaviour of structured clays during and after sampling reported in the technical literature can be replicated. Notwithstanding the inevitable damage to the microstructure of the nominally undisturbed specimens, the reconsolidation procedures commonly applied in laboratory practice are confirmed to be beneficial, even where they are not conceptually justified, as is the case of the SHANSEP approach. While it is possible to determine the strength and compressibility of ideal specimens from numerical interpretation of laboratory tests on nominally undisturbed specimens, the problems related to their direct use in conventional simplified design approaches for stability and settlement predictions are highlighted. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

An experimental evaluation of the behavior of footings on geosynthetic-reinforced sand	2013	Soils and Foundations	53	2		335	348			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84882683281&partnerID=40&md5=9ae18b15d9276d5e6743e2a1473c7743	Louisiana Transportation Research Center, Louisiana State University, 4101 Gourrier Avenue, Baton Rouge, LA 70808, United States; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, West Virginia University, 625 Engineering Science Building, Morgantown, WV 26506, United States	Abu-Farsakh, M., Louisiana Transportation Research Center, Louisiana State University, 4101 Gourrier Avenue, Baton Rouge, LA 70808, United States; Chen, Q., Louisiana Transportation Research Center, Louisiana State University, 4101 Gourrier Avenue, Baton Rouge, LA 70808, United States; Sharma, R., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, West Virginia University, 625 Engineering Science Building, Morgantown, WV 26506, United States	This research was performed to investigate the behavior of geosynthetic-reinforced sandy soil foundations and to study the effect of different parameters contributing to their performance using laboratory model tests. The parameters investigated in this study included top layer spacing, number of reinforcement layers, vertical spacing between layers, tensile modulus and type of geosynthetic reinforcement, embedment depth, and shape of footing. The effect of geosynthetic reinforcement on the vertical stress distribution in the sand and the strain distribution along the reinforcement were also investigated. The test results demonstrated the potential benefit of using geosynthetic-reinforced sand foundations. The test results also showed that the reinforcement configuration/layout has a very significant effect on the behavior of reinforced sand foundation. With two or more layers of reinforcement, the settlement can be reduced by 20% at all footing pressure levels. Sand reinforced by the composite of geogrid and geotextile performed better than those reinforced by geogrid or geotextile alone. The inclusion of reinforcement can redistribute the applied footing load to a more uniform pattern, hence reducing the stress concentration, which will result reduced settlement. Finally, the results of model tests were compared with the analytical solution developed by the authors in previous studies; and the analytical solution gave a good predication of the experimental results of footing on geosynthetic reinforced sand. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

In the series of 37 tests, the ground was made by river sand whose particle size was adjusted by sieving to a mean particle size of 0.6 mm. The diameter of the model footing and the embedded depth were considered as influential parameters in this study. The diameter of the model footings varied from 5 to 40 mm and the ratio of the footing diameter to the mean particle size was calculated as 8.3-66.7. The ratio of the embedded depth to the footing diameter was 0, 0.5 and 1.0. As a result, the bearing capacity in the same equivalent diameter of footing was not dependent on the diameter of model footing when the ratio of footing diameter to particle size is more than 50 with any ratio of embedded depth to footing diameter. Our results that the proposed relationship between the ratio of footing diameter to the particle size and the ratio of the embedded depth to the footing diameter can be used to choose a reasonable model footing diameter, embedded depth and the particle size of ground material for centrifugal model tests. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Recent findings about the salient geophysics involved in intertidal sediments made it possible to closely investigate the linkage between the waterfront geoenvironment and the ecology of intertidal flats. The results of a comprehensive set of field observations, surveys and controlled laboratory experiments demonstrated that the waterfront suction, which remained thus far unexplored in soil mechanics, and the associated geoenvironments govern the performances of the basic living activities of various representative creatures involving crabs, bivalves and birds. Furthermore, these results are discussed and substantiated in light of a successful habitat restoration project showing that such waterfront geoenvironment plays a pivotal role in the habitat selection for the benthos diversity.

The analysis consists of defining assumptions regarding the spatial variations of the corrosion process throughout the wall, called corrosion scenarios, that define the evolution of the stiffness and strength of the steel strips. This evolution is introduced into finite element simulations of the behavior of a typical wall, in which interactions between the backfill and the strips are considered using a generalized homogenization procedure (called a multiphase model). The results of the simulations are used to discuss the influence of the heterogeneity of the corrosion process on the overall time evolution of the wall. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Triaxial compression tests on a partially saturated dense Toyoura sand specimen were carried out under a low confining pressure and under drained conditions for both air and water. The development of localized deformation was observed macroscopically using microfocus X-ray CT, and the displacement field over the entire specimen was quantified by an image analysis of the CT images with the digital image correlation (DIC) technique. The progressive development of shear bands is discussed with reference to these images. In addition, the region of localization was observed microscopically by partial CT scanning on a micron scale with high spatial resolution. Changes in the particulate structures are also discussed herein. The DIC image analysis of the partial CT images provided a microscopic displacement field and indicated that very fine localized shear deformation developed before the shear bands had become visible in the macroscopic investigation. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Experimental studies have indicated that the lateral resistance of the pile under multidirectional paths is generally lower than that under a unidirectional path and the degree of reduction depends on the characteristics of the loading paths. On the other hand, most currently used p-y models can take the soil-pile interaction under unidirectional lateral loading into account, but it cannot be applied directly to analyze the response of piles under multidirectional lateral loading. A multidirectional p-y model is proposed in this study, which is formulated within the framework of the bounding-surface elastoplastic theory and consists of two loading mechanisms: the parallel loading and the orthogonal loading. The model has five parameters, which are readily available or calibrated. To demonstrate its ability to model soil-pile interactions under both unidirectional and multidirectional lateral loadings, the proposed model is incorporated into a finite-element program to analyze laterally loaded piles. The responses of piles with different embedment lengths subject to various loading paths are investigated. The non-coaxial relationship between the force increment and the displacement increment vectors at the pile head under the multidirectional loading, and the impact of the multidirectional loading on the lateral resistance are well captured in the analyses. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

A good understanding of their hydro-mechanical behaviour is essential to ensure disposal safety. In this study, a mixture of MX80 bentonite and sand was characterised in the laboratory in terms of water retention property, swelling pressure, compressibility and hydraulic conductivity. The effects of the technological voids or the voids inside the soil were investigated. The technological voids are referred to as the macro-pores related to different interfaces involving the buffer material, whereas the voids inside the soil are referred to as common macro-pores within the compacted bentonite/sand mixture. The results obtained show that at high suction, the amount of water absorbed in the soil depends solely on suction, whereas at low suction it depends on both suction and the bentonite void ratio. There is a unique relationship between the swelling pressure and the bentonite void ratio, regardless of the sample nature (homogeneous or not) and the sand fraction. However, at the same bentonite void ratio, a higher hydraulic conductivity was obtained on the samples with technological voids. The effect of sand fraction was evidenced in the mechanical yield behaviour: at the same bentonite void ratio, the bentonite-sand mixture yielded at a higher pre-consolidation stress. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Vichan S., Rachan R.	Chemical stabilization of soft Bangkok clay using the blend of calcium carbide residue and biomass ash	2013	Soils and Foundations	53	2		272	281			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84882725998&partnerID=40&md5=3595b25bc01cf9c578025522dcfaeb7b	Department of Civil Engineering, Mahanakorn University of Technology, 140 Cheumsampam, Bangkok 10530, Thailand	Vichan, S., Department of Civil Engineering, Mahanakorn University of Technology, 140 Cheumsampam, Bangkok 10530, Thailand; Rachan, R., Department of Civil Engineering, Mahanakorn University of Technology, 140 Cheumsampam, Bangkok 10530, Thailand	The blend of calcium carbide residue (CCR) and biomass ash (BA) required as a stabilizing chemical additive which causes a pozzolanic reaction was investigated. The dissolution of CCR in water generated calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2. This high pH solution (pH = 12.6) dissolved the amorphous Si from BA and resulted in pozzolanic products. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses indicated the existence of ettringite and non crystalline phase calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) after 7 days of curing. The strength development of stabilized clay with a CCR and BA blend is influenced by the interrelationship of various factors, including the binder content, the water content and curing time. From two factorial experiments, the strength of stabilized clay at specific curing time and initial water content was the function of the CCR content, the BA content and their combined effect. When the initial soil water content was constant at 1.2 and 1.4 times the optimum water content (OWC) and the binder contents ranged from 5% to 30% of the dry weight of soil, the strength depended on the clay water-binder ratio (wc/B) and the curing time. The plot of the strength development ratio and curing time on a logarithmic scale revealed that the blend of CCR and BA rendered a different chemical reaction from cemented clay and fly ash (FA) and BA blended cement admixed clay. The strength development ratio of stabilized clay with a CCR and BA mixture exceeded those of cemented clay and FA and BA blended cement admixed clay after 28 days of curing due to the progress of the pozzolanic reaction. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

It was found that the strength of MH sand increased with MH saturation due to particle bonding. Dissociation by heating caused large axial strains for samples with an initial shear stress and total collapse for samples consolidated in the metastable zone. In the case of dissociation by de-pressurization, axial strains were generated by increasing effective stress until a stable equilibrium was reached. However, re-pressurization led to the collapse in the metastable zone. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on an extensive literature review covering both element testing and model testing, the paper summarizes the current understanding of the loading rate effects. The paper then describes the development of test apparatus used in this study and presents the data obtained from a series of monotonically increasing triaxial compression tests on Toyoura sand, varying the strain rate in the range of 0.005%/s to 250%/s. A total of 36 tests were conducted on dry and saturated sand, both under drained and undrained conditions with two confining pressures. The experimental results confirm that the soil strength and the soil stiffness increase as the strain rate increase. This paper also concludes that the internal friction angle and deformation modulus increase when the strain rate is high.

Shrinkage and desaturation properties during desiccation of reconstituted cohesive soil	2013	Soils and Foundations	53	1		49	63			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84876676990&partnerID=40&md5=65423f2e3e447496e22fc116b3598962	Department of Civil Engineering, Shinshu University, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano City, Japan	Umezakin, T., Department of Civil Engineering, Shinshu University, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano City, Japan; Kawamura, T., Department of Civil Engineering, Shinshu University, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano City, Japan	A vacuum evaporation method, proposed by the authors to reduce the water content more quickly than by air drying, was applied to six saturated reconstituted cohesive soil samples to investigate shrinkage and desaturation properties during desiccation. The test conditions were a vacuum pressure of pv = -93.9 to -97.5 kPa, a consolidation pressure of σv = 68.6-392 kPa, an initial water content of w0 = 0.59-0.92 wL, and an initial surface area of the specimen of A s0 = 20-205 cm2, where wL is the liquid limit. The results obtained for these restricted conditions are as follows. The vacuum evaporation of pore water from the soil occurs at a vacuum pressure higher than about -93 kPa (|pv|&gt;93 kPa), but the evaporation process is very slow. The minimum void ratio, emin, at the no-shrinkage phase of the soil subjected to the vacuum pressure, becomes a constant value. The relations emin ≈ 1.15 es and ws ≈ 87(e min/Gs) are obtained, where es is the void ratio corresponding to the shrinkage limit, ws, and Gs is the specific gravity of the soil particles. Using the vacuum evaporation method, the continuous relations for w-e, w-V/V0, and w-Sr are more easily and more rapidly obtainable than with the conventional method by air drying. These three relations were formulated using two parameters, namely, an experimental parameter that is simply obtained using vacuum evaporation tests and a parameter that can be assumed and determined easily. The three formulated relations show a good agreement with the experimentally obtained results. Furthermore, if the basic physical parameter, ws, has already been obtained, then the three relations can be estimated roughly without the performance of any tests. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Piles in level ground and piles placed at a distance from the crest of a slope were examined, taking account of the effect of the adhesion at the pile-soil interface. The derived analytical solutions were used to develop charts relating the lateral pile capacity to the pile length/diameter ratio, the pile-soil adhesion, the distance of the point of load application from the ground to the pile diameter ratio, the inclination of the slope and the distance of the pile from the crest of the slope to the pile diameter ratio. They were also used to derive a reduction factor which, when multiplied by the lateral bearing capacity for level ground, gives the bearing capacity of the same pile near a slope. In addition, a critical non-dimensional distance between the pile and the crest of the slope, at which the bearing capacity approaches that for a level ground, was determined. The bearing capacity charts obtained for level ground were compared to the classic Broms' charts and to others derived using several different lateral earth pressure distributions along the pile. Comparisons were also made between the results of the proposed method for piles near slopes and those obtained from charts based on upper bound calculations. Finally, the proposed new method was validated through a comparison with the results of a large number of pile load tests, in which a remarkable agreement was observed between the analytical results and the measurements. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The ultimate load of the slope decreased significantly with the increasing gradient of the slope or the decreasing nail length. The slope exhibited significant progressive failure that was captured by a displacement-based analysis. At first, the vertical load caused local slippage near the slope toe and the inner edge of the loading plate. Then, it extended to the interior of the slope and eventually to an entire slip surface. The H-surface was obtained according to the measured displacement to distinguish the zone where the surface load influenced the horizontal displacement of the slope. The H-surface and the position where the peak vertical displacement occurred in a horizontal line moved from the internal slope to the slope surface from the slope top to the slope bottom. This demonstrates the dispersion of the surface load application within the slope. The deflections of nails can be obtained from the corresponding soil deformation. The deflection of nails increased with the increasing load pressure, and exhibited diverse features in its distribution in the upper and the lower parts of the slope. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Even though most stability methods are based on force and moment equilibrium, as well as the Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion, there are great differences between the results of the different formulations due to variations in the assumptions. The authors believe that the use of the interslice force function f(x), the thrust line or the base normal forces should provide an equivalent concept at the ultimate/failure state. In the present study, the authors have used the well-known bearing capacity solutions to determine f(x), the thrust line and the base normal forces for a horizontal slope. The equivalence between the different formulations under the ultimate condition is demonstrated. It is shown that it is not important which forces are used in the stability formulation, external boundary forces or internal forces, if only that the ultimate state is considered. It is also demonstrated in the present paper that the maximum extremum from the limit equilibrium analysis is equivalent to the slip line solution using a classical bearing capacity problem. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The role of particle breakage in the mechanics of a non-plastic silty sand	2013	Soils and Foundations	53	1		91	104			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84876673760&partnerID=40&md5=21e36a3677d4db596bef75b613c682f5	Institute for Mining, Geotechnology and Environment (IRGO), Ljubljana, Slovenia; Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Institute for Mining, Geotechnology and Environment (IRGO), Sloven?eva 93, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; Formerly Slovenian National Building and Civil Engineering Institute, ZAG, Ljubljana, Slovenia; Formerly Imperial College, London, United Kingdom	Vilhar, G., Institute for Mining, Geotechnology and Environment (IRGO), Ljubljana, Slovenia, Institute for Mining, Geotechnology and Environment (IRGO), Sloven?eva 93, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia, Formerly Slovenian National Building and Civil Engineering Institute, ZAG, Ljubljana, Slovenia; Jovi?ić, V., Institute for Mining, Geotechnology and Environment (IRGO), Ljubljana, Slovenia; Coop, M.R., Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Formerly Imperial College, London, United Kingdom	A detailed investigation was carried out on a silty sand from Boštanj, Slovenia, in order to identify the role that particle breakage plays in test interpretations and mechanics. The soil was tested up to a high pressure in the triaxial and oedometer apparatus. Unexpected for a silty sand, the basic patterns of behaviour, in terms of strength and stiffness, were found to be similar to those of many previously investigated clean sands, with unique and parallel Normal Compression and Critical State Lines at higher stress levels and a horizontal asymptote to the Critical State Line at lower stress levels. The stiffness was controlled primarily by the state of the soil relative to the location of these lines. Despite the better grading, there was still very significant particle breakage. However, the breakage was largely confined to the coarse fraction. The grading curves after various tests all showed convergence with the initial grading towards 1 μm, which may therefore represent the comminution limit. It is believed that it is the particle breakage that caused the behaviour to follow a simple Critical State type of framework and why transitional or non-convergent compression behaviour was not found. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The evaluation has been performed by a lower bound finite element limit analysis in combination with a linear optimization. Two φ-σm curves, available from literature, were used. The magnitude of Nγ has been computed for several footing diameters, covering almost the entire possible range of model and field footing sizes. Factor Nγ is seen to decrease significantly with an increase in B. For B approximately greater than (i) 0.7 m for smooth footings (δ = 0) and (ii) 0.35 m for rough footings (δ = φ), N γ varies almost linearly with B on a log-log scale. Once a relationship has been generated between Ng and B, for a given design load, the required footing diameter can always be obtained. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

All test data were collated from the Bureau of Rural Road 6, the Department of Rural Roads, Thailand. The Ohio's and the modified Ohio's curves can predict satisfactorily the compaction curves of the fine-grained soils, and lateritic soils and crushed rocks consistent with the grade B of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) requirement. The CBR value of a specific soil is directly related to the relative dry unit weight (the ratio of dry unit weight to maximum dry unit weight, γd/ γd,max). The field compaction result of a fine-grained soil at the optimum water content, OWC, shows that initially the dry unit weight increases rapidly with the number of roller passes and the relationship between dry unit weight and number of roller passes is represented by the logarithm function. Finally, the dry unit weight reaches a constant value, which is close to the laboratory maximum dry unit weight. Even with a large number of roller passes (compaction energy), the dry unit weight cannot be enhanced further because the soil state approaches the zero air void state. In practice, the excess roller pass is thus not economic. Based on the analysis of the test data, the field compaction procedure for road embankment and pavement constructions, which includes the material selection and the construction control, is suggested. It is useful in terms of both engineering and economic viewpoints. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Flow box test for viscosity of soil in plastic and viscous liquid states	2013	Soils and Foundations	53	1		35	46			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84876674899&partnerID=40&md5=0efe21f9b07e02e414c904bf00f9ade7	Department of Construction Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, No. 43 Keelung Road, Section 4, Taipei 106, Taiwan	Widjaja, B., Department of Construction Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, No. 43 Keelung Road, Section 4, Taipei 106, Taiwan; Lee, S.H.-H., Department of Construction Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, No. 43 Keelung Road, Section 4, Taipei 106, Taiwan	The transformation of soil from a plastic state to a viscous liquid state is primarily caused by a change in the water content of the soil mass. As the water content increases, the soil mass gradually starts to behave like a viscous liquid. In spite of viscosity being a key parameter to the initiation of mudflows, there have only been a few datasets on soil viscosity changes successfully measured continuously as the soil moves from a plastic state to a viscous liquid state. The aim of the current research is to design a new device to overcome this problem. Based on the trap door principle, formulated by Terzaghi (1943) and the Bingham model, a new device called the flow box was designed. The governing equation of the flow box was derived in this research in order to obtain the relationship between the initial viscosity and the liquidity index. In this study, the viscosities in both plastic and viscous liquid states were clearly defined by the flow box test. The expected decrease in initial viscosity was followed by an increase in the liquidity index, which corroborated with the test results. The initial viscosity readings were also validated with the results of other similar researches and the case study of the Maokong mudflow. Hence, the purpose of this research is to create a new device to successfully determine the viscosity levels as soil changes from the plastic state to the liquid state. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Measurement errors and bias that often occur during soil investigations are now incorporated into the probabilistic model of soil properties in addition to the spatial variability and the effects of spatial averaging. The results of the analysis show that the unconditional approach, which considers spatial variability, but does not account for measurement-related uncertainties, can yield unconservative results because of an unrealistically large variance reduction. In contrast, the results obtained from the unconditional approach, which does consider spatial variability and measurement-related uncertainties, as well as those from the conditional approach, lead to significantly lower probabilities of failure that are much less sensitive to the scales of fluctuation. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

While efforts have been made in terms of measuring the shear band properties and the stress-strain behavior within shear bands, there are still uncertainties regarding when shear bands initiate and their influence on the development of large ground deformation. In this paper, the limiting value of shear strain, at which strain localization appears during undrained cyclic torsional shear tests with initial static shear, performed on loose Toyoura sand specimens (Dr = 44-48%) up to a single amplitude of shear strain exceeding 50%, was evaluated. Non-uniform specimen deformation was observed at strain levels larger than 20%. However, the onset of strain localization could not be defined on the basis of visual observations. Therefore, the limiting values for half of the double amplitude (γDA/2) and single amplitude (γSA) shear strain, to initiate strain localization, were determined from test results based on changes in the deviator stress response and strain accumulation properties as well as changes in the strain-softening behavior during cyclic shear. It was found that γSA is a more appropriate parameter than γDA/2. Irrespective of the static shear stress level, the limiting strain value for γSA was evaluated to be in the range of 23-28% for liquefied loose Toyoura sand specimens (i.e., stress reversal and intermediate tests).

It has been reported that the major cause of earthquake damage to embankments on level ground surfaces is liquefaction of foundation soil. A few case histories, however, suggest that river levees resting on non-liquefiable foundation soil have been severely damaged if the foundation soil is highly compressible, such as thick soft clay and peat deposits. A large number of such river levees were severely damaged by the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku earthquake. A detailed inspection of the dissected damaged levees revealed that the base of the levees subsided in a bowl shape due to foundation consolidation. The liquefaction of a saturated zone, formed at the embankment base, is considered the prime cause of the damage. The deformation of the levees, due to the foundation consolidation which may have resulted in a reduction in stress and the degradation of soil density, is surmised to have contributed as an underlying mechanism. In this study, a series of centrifuge tests is conducted to experimentally verify the effects of the thickness of the saturated zone in embankments and of the foundation consolidation on the seismic damage to embankments. It is found that the thickness of the saturated zone in embankments and the drainage boundary conditions of the zone have a significant effect on the deformation of the embankments during shaking. For an embankment on a soft clay deposit, horizontal tensile strain as high as 6% was observed at the zone above the embankment base and horizontal stress was approximately half that of the embankment on stiff foundation soil. Crest settlement and the deformation of the embankment during shaking were larger for the embankment subjected to deformation due to foundation consolidation. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The frozen sampling (FS) method is useful for dynamic strength and deformation tests of undisturbed clean sand. However, it is very expensive and requires considerable equipment. The sample quality of Toyoura sands obtained from 48 mm and 75 mm samplers are scrutinized based on void ratio, dynamic strength and deformation properties through model and cyclic undrained triaxial tests. A conventional method for estimating in-situ dynamic strength and deformation properties of sand samples utilizing density changes is examined and the applicability of the proposed method is discussed for the samples obtained from Niigata sand deposits. The main conclusions obtained from this study are summarized as follows: (1) A conventional method for estimating in-situ void ratio (e0), Dr, stress ratio (RL20) in a 20 cyclic time frame and the initial modulus of rigidity (G0) of sand samples utilizing density changes is proposed. (2) The in-situ RL20 and G0 estimated from the proposed method for sand samples from tube samplers were similar to those of frozen sampling and the in-situ modulus of initial rigidity was calculated from the secondary wave velocity for Niigata sand deposits. Therefore, dynamic strength and deformation properties changes, caused by sampling, can be modified appropriately to an in-situ condition by this proposed method. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

This principle could be used to interpret the behavior of mudflows, the most dangerous mass movements today. When Typhoon Jangmi hit northern Taiwan in 2008, a mudflow occurred in the Maokong area as a result of the high-intensity rainfall. This case was studied using three simulations, each with a different water content. Based on the mudflow classifications, the primary criteria used in this study were flow velocity and solid concentration by volume, while the major rheology parameters directly obtained from our new laboratory device, the flow box test, were yield stress and viscosity. The results show that the mass movement confirmed the aforementioned criteria for mudflow when the water content reaches or exceeds the liquid limit. The flow box test can determine the viscosity for both plastic and viscous liquid states, which is advantageous. Viscosity is important for explaining the general characteristics of mudflow movement because it controls flow velocity. Therefore, the present study successfully elucidates the changes in mudflow from its initiation to its transportation and deposition via a numerical simulation using laboratory rheology parameters. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Although it is generally known that a natural rock fracture indicates a complex aperture distribution, the fracture is often ideally represented by a parallel plate model. The cubic law is applied to evaluate the hydraulic properties of fractured rock. From several previous research works, it is understood that the cubic law can be applied when the Reynolds number is less than 1.0 and that the inertia term can basically be ignored in such slow fracture flows. In this research work, two-dimensional seepage flow analyses, using the authors' proposed 2D model, in which the inertia term, the pressure term and the diffusion term are incorporated, are carried out for single fracture permeability tests under conditions which allow for the application of the cubic law. In comparing the results of the experiments with the results of the numerical simulation, the results of the simulation employing the 2D model show a good agreement with the experimental results; the 2D model can simulate the water flow in an inhomogeneous fracture more accurately than the simulation based on the local cubic law. From these simulation results, the fracture flow in an inhomogeneous structure is discussed, along with the local Reynolds number, and the resistance through the fracture geometry is considered. Consequently, under the condition of a mean Reynolds number of less than 1.0, the inertia terms do not affect the fracture flow, but the hydraulic resistance does affect the fracture flow. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Specifically, this study focuses on an investigation of the effects of the moisture conditions on the strength performance and durability of very soft clay soil stabilized with Bassanite and furnace cement mixtures during the wetting-drying cycles, referred to as weathering conditions in this study. Cylindrical stabilized soil specimens were produced and then cured for 28 days. The cured specimens were subjected to different numbers of wetting-drying cycles, and then tested for unconfined compressive strength. The results show that the compressive strength increased with an increase in the Bassanite content for the different wetting-drying cycles investigated. The increase in the Bassanite content is associated with the increase in the dry unit weight, as well as in the decrease in the moisture content of the stabilized specimens for the different wetting-drying cycles investigated. The compressive strength of the soil stabilized with the Bassanite and furnace cement mixtures gradually decreases with an increase in the number of wetting-drying cycles, and the earlier cycles are seen to have a more negative effect on durability than the later cycles. Generally, the influence of the wetting-drying cycles on changes in the strength, durability and volume of the soft clay soil stabilized with Bassanite and furnace cement mixtures is not significant. This is evidence that the use of recycled Bassanite, produced from gypsum waste to stabilize soft clay soil, achieves acceptable durability, raises the strength performance and improves the engineering properties of soft clay soil in a wet environment. In addition, the effective use of gypsum waste contributes to the development of a sustainable society by reducing the huge quantity of solid waste and establishing a sound environment. © 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Improvement and extension of the parallel seismic method for foundation depth measurement	2012	Soils and Foundations	52	6		1093	1101			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84876667703&partnerID=40&md5=ebd0c9c2d07e4c996ba340e1402ea91a	BAM Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing, Division 8.2 Nondestructive Damage Assessment and Environmental Measurement Methods, Germany	Niederleithinger, E., BAM Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing, Division 8.2 Nondestructive Damage Assessment and Environmental Measurement Methods, Germany	The parallel seismic (PS) method is used for determination of the unknown or undocumented depth of foundations, mostly piles. It was developed several decades ago and has not much changed since. PS is based on impulse generation on the pile head and registration of travel times in a borehole parallel to the foundation. The method is applicable to many foundation types, including single piles, pile walls, or sheet piles. While the accuracy is known to be high if the distance between foundation and borehole is small, the foundation length is overestimated with increasing distance. This paper presents the results of a systematic study on the influence of geometric and material parameters on the measurement results and explains the effects by studying the underlying wave phenomena based on numerical studies. It can be shown that several parameters (e.g. borehole inclination) have a strong influence. Foundation flaws and soil layers have also to be taken into account, while the possibilities in the other direction (derivation of soil parameters or detection of flaws from the results) are limited. Based on the simulation results, a new mathematical algorithm for data interpretation has been developed which takes into account the soil layers and the borehole inclination. This novel data interpretation scheme was used in combination with different data inversion methods. The new interpretation method was successfully validated using several sets of simulated data. Not only was it shown to be more accurate than all other available methods, but it also extended the maximum allowable pile-borehole distance to 2-3 m. Today, parallel seismics is the only method applicable on both metallic and non-metallic foundations which can be used without calibration. It has the largest range of all borehole methods. To enhance its efficiency it can be combined with downhole seismic measurements in the very same borehole to retrieve soil parameters. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

We studied the influence of pore water pressure during rapid load tests and its effect on the widely used unloading point method to derive static pile capacity. This paper describes the testing programme and the test set-up. We present typical measurement results from a total of 36 rapid and 12 static load tests, as well as the effects of the loading rate and excess pore pressures on pile resistance. The tests confirm that a rapid load test can overestimate static capacity due to pore water pressure when testing piles in medium to fine sands. The results of the pore pressure measurements show a combination of positive and negative excess pore pressure in the zone around the pile base, which can be explained by compression, volumetric behaviour during shearing and pore fluid flow around the pile. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

A model test on a full system with a superstructure, a nine-pile foundation and a sandy ground was conducted with the shaking table test device. The model pile is made from aluminum and the model ground is made from Toyoura Sand. The shaking table test device is 120 cm in width and 160 cm in length. The maximum acceleration is 1 g and the maximum displacement is 5 cm. The maximum payload is 16 kN and the highest frequency is 10 Hz. The model ground is carefully prepared to obtain a ground with controllable unified density. Before the shaking table test, the pattern of the partial ground improvement for an existed group-pile foundation is carefully selected using numerical tests with a 3D elastoplastic static finite element analysis. In the analysis, the nonlinear behavior of ground and piles are described by the cyclic mobility model (Zhang et al., 2007) and the axial force dependent model (AFD model) proposed by Zhang and Kimura (2002) can take into consideration of axial-force dependency in the nonlinear moment-curvature relations. The applicability of the numerical analysis has been verified in previous works by comparing the numerical results with a real-scale field tests (Kosa et al., 1998). Based on the results from the numerical tests on seismic enhancement effect of group-pile foundation with ground improvement, an optimum pattern of partial ground improvement of an existing pile foundations has been picked out for shaking table test. A numerical analysis using the program DBLEAVES (Ye, 2007) is also conducted for the same optimum pattern for comparison purposes. The effectiveness of the partial ground improvement method has been proved by both the shaking table test and the numerical analysis. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Comparison of rapid load pile testing of driven and CFA piles installed in high OCR clay	2012	Soils and Foundations	52	6		1033	1042			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84876671718&partnerID=40&md5=650e25692a0e0f0d0179b5fc626e9b90	Civil Engineering, University of Dundee, United Kingdom; Geolabs Limited, United Kingdom; Building Technology Group, Building Research Establishment, United Kingdom	Brown, M.J., Civil Engineering, University of Dundee, United Kingdom; Powell, J.J.M., Geolabs Limited, United Kingdom, Building Technology Group, Building Research Establishment, United Kingdom	The current analysis of rapid load tests (RLT) such as Statnamic is normally based upon empirical correlations with static pile tests in similar soils. In certain soil types, such as clays, the number of case studies used to develop analysis and allow selection of appropriate rate effect correction are limited. Due to these limitations, no distinction is made in the selection of correction factors between pile type and pile installation techniques. In clay soils it is well known that driven piles may have a significantly enhanced capacity over cast in situ piles of similar cross-section. To test the effect of pile installation techniques on RLT analysis, RLT testing and static testing were undertaken on precast driven concrete piles and cast in situ CFA piles installed in high plasticity London Clay. The results show that the installation technique does not appear to affect the magnitude of the rate effects, provided modifications are made to the analysis to account for the previously reported differences in static capacity between different installation techniques. Based upon the findings, it is suggested that a distinction should be made in RLT analysis between pile type and installation techniques, and for existing analysis techniques, further case studies based on rate correction parameters are required, especially in clay soils. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The results suggest the following conclusions: (1) Existing piles increased the total shaft resistance of the new pile with a rough surface because the existing piles restrained the soil around the new pile and the positive dilatancy of the sand increased the confining pressure of the soil. (2) The shaft resistance of the lower part of the new pile with a rough surface fell rapidly during the loading tests, regardless of whether there were existing piles or not. The diminution of shaft resistance, known as 'friction fatigue', was probably caused by sand particle crushing in the vicinity of the pile end. (3) For a new pile with a rough surface, existing piles did not affect the end resistance when the new pile head settlement normalized by the pile diameter, s/Dp, was less than 0.2. (4) Existing piles did not affect the shaft resistance or the end resistance of the new pile with a smooth surface.

Sensitivity analysis of vertically loaded pile reliability	2012	Soils and Foundations	52	6		1118	1129			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84876664678&partnerID=40&md5=8a7bdb43a3d904eab449f023c716ce04	C-TAC, School of Engineering, University of Minho, Guimaráaes, Portugal; Department of Civil Engineering, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan; LABEST, Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal	Teixeira, A., C-TAC, School of Engineering, University of Minho, Guimaráaes, Portugal; Honjo, Y., Department of Civil Engineering, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan; Gomes Correia, A., C-TAC, School of Engineering, University of Minho, Guimaráaes, Portugal; Abel Henriques, A., LABEST, Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal	The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of geotechnical uncertainties on the reliability of vertically loaded pile foundations and the use of this information in decision-making support, especially when gathering the information necessary for reliability analyses. Two case studies of single pile foundations were selected, and each uncertainty source was investigated to identify which are the most important and influential in the evaluation of vertical pile resistance under axial loading. Reliability sensitivity analyses were conducted using FORM (the first-order reliability method) and MCS (Monte Carlo simulations). The characterisation of uncertainties is not an easy task in geotechnical engineering. The aim of the analyses described in this paper is to optimise resources and investments in the investigation of the variables in pile reliability. The physical uncertainties of actions, the inherent variability of soil and model error were assessed by experimental in situ standard penetration tests (SPT) or from information available in the literature. For the cases studied, the sensitivity analysis results show that, in spite of the high variability of the soils involved, model error also plays a very important role in geotechnical pile reliability and was considerably more important than soil variability in both case studies. From a comparison of the two reliability methods (FORM and MCS), it was concluded that FORM is applicable in simple cases and as a first approach because it is an approximate method and sometimes does not have the capability to incorporate every detail of the problem, namely a specific probability density function or more specific limit conditions. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

One of the most outstanding characteristics of the new runway is that it stands on two types of different structures: steel-jacket-platforms forming a pier-type structure and a reclaimed soil structure. The pier-type structure minimizes disturbance of water flow at the nearby Tama river mouth due to the presence of the new runway. This paper relates to the design and construction of the steel-jacket platforms for the pier structure. The main focus is on the results of pile load tests carried out to confirm the pile design, and the actual construction of the jacket structures. Through the construction of this pier-type structure, it has been possible to confirm the applicability of rapid load tests for large-diameter long steel pipe piles, the validity of the assumed pile tip plugging ratio used for design, and the applicability of a simple method for controlling the end of pile driving. Further, the effectiveness of joint-less work piles, the pile-keeper system, and GPS monitoring in the rapid and accurate construction of pier-type jacket structures was demonstrated. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Extensive damage was caused by the effect of soil liquefaction to residential lands and houses, as well as to infrastructures, such as roads, rivers, ports, and water supply/sewage systems. Since the 2011 off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake occurred in a megasize fault zone, with an area of 500 km × 200 km, the duration of the strong shaking was extremely long compared to that in the data recorded for past earthquakes. Clarifying the effect of the characteristics of the ground motion on the soil liquefaction mechanism is one of the essential studies to be conducted, and effective countermeasures for the damaged structures need to be found. This paper presents the strong motion observation data obtained on the liquefied and the non-liquefied grounds and raises preliminary discussions on the mechanism of soil liquefaction based on this data. The effect of the duration and the number of cyclic loadings on the progress of the soil liquefaction phenomenon is also compared with that found in past strong motion data. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.	2011 off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku earthquake; Cyclic loading; Duration time; Ground motion; Pore water pressure; Soil liquefaction; Strong motion observation	2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku earthquakes; Duration time; Ground motions; Pore-water pressures; Strong motion; Cyclic loads; Soil liquefaction; Earthquakes						Azuma, T., Tamura, K., Evaluation method of soil resistance against liquefaction considering cyclic loading effect of earthquake ground motions (1997) Civil Engineering Journal, 39 (9), pp. 50-55; Creager, W.P., Justin, J.D., Hinds, J., Engineering for dams (1945) Earth, Rock-fill, Steel and Timber Dams, 3, pp. 648-649. , Wiley, New York; (1996) Part V.

Seismic behavior of piled raft with ground improvement supporting a base-isolated building on soft ground in Tokyo	2012	Soils and Foundations	52	5		1000	1015		1	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84876667145&partnerID=40&md5=146090b15d17fcdd7dc1bfe5bf63ea45	Research and Development Institute, Takenaka Corporation, Japan; Building Design Department, Osaka Main Office, Takenaka Corporation, Japan	Yamashita, K., Research and Development Institute, Takenaka Corporation, Japan; Hamada, J., Research and Development Institute, Takenaka Corporation, Japan; Onimaru, S., Building Design Department, Osaka Main Office, Takenaka Corporation, Japan; Higashino, M., Research and Development Institute, Takenaka Corporation, Japan	The static and seismic behavior of a piled raft foundation, supporting a 12-story base-isolated building in Tokyo, is investigated by monitoring the soil-foundation-structure system. Since the building is located on loose silty sand, underlain by soft cohesive soil, a piled raft with grid-form deep cement mixing walls was employed to cope with the liquefiable sand as well as to improve the bearing capacity of the raft foundation. To confirm the validity of the foundation design, field measurements were carried out on the ground settlements, the pile loads, the contact pressure and the pore-water pressure beneath the raft from the beginning of the construction to 43 months after the end of the construction. On March 11, 2011, 30 months after the end of the construction, the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake struck the building site. The seismic response of the ground and the foundation-structure system was successfully recorded during the earthquake, and a peak horizontal ground acceleration of 1.75 m/s2 was observed at the site of the building. Based on static and dynamic measurement results, it was found that there was little change in the foundation settlement and the load sharing between the raft and the piles before and after the earthquake. It was also found that the horizontal accelerations of the superstructure were reduced to approximately 30% of those of the ground near the ground surface by the input losses due to the kinematic soil-foundation interaction in addition to the base isolation system. Consequently, the piled raft with grid-form deep cement mixing walls was found to be quite stable in the soft ground during and after the earthquake. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Liquefaction in Tohoku district during the 2011 off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake	2012	Soils and Foundations	52	5		811	829			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84876693910&partnerID=40&md5=60f13fb351168139c6844f8f979cf80b		Yamaguchi, A.; Mori, T.; Kazama, M.; Yoshida, N.	Information on the liquefaction and the liquefaction-induced damage in the Tohoku district during the 2011 off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake has been compiled. The liquefaction in this report was mainly identified by sand boils. It caused damage to earth structures and residential houses, as well as the uplift of manholes. A comparison of geological maps and aerial photos, before and after the earthquake, shows that many of the liquefied sites were old river beds and developed areas. Liquefaction in the tsunami-affected areas was difficult to identify as the evidence of liquefaction had been washed away by the tsunami. However, the liquefaction was identified through interviews with residents and by photos and videos taken before the arrival of the tsunami. Liquefaction was also observed at Sendai Airport, but the runaway was not damaged because it had been remediated against soil liquefaction. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

As a result of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami, approximately 23,000 Gg (23,000,000 t) of disaster debris was generated, with more than 12 million m3 of tsunami deposits left in the flooded area. The geotechnical utilization of the soil fraction in the disaster debris and tsunami deposits has presented a huge challenge to geotechnical engineers since (1) the clearance of debris and tsunami deposits is an urgent task which must be completed within a few years and (2) although a large amount of waste-mixed soil can be used in the construction of new embankments and levees to protect the coast from future tsunamis, their geotechnical properties have temporal and spatial variations. This paper summarizes the current status on the generation, clearance, and treatment and utilization of disaster debris and tsunami deposits from geotechnical and geo-environmental viewpoints. In addition, the environmental monitoring data on soil and groundwater quality conducted over the affected area is briefly reviewed. The results of several wide-area monitoring efforts conducted by different organizations indicate that no significant soil or groundwater contamination has occurred. However, the localized contamination near industrial plants where toxic chemicals leaked due to the earthquake and tsunami needs to be carefully taken into consideration during future revival and redevelopment works. Another serious geo-environmental issue is the management of the radioactive contamination of surface soils caused by the accident at the Fukushima First Nuclear Power Plant. This paper summarizes the distributions and expected behaviours of radioactive Caesium in soils and groundwater, and outlines the possible remediation options for dealing with this contamination. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Damage was identified at more than 10% of the inspected dams, with embankment dams showing a slightly higher ratio. Damage to embankment dams included relatively wide and/or long cracks mainly on the crest of earthfill dams, cracks in the impervious membrane of asphalt faced rockfill dams (AFRDs) and temporary increase in leakage. However, none of the dams under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) sustained damage severe enough to threaten the safety of the dam, although an old earthfill embankment dam for an irrigation pond located outside the area regulated by the River Law was breached due to the earthquake. In this paper, the results of special safety inspections are summarized, as well as those of subsequent detailed investigations of several embankment dams under the jurisdiction of MILT. The features of the earthquake motions observed at the dam foundations during the earthquake and their effects on the behavior of embankment dams are also discussed. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

In the present paper, we report some details of the source mechanism and the ground motions during the earthquake, and discuss the ground motion characteristics related to the damage in the Tsukidate and Furukawa areas. Damage grades in Tsukidate, where the largest peak ground accelerations were observed, are not severe in comparison to those in Furukawa. The pseudo-velocity response spectrum for the ground motions observed in the Furukawa area is similar to that in the JR Takatori records for the 1995 Kobe earthquake. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Wide-area land subsidence caused by the 2011 off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake	2012	Soils and Foundations	52	5		842	855			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84876671643&partnerID=40&md5=f864c1109f63dbbd85e72043b2e32275	Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, Japan	Imakiire, T., Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, Japan; Koarai, M., Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, Japan	This paper gives an overview of the crustal deformation caused by the 2011 off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake (hereinafter: the Tohoku Earthquake) as detected by the GPS Earth Observation Network (GEONET), a GPS continuous observation system operated by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI), and of ground deformation resulting from liquefaction triggered by the earthquake motion as determined by a leveling survey. A very large part of the Japanese archipelago was affected by the crustal deformation caused by the mainshock. The subsidence in the Pacific coastal area of the Tohoku region is especially remarkable. Based on a resurvey after the earthquake, the GSI revised the coordinates and heights of survey marks, including the Origin of the Japanese Horizontal Control Network and the Origin of the Japanese Vertical Control Network. We estimated the geometry of the seismogenic fault of the Tohoku Earthquake, as well as a slip model for the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, based on crustal deformation data. Postseismic crustal deformation was also observed by GEONET. Even though the area that coseismicaly subsided is undergoing partial uplift from postseismic deformation, such uplift is not rapid enough to make up for the coseismic subsidence within the next several years. The earthquake caused liquefaction in large parts of the Kanto Region, especially on the Tokyo Bay side and at the lower reaches of the Tone River. Liquefaction was concentrated in areas of land reclamation and former river channels, where it is easy to recognize using time-series geospatial information such as olden topographic maps and olden aerial photographs. To determine the amount of land subsidence (cm) due to liquefaction in Urayasu City, the GSI carried out a leveling survey and compared the differences between pre-and post-earthquake LIDAR survey data with the relative subsidence obtained by leveling. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

A multiple series of Swedish Weight Sounding tests were carried out at Sawara of Katori City, Hinode of Itako City, and Wanigawa and Fukashiba of Kamisu City. The soil profiles responsible for the damage inflicted by soil liquefaction were demonstrated along with the help of SPT data. At some locations where the soil samples of erupted sand boils were retrieved, the profiles of relative density and factor of safety against liquefaction with depth are estimated and discussed in detail. The use of Swedish weight sounding tests along with a help of SPT soil profiling proved an effective method for detecting liquefiable soil layers responsible for widespread soil liquefaction induced damage. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Damage patterns of river embankments due to the 2011 off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake and a numerical modeling of the deformation of river embankments with a clayey subsoil layer	2012	Soils and Foundations	52	5		890	909			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84876680450&partnerID=40&md5=205306ec75f5ac94a72fd80de0ad4753	Department of Civil and Earth Resources Engineering, Kyoto University, Japan; Nikken Sekkei Civil Engineering Ltd., Osaka, Japan	Oka, F., Department of Civil and Earth Resources Engineering, Kyoto University, Japan; Tsai, P., Department of Civil and Earth Resources Engineering, Kyoto University, Japan; Kimoto, S., Department of Civil and Earth Resources Engineering, Kyoto University, Japan; Kato, R., Nikken Sekkei Civil Engineering Ltd., Osaka, Japan	Due to the 2011 off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake, which had a magnitude of 9.0, many soil-made infrastructures, such as river dikes, road embankments, railway foundations and coastal dikes, were damaged. The river dikes and their related structures were damaged at 2115 sites throughout the Tohoku and Kanto areas, including Iwate, Miyagi, Fukushima, Ibaraki and Saitama Prefectures, as well as the Tokyo Metropolitan District. In the first part of the present paper, the main patterns of the damaged river embankments are presented and reviewed based on the in situ research by the authors, MLIT (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism) and JICE (Japan Institute of Construction Engineering). The main causes of the damage were (1) liquefaction of the foundation ground, (2) liquefaction of the soil in the river embankments due to the water-saturated region above the ground level, and (3) the long duration of the earthquake, the enormity of fault zone and the magnitude of the quake. In the second part of the paper, we analyze model river embankments on a foundation ground with various soil proiles, including a clayey soil layer and various ground water tables, using a dynamic liquefaction analysis method. From the analysis results, we find the effects of the soil proiles and the duration time of the earthquake motion on the deformation behavior of the river embankments. The results are consistent with those of the investigation of the features of the deformation and the failure of the embankments due to the 2011 off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Ltd., Japan	The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake caused the severe liquefaction of reclaimed lands in the Tokyo Bay area, from Shinkiba in Tokyo through Urayasu, Ichikawa and Narashino Cities to Chiba City. However, the reclaimed lands that had been improved by the sand compaction pile method, the gravel drain method or other methods did not liquefy. The reclaimed lands that did liquefy had been constructed after around 1966 with soil dredged from the bottom of the bay. The dredged and filled soils were estimated to have been liquefied by the earthquake. Seismic intensities in the liquefied zones were not high, although the liquefied grounds were covered with boiled sand. Most likely it was the very long duration of the main shock, along with the large aftershock that hit 29 min later, which induced the severe liquefaction. Sidewalks and alleys buckled at several sites, probably due to a kind of sloshing around of the liquefied ground. Moreover, much sand boiled from the ground and the ground subsided significantly because the liquefied soil was very fine. Many houses settled notably and tilted. In Urayasu City, 3680 houses were more than partially destroyed. Sewage pipes meandered or were broken, their joints were extruded from the ground, and many manholes were horizontally sheared. This remarkable damage may also have occurred due to the sloshing around of the liquefied ground. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

In particular, the hillside embankments for residential use surrounding the downtown of Sendai city suffered serious damage. Many hillside lands which had been damaged during the 1978 off Miyagi-Prefecture earthquake were subjected to further damage. Typical damaged hillside embankments in Sendai city were investigated and the causes of the damage were discussed in this paper. The main cause of the damage to housing was not the seismic motion but the ground displacement of the fill embankment. A comparison of the damage from the 2011 earthquake with that from the 1978 earthquake indicates that the countermeasures constructed after the 1978 earthquake performed well in that they prevented large landslide type failure; however, they were not successful in reducing the amount of damage to housing or housing lots due to ground displacements from cracks, differential settlement, and shallow slips. A classification of failure types of fill embankment is proposed to be of assistance in the choice of countermeasures. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Because the amount of damage was on such a huge scale, emergency restoration was difficult and many lessons were learnt. The cause of the damage in most cases was liquefaction either in the foundation or in the levee body, and the latter was recognized as a new technical problem. Many levees in the coastal area experienced the combined effects of the tsunami with the co-seismic subsidence of the earth's crust. Among the many examples of damage, one positive issue was that damage mitigation measures such as drainage and soil improvement were found to be effective. The present text addresses the findings and lessons learnt from the authors' emergency activities after the quake. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that (1) Extensive soil liquefaction occurred along the coast of Tokyo Bay and around the floodplain of the Tonegawa River. Liquefaction was primarily found within the relatively newly reclaimed area, with numerous sand boils and large ground settlements up to 60 cm, accompanied by the settlement/tilting of wooden and reinforced concrete buildings supported by spread foundations. The extent and the distribution of the damage were significantly affected by the local soil conditions, including the thickness and the age of the reclaimed fills, the depth to the bedrock or the natural site period, and whether remedial measures had been taken against soil liquefaction, as well as the effects of structure-soil-structure interaction. (2) Numerous houses in Sendai's hilly residential areas constructed with the cut-and fill method were badly damaged not only by the simple collapse of retaining walls, but also by slope failures in the fills. It was found that most of the slope failures occurred on earth fills. (3) Several pile-supported buildings tilted and settled not only in the Tohoku region, but also on the Kanto plain, implying damage to pile foundations. Ground subsidence with sand boils around those buildings suggests that soil liquefaction might have played a significant role in intensifying the damage. (4) Within Onagawa and Rikuzen-Takata, several steel and reinforced concrete structures were knocked over by tsunami surges, probably after having suffered damage to their pile foundations. Much of the pile damage was concentrated (a) at the joints between pile caps and the piles themselves and (b) near the pile heads. The buildings suffering such damage were old; apparently their pile foundations were not designed to withstand earthquakes. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Ltd., Japan; Furui, T., Etajima City Office, Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan	As a result of the 2011 off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake, five slope failures occurred in a residential area on artificial valley fills in Taiyo New Town, Yamamoto, Miyagi Prefecture. The site was constructed by leveling a hilly area and using the cut materials as ill for the valleys to provide foundation ground for houses. The ill material was sandy and was derived from the weathering of tuffaceous sandstone which had formed the natural ground. Each of the ive slope failures was observed to have occurred either at the edge of the artiicial valley ills or within the embankment sections that had been widened for road construction. Laboratory tests show that the fill, which had a fines content of Fc-20%, had a very low liquefaction resistance, which further decreased with the application of initial shear stress. A pseudo-static slope stability analysis, using conventional strength parameters, could not explain the slope failure at one of the sites that failed, but it could explain the slope failure when the dynamic strength was used to represent the soil strength at the slip surface. Thus, the slope failures in Taiyo New Town, at least at the one site analyzed in this study, could be attributed to the liquefaction of the ill material induced by the intense shaking. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Use of fall cone test as measurement of shear strength for soft clay materials	2012	Soils and Foundations	52	4		590	599			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84871013900&partnerID=40&md5=9416816a3be4bcd81cf223e73393941c	Hokkaido University, Japan; TOA Corporation, Japan	Tanaka, H., Hokkaido University, Japan; Hirabayashi, H., TOA Corporation, Japan; Matsuoka, T., TOA Corporation, Japan; Kaneko, H., Hokkaido University, Japan	A fall cone test (FCT) was carried out to obtain the undrained shear strength (su), and to measure the sensitivity (St) of intact and remolded samples from several sites in Japan. The value of s u from FCT was compared with half of the unconfined compression strength (qu/2), which is a standard way to evaluate su for practical design in Japan. It is found that su from FCT is neither related with qu/2 nor used directly as a design value. S t was also obtained by field and laboratory vane tests. A comparison study revealed that St by FCT is as much as 10 times larger than that by the field vane. The large difference in St measured by different testing methods can be attributed to remolding methods. That is, the remold condition for FCT was created by kneading the sample in a plastic bag by hand, while in the field vane, the ground was remolded by 30 turns of the vane blade. This indicates that the degree of the reduction in strength caused by the turn of the vane blade is less significant than that caused by remolding by kneading. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

It is the phenomenon that the fine particles in soil gradually migrate through the voids between the coarse particles, leaving behind the soil skeleton. In this paper, the main focus is on the changes in soil strength due to internal erosion. A series of one-dimensional upward seepage tests at a constant water head is performed to cause internal erosion in a soil sample by controlling the three variable parameters, namely (a) the fine content, (b) the relative density of the soil, and (c) the maximum imposed hydraulic gradient on the specimen. The mechanical consequences of the internal erosion are examined by cone penetration tests. The internal erosion indicated by the loss of fine particles causes changes in the void ratio and a significant increase in hydraulic conductivity, resulting in a decrease in the soil strength from its initial value. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

However, only the unload/reload stress-strain relations at different confining pressures (except for the primary loading pressure at the first step) can be obtained from an ML test, and the reloading relations become softer with the increases in negative irreversible axial strain increments that have taken place during the respective immediately preceding unloading regimes. This phenomenon is formulated by a unique empirical equation for the CMG tests. Undamaged reloading stress-strain curves (URCs) were inferred by removing the damage effects from measured reloading curves (MRCs) in the ML TC test based on this correlation. A method was developed within the framework of the proportional rule to infer primary loading curves (PLCs) at different confining pressures from the URCs and the PLC at the first step obtained from a given ML TC test. A procedure was formulated to modify the PLCs obtained by this procedure based on the PLCs measured at stresses exceeding the yield stress for large-scale yielding during reloading at different confining pressures in the ML test. This method was validated by comparing the PLCs obtained from the results of a pair of ML tests, increasing and decreasing the confining pressure, with those obtained from a set of SL TC tests at different confining pressures. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Until now most investigations of particle shape have been two-dimensional and size has been most often assessed using sieving. This paper makes use of recent developments in three-dimensional imaging technologies to characterize the internal features of a soil in 3D including quantification of particle morphology. The soil investigated was Reigate sand (from Southeast England), a geologically old sand, which in its intact state exhibits significant interlocking amongst the constituent grains. Intact and reconstituted specimens having similar densities were tested under triaxial compression. The specimens were impregnated with an epoxy resin at three different stages of shear deformation and small cores from each specimen were scanned using X-ray micro-tomography. Different systems and scanning parameters were explored in order to obtain 3D, high-resolution, images with a voxel size of 5 um (0.018 x d50). The morphology measurements were compared with sieve data and measurements obtained using a 2D, image based, laser system. The sieve size is shown to correlate well with the intermediate principal axis length. Clear differences are noted between the 2D and 3D shape measurements. Breakage of fractured grains, along existing fissures, occurs both during reconstitution and shearing of the intact soil, a phenomenon that cannot be observed using invasive techniques such as sieve analysis. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.	3D microscopy; Dilatancy; Fabric/structure of soils; Locked sand; Morphology; Shearing	3-D microscopy; 3-d shape measurement; Dilatancy; England; High resolution; Image-based; Internal features; Invasive techniques; Laser systems; Locked sand; Mechanical response; Natural sand; Particle morphologies; Particle shape; Principal axis; Reconstituted specimens; Scanning parameters; Sieve analysis; Three dimensional imaging; Triaxial compression; Voxel size; X-ray micro-tomography; Epoxy resins; Sand; Shearing; Sieves; Soils; Three dimensional computer graphics; Morphology						Al-Raoush, R., Microstructure characterization of granular materials (2007) Physica A, 377 (2), pp. 545-558; Altuhafi, F., O'Sullivan, C., Cavarretta, I., Analysis of an image based method for size and shape quantification of sand Submitted to ASCE Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering, , in press; Atwood, R.C., Jones, J.R., Lee, P.D., Hench, L.L., Analysis of pore interconnectivity in bioactive glass foams using X-ray microtomography (2004) Scripta Materialia, 51, pp. 1029-1033; Beucher, S., Lantuejoul, C., Use of watersheds in contour detection (1979) Proceedings of International Workshops on Image Processing, CCETT, , Rennes, France; Bishop, A.W., Wesley, L.D., A hydraulic apparatus for controlled stress path testing (1975) Géotechnique, 25 (4), pp. 657-670; (2007) Carl-Zeiss-Micro Imaging, , Axiovision, Release 4.6.3, Gottingen; Cavarretta, I., (2009) The Influence of Particle Characteristics on the Engineering Behaviour of Granular Materials, , PhD Thesis, Dept.

The parameters determined are the Mohr-Coulomb effective stress strength parameters together with the stiffness parameters; tangent stiffness for primary oedometer loading, secant stiffness in undrained and drained triaxial tests, unloading/reloading stiffness and the power for stress level dependency of stiffness. The oedometer data are obtained from three different Bangkok soil layers: soft clay at 6-8 m depths; medium clay at 12-14 m depths; and stiff clay at 15.5-18 m depths. The triaxial tests data are carried out for soft and stiff clays at depths of 5.5-6 m and of 16-18 m under both undrained and drained conditions, respectively. Finally, two sets of parameters for soft and stiff Bangkok clays are numerically calibrated against undrained and drained triaxial results using PLAXIS finite element software. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

DEM analysis of energy dissipation in crushable soils	2012	Soils and Foundations	52	4		644	657		4	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84871001185&partnerID=40&md5=07d443ad5aaf157c7008e15d2c3bff76	Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong	Wang, J., Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Yan, H., Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong	It is well known that particle crushing plays a critical role in the mechanical behavior of granular soils. Understanding energy dissipation under the influence of particle breakage is of key importance to the development of micromechanics-based constitutive models for sands. This paper reports the original results of the energy input/dissipation of an idealized crushable soil using 3D DEM simulations. Particle breakage is modeled as the disintegration of the synthetic agglomerate particles which are made up of parallelbonded elementary spheres. A parametric study is performed to fully investigate the effects of initial specimen density and crushability on the energy allocation of the crushable soil. The simulation results show that the initial specimen density and the crushability strongly affect the energy allocation of the soil both at small and large strains. The major roles of particle breakage, which itself only dissipates a negligible amount of input energy, are to advance changes in the soil fabric and to promote the interparticle friction dissipation. Particularly, at small strains, particle breakage disrupts the strain energy buildup, and thus, reduces the mobilized shear strength and dilatancy of a granular soil. At large strains, where particle breakage is greatly reduced, steady energy dissipation by interparticle friction and mechanical damping is observed. Furthermore, it is found that shear bands develop in most dense crushable specimens at large strains, but they are only weakly correlated to the anisotropy of the accumulated friction dissipation. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The results show how the bearing capacity is related to the coefficient of variation and correlation length scale in both shear strength and unit weight. Based on the results, the authors propose an overdesign factor, tolerable percentage of defective core specimens, and resistance factors for LRFD ultimate limit state of surface footings on cement-treated ground in order to achieve a target reliability index and probability of failure. The proposed method is illustrated through example calculations based on the spatial variation of unconfined compressive strength measured using a variety of cement-mixing methods from projects in Japan. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

This paper describes the site's geotechnical characteristics and experimental arrangements before defining and describing the stable, unstable or meta-stable responses observed under various combinations of cyclic loading. The interpretation draws on numerical analyses and a parallel model study by Tsuha et al. (2012), relating the field response to the probable shaft shear stress distributions and local effective stress conditions. It is argued that cyclic degradation is controlled by: (i) contraction in the highly constrained interface shear zone and (ii) kinematic yielding within the surrounding soil mass. Finally, interaction diagrams linking shaft response to cyclic loading parameters are proposed based on the field test data and a simplified cyclic capacity predictive approach. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

One model is the current default model (Model 1) used when project-specific laboratory pullout testing is not available and the other when this data is available (Model 2). The accuracy of the models is quantified using bias statistics where bias is defined as the ratio of measured pullout capacity to predicted value. Bias statistics are also a necessary precursor for reliability-based load and resistance factor design calibration for the ultimate pullout limit state in the internal stability design of geogrid reinforced soil walls. Bias statistics using Model 2 show that pullout predictions are very accurate with negligible scatter. However, the default model is shown to be very conservative on average with large scatter in bias values which also varies with magnitude of predicted pullout capacity. A modified formulation for Model 1 is proposed that has the same number of empirical coefficients as the current expression (i.e. two). The modified formulation gives improved accuracy based on the computed mean and coefficient of variation of bias values, and eliminates the significant model bias that is present for the current model. A final outcome from analysis of all available pullout data is that a factor of safety F=2 is recommended for allowable stress design (ASD) when using the current PWRC default Model 1, and a value of F=1.25 is recommended when using Model 2 with project-specific pullout testing. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

A series of centrifuge model tests under rainfall conditions were conducted on slopes with different types of cracks. The histories of suction and displacement of the slope were measured during the tests to investigate the infiltration-deformation-failure process of the slopes. The wetting front curved notably near the crack under rainfall conditions. The deformation of the slope was mainly caused by the saturation of soil and crack-affected water infiltration under rainfall conditions. The displacement process of the slopes with cracks can be divided into a small displacement stage, a rapid increase stage, and a stable stage. The influence of the crack on the infiltration and deformation of the slope decreased with increasing distance from the crack. Rainfall induced significant vertical deformation near the vertical crack rather than horizontal deformation. In contrast to the oblique crack, the vertical crack on the slope top was unlikely to lead to global landslide under rainfall conditions. The deformation-failure behavior of the slope with cracks was also affected by the rainfall style and rain intensity. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The confining-stress dependency of the shear stress ratio at the critical state, briefly referred to as the confining-stress dependency, is another important factor that should be taken into consideration when discussing the mechanical behavior of the rock. In this paper, based on an elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model for soft sedimentary rock (Zhang et al., 2005), a new model capable of describing both the inherent anisotropy and the confining-stress dependency of soft sedimentary rock is proposed in the framework of generalized stress space, called the t ij concept (Nakai and Mihara, 1984), and the subloading yield surface (Hashiguchi and Ueno, 1977; Hashiguchi, 1989). In order to describe the confining-stress dependency, an evolution equation for the shear stress ratio at the critical state M* is introduced. A transformed stress, proposed by Boehler and Sawczuk (1977) and first introduced into a constitutive model by Oka et al. (2002), is also adopted into the model. In order to examine the performance of the newly proposed model, triaxial compression tests for soft sedimentary rock under different loading conditions were simulated and the results have been compared with the corresponding test results obtained from the authors and other researches available in the literature. It is found that the model can describe both the inherent anisotropy and the confining-stress dependency of soft sedimentary rock using a set of parameters with a fixed value for a given material. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Warning systems based on rainfall or ground displacement measurements are popular methods currently being used to minimize the hazards of landslides. When field hydrological monitoring is used, it usually involves a limited number of sensors for either positive or negative pore-water pressure measurements. The available numerical schemes that couple pore-water pressure with a geomechanical analysis are the most suitable for shallow slope failures. Due to the variable and transient nature of the hydrological conditions in earth slopes, field measurements that reflect the pore-water pressure profile on a realtime basis would be highly desirable. Thus, the authors have developed a piezometer system that is based on optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) pressure sensors. With this system, an array of nine sensors was installed in a single, 60-m-deep borehole to monitor the porewater pressure profile in a highway slope in Southern Taiwan. This paper describes the details of the FBG sensor array installation in the field and the data obtained throughout three typhoons from 2008 to 2010. The results demonstrate that the field readings can be readily incorporated into the existing mechanics-based analytical framework and can predict the potential of an upcoming slope failure. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

It is typified by non-convergent compression paths and critical state lines that are non-unique and which are dependent on the initial sample density. Many soil mechanics theories assume soils to have unique normal compression and/or critical state lines, which is not the case for a transitional soil. For such a soil it would therefore be difficult to identify the effects of structure on the mechanics since there is no unique behaviour of the soil when reconstituted. This paper describes series of oedometer tests that were performed to investigate in more detail when and why non-convergent compression behaviour might be expected, as a first step to identifying which soils are transitional. The effects of mixing soils of different grain sizes and mineralogies were explored, the tests revealing that convergent or non-convergent behaviour could be brought about either by relatively small changes to the proportions of the soil particles or by changes to their nature. It was also found that in some soils with non-convergent compression behaviour there was particle breakage while in others there was not. Since the factors that influence the mode of compression behaviour were found to be complex, it is concluded that each new soil encountered must be assessed individually for whether it is transitional, and that the accuracy of void ratio measurements is of particular importance in establishing this reliably. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Emphasis is given to the simulation of the softening regime of the stress-strain response of the material with special attention to minimizing mesh-dependency. A pragmatic and easy-to-implement procedure is developed for the calibration under the framework of friction hardening/cohesion softening. Fracture energy regularization is applied in the back-analysis of the triaxial tests to remove mesh dependency. The impact of different mesh designs is investigated. Oriented mesh with the same inclination as the shear band provides the most realistic outcome and is able of capturing real shear band thickness. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Simulations were carried out, in which these elements were used in combination with a linear elastic-perfectly plastic model to describe the interaction between the ground and the inclusions. With this simple interaction model, however, it was not possible to reproduce the observed behavior of a full-scale, experimental wall or the results of pull-out tests carried out on the same wall under the same set of parameters. Therefore, two more complex models were introduced for the soil-inclusion interaction, which led to a much better agreement between the numerical results and the experimental observations. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Effect of principal stress axis rotation on cyclic plastic deformation characteristics of unsaturated base course material	2012	Soils and Foundations	52	3		465	480			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84871002687&partnerID=40&md5=ff384c6f814cb492b5c3a4254aa2e41b	Graduate School of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Japan	Inam, A., Graduate School of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Japan; Ishikawa, T., Graduate School of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Japan; Miura, S., Graduate School of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Japan	It is generally observed that the stress state induced through traffic loads inside the substructure of pavements cannot be exactly reproduced in laboratory element tests. Moreover, there are not sufficient studies that examine the behavior of granular material under unsaturated conditions, although such conditions are very prevalent in pavement structures. In this research, an attempt is made to determine the cyclic plastic deformation characteristics of unsaturated granular base course material, and to examine the effect of the rotation of the principal stress axis (experienced by pavement elements under traffic loads) on the mechanical behavior of unsaturated granular base course material by applying various loading methods. A series of laboratory element tests using a multi-ring shear apparatus, which can take into account the rotation of the principal stress axis, were carried out on granular base course material under different moisture contents. The experimental results show that the moisture content has an obvious effect on both the shear behavior and the cyclic plastic deformation of granular base course material. However, the moisture content for the maximum deformation of granular base course material varies according to the loading method. It is also explained that cyclic plastic deformation considerably increases due to the rotation of the principal stress axis under repeated axial and shear loading tests. Therefore, the principal stress axis rotation has a significant influence on the cyclic plastic deformation of unsaturated granular base course material. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The aim of most of these studies has been to calculate secondary consolidation with high accuracy in order to evaluate the long-term settlement of large-scale structures. In a previous study, the long-term consolidation characteristics of Osaka Bay clay, collected from the construction site of the Kansai International Airport, were examined, and a simplified method based on the isotache concept, using a compression curve and the relationship between the consolidation yield stress (preconsolidation pressure) and the strain rate, was proposed. The former and the latter were obtained from constant rate of strain consolidation (CRS) tests and long-term consolidation (LT) tests, respectively. The latter is expressed by an equation with three isotache parameters. In addition, it is noteworthy that the isotache parameters can be commonly determined for the Osaka Bay clays retrieved from various depths up to 300 m below the seabed. In the present study, the proposed method was applied to worldwide clays with various characteristics using the common values for the isotache parameters determined for the Osaka Bay clays. It was found that the long-term consolidation behavior of those worldwide clays can be well characterized by the proposed method, along with the common values for the isotache parameters. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The caisson was 12 m long and had circular cross-sections whose diameters were 5 m in the upper portion and 4 m in the lower portion. The test site was located on soil with a high gravel content. A site investigation, including laboratory and field tests, was carried out. A six-component Winkler-beam model was applied to simulate the caisson response in the lateral load test. To determine the nonlinear properties of the Winkler springs, a method based on large-scale geotechnical field testing was proposed. With this method, the soil springs could be properly set and the Winkler-beam model could reasonably capture the lateral behavior of the caisson foundation. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The tested small bridge models are (1) a conventional-type comprising a girder, supported by a pair of gravity-type abutments (without pile foundation) via bearings (fixed and movable), and unreinforced backfill, (2) the girder and the abutments of the above are integrated (without using bearings), (3) the backfill of the above is reinforced with two layers of large-diameter nails connected to the abutment top and the toe or the heel of the abutment footing and (4) the bottom nails of the above are replaced with longer ones connected to the toe of the abutment footing. Their dynamic behavior was analyzed as a damped single-degree-of-freedom system. The dynamic stability of the bridge was found to increase with an increase in (i) the dynamic strength against the response acceleration, (ii) the initial stiffness, (iii) the dynamic ductility (i.e., a smaller decreasing rate of stiffness during dynamic loading) and (iv) the damping ratio. When factors (ii) and (iii) are high enough, the natural frequency of a bridge can be kept much higher than the input frequency, and thus, the response acceleration can be kept low. All these factors can be improved by integrating the girder, the abutments and the backfill together with part of the supporting ground. In a series of static model tests, lateral cyclic displacements, caused by the seasonal thermal deformation of the girders with prototypes, were applied to the top of a small abutment model. The active failure in the backfill and the detrimental effects of large passive pressure, both developing due to the dual ratchet mechanism, can be effectively restrained by reinforcing the backfill and supporting the ground with nails connected to the top and the bottom of the abutments. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The enzyme urease is used to enhance the rate and the magnitude of the calcium carbonate precipitation. Evolutions in the mechanical and the hydraulic properties of treated sand samples are examined through unconfined compression and permeability tests, respectively. The grout is mainly composed of urease, which bio-catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia, urea, and calcium chloride solutions. This method employs chemical reactions catalyzed by the enzyme, and ultimately acquires precipitated calcium carbonate within soils. The mechanical test results show that even a small percentage of calcium carbonate, precipitated within soils of interest, brings about a drastic improvement in the strength of the soils compared to that of untreated soils - the unconfined compressive strength of the samples treated with < 10 vol% calcium carbonate precipitation against the initial pore volume ranges from ∼400 kPa to 1.6 MPa. Likewise, the hydraulic test results indicate the significant impervious effects of the grouting technique - the permeability of the improved samples shows more than one order of magnitude smaller than that of the untreated soils. Evolutions in the measured hydraulic conductivity and porosity are followed by a flow simulator that accounts for the solute transport process of the injected solutions and the chemical reaction of the calcite precipitation. Predictions of the changes in permeability with time overestimate the test measurements, but those of the changes in porosity show a good agreement with the actual measurements, indicating that such simulations should become a significant supplementary tool when considering real site applications. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The mechanical behaviour of this coarse soil was studied in the laboratory using a large-scale triaxial cell. The soil taken from the fouled ballast layer of an ancient railway was re-compacted to a dry density of 2.01 Mg/m3 at three water contents (4, 6, and 12%) corresponding to three values of the initial degree of saturation (32, 48, and 100% respectively). Both monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests were performed under constant water content conditions. The experimental results gave the following evidence of the significant effect of the water content on the soil mechanical behaviour: (i) the lower the compaction water content, the higher the shear strength; (ii) a permanent axial strain of 0.4% was found after a large number of cycles at a water content of 4%, while it was 1.4% at the higher water content of 6%. For the saturated soil specimen, failure was even observed after a limited number of cycles. Based on the results obtained, a constitutive model for permanent deformation was elaborated, that accounts for the stress level, the number of cycles and the soil water content. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

A series of undrained cyclic torsional shear tests was performed on saturated Toyoura sand specimens up to single amplitude shear strain exceeding 50%. Three types of cyclic loading patterns, i.e., stress reversal, intermediate and non-reversal, were employed by varying the initial static shear level and the cyclic shear stress amplitude. The observed types of failure could be distinguished into liquefaction (cyclic and rapid flow) and residual deformation by comparing both monotonic and cyclic undrained behavior. It was found that the presence of initial static shear does not always lead to an increase in the resistance to liquefaction or strain accumulation; they could either increase or decrease with an increasing initial static shear level depending on the type of loading pattern and failure behavior. In addition, according to the failure behavior which the specimens exhibited, three modes of development of large residual deformation were observed. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The writers have collected and organized a much larger database of more than 600 laboratory pullout box and in situ pullout tests from among the Japanese literature. The new database is a useful reference for design engineers to match project-specific soils to previous pullout tests and to check the accuracy of the current lower-bound design curves proposed in the late 70s and 80s. Today, only the ribbed-type steel reinforcement strips are used. The new data show that a three-parameter exponential function better captures the trend in pullout data for ribbed steel reinforcement than the current bi-linear models adopted from European practice. The formulations also have the advantage of being smoothly continuous with depth. Parameter values are determined for default pullout models that can be used in load and resistance factor design (LRFD) and for the current lower-bound (factor of safety) allowable stress design (ASD). The current PWRC model and a newly proposed model for ribbed steel strip reinforcement, that include the soil coefficient of uniformity (Uc) in their formulations, are shown to be no more accurate than the simpler default models without this term. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

An understanding of the three styles of responses is provided by experiments involving a highly instrumented model displacement pile and an array of soil stress sensors installed in fine sand in a pressurised calibration chamber. The different patterns of effective stress developing on and around the shaft are reported, along with the results of static load tests that track the effects on shaft capacity. The interpretation links these observations to the sand's stress-strain behaviour. The interface-shear characteristics, the kinematic yielding, the local densification, the growth of a fractured interface-shear zone and the restrained dilatancy at the pile-soil interface are all found to be important. The model tests are shown to be compatible with the full-scale behaviour and to provide key information for improving the modelling and the design rules. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The system response considered in the analysis is the safety factor obtained using the strength-reduction technique. The deterministic model makes use of the kinematic approach of the limit analysis theory. The Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) methodology is employed for the probabilistic analysis. The soil shear strength parameters and the footing load components are considered as random variables. A reliability analysis and a global sensitivity analysis are performed. Also, a parametric study showing the effect of the different statistical characteristics of the random variables on the variability of the safety factor is presented and discussed. It is shown that the use of the safety factor (based on the strength-reduction technique) for the system response is of significant interest in the reliability analysis, since it takes into account the simultaneous effect of soil punching and footing sliding and it requires a unique reliability analysis for both failure modes. Furthermore, it allows the rigorous determination of the zones of predominance of soil punching and footing sliding in the interaction diagram for different cases of soil and/or loading uncertainties. Finally, it is shown that the loading configurations located in the zone of the footing sliding predominance exhibit a more significant variability in the safety factor compared to those located in the zone of the soil punching predominance. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

In the present study, the shear wave velocity structures of intertidal flats were explored by a surface wave method called the multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW), which is a very useful method for surveying the sedimentary stratigraphy of various intertidal flats, in order to evaluate the cross-shore and the along-shore sedimentary stratigraphy. Field surveys were carried out in sandflats, mudflats, and subtropical tidal flats during spring tides in summer, when these flats were exposed. In the sandflats, the sedimentary stratigraphy evaluated by MASW (as distributions of the shear wave velocity/stiffness) and by physical soil tests (as distributions of the void ratio) can be explained as being a consequence of the cyclic elastoplastic contraction of the soils that are subjected to a variety of suction dynamics under the tide-induced groundwater table fluctuations. In the mudflats, the soil stiffness was extremely homogeneous, although a variation in the void structure was observed in association with the grain-size distributions, because suction did not develop in the soil. In the subtropical intertidal flats, lime rock was clearly identified beneath the soil sediments. A spectrum analysis in the cross-shore direction was carried out in order to quantitatively characterize the dominant wavelength for the variations in both shear wave velocity and morphological ground surface profiles of intertidal flats with various scales and soil types. In the intertidal flats with a multibar-trough structure, dominant wavelengths in the range 40-90 m were obtained corresponding to the unit length of the bar-trough structure, while in the mudflat or the huge-scale homogeneous sandflat, no dominant wavelength was obtained. In the subtropical tidal flats, the dominant wavelength was strongly influenced by protruding lime rock rather than by the morphological ground surface profile. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Furthermore, two-dimensional FEM analyses of the horizontal cross sections of the pile-soil systems were carried out. The centrifuge test results show that the lateral resistance of a new pile, located among existing piles, shows slight increases. The existing piles increase the horizontal subgrade reaction of the upper part of the new pile, but slightly decrease that of the lower part of the new pile. Numerical analyses reveal that the key to whether an existing pile increases the horizontal subgrade reaction of a new pile or not, is the soil displacement at the location of the existing pile. An existing pile increases the horizontal subgrade reaction of a new pile when the existing pile displacement is less than the soil displacement caused by the new pile. Conversely, an existing pile decreases the horizontal subgrade reaction of a new pile when the existing pile displacement is greater than the soil displacement caused by the new pile. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Seng S., Tanaka H.	Properties of very soft clays: A study of thixotropic hardening and behavior under low consolidation pressure	2012	Soils and Foundations	52	2		335	345		1	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84871022744&partnerID=40&md5=91f44ce95d8f26cfc860cf78e187ef8b	Hokkaido University, Japan	Seng, S., Hokkaido University, Japan; Tanaka, H., Hokkaido University, Japan	In a study on the properties of very soft clays, bender element testing was used to evaluate thixotropic hardening behavior; that is, to measure the stiffness with resting time under constant volume and water content. A laboratory vane test, which measures the undrained shear strength of the materials, was also carried out for comparison purposes. To investigate the mechanism of the thixotropic phenomenon, a consolidation test with very low pressure was also performed in a cell equipped with bender elements. The most important findings from this study are as follows: (1) regardless of soil types, the effect of thixotropy was significant around the liquid limit state and less remarkable at the lower and higher ranges; (2) the shear modulus at the liquid limit after 24 h resting is around 200 kPa; (3) the correlation between the shear modulus and the undrained shear strength of very soft clays is similar to that of cementtreated soil proposed by Seng and Tanaka (2011); (4) the increment of the shear modulus developed in the thixotropy process appears to be noticeably higher than that in the secondary consolidation process. It is believed that these findings are very useful to establish a new theory for the consolidation of ground filled by very soft clays or dredged soils with extremely high water content as well as to understand the effects of ageing on the consolidation properties of natural soils. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Two series of special constant-rate-of-strain (CRS) 1D compression tests, with sustained loading at intermediate stages, were performed on kaolin with and without cement-mixing. Most of the air-dried specimens were made partially or fully saturated at intermediate stress levels. The effects of the degree of saturation, the wetting process period, the stress level at which wetting was made, the strain rate during loading and the over-consolidation history applied by compaction during the preparation of the specimens were evaluated. The effects of wetting, viscous property and ageing, observed in the experiments, were significant and complicated. A nonlinear three-component elasto-viscoplastic model, that had been modified to take into account the effects of wetting, was further modified to account for the ageing effects. The effects of wetting and ageing were described by a decrease and an increase in the inviscid yield stress at a fixed irreversible strain in the plastic component. The viscous property changed from the basic type, Isotach to TESRA as the ageing effects due to cement-hydration developed. The stress-strain relations and the time histories of stress and strain, during complicated loading and wetting histories applied in the experiments, were successfully simulated by the modified model. © 2012.

In particular, the data assimilation method referred to as the particle filter (PF) can be applied to nonlinear and non-Gaussian problems, and it holds the greatest potential for application to geotechnical problems. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the theoretical and the practical effectiveness of the PF for a geotechnical problem, i.e., applying the methodology to numerical experiments and actual model tests to identify the parameters of elasto-plastic geomaterials. Since the mechanical behavior of soils depends on both the current stress and the recent stress history of the soil, the sampling method called SIS, which can take into account the stress history experienced by soils, identifies the parameters of elasto-plastic geomaterials remarkably well. The results of the numerical tests have shown that the parameters identified by the PF based on the SIS have converged into their true values, and the approach presented in this study has shown great promise as an accurate parameter identification method for elasto-plastic geomaterials. Moreover, the simulation results using the identified parameters were close to the actual measurement data, and long-term predictions with high accuracy could be achieved, even though short-term measurement data were used. The PF approach produces more information about the parameters of interest than simple estimated values obtained from optimization methods. Namely, the identification comes in the form of probability density functions. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In most studies, experimental methods have been used to determine the relationship between UCS and drilling data. In this paper, an analytical model is proposed to describe rock drilling processes using drag bits and rotary drills, and to deduce the relations among rock properties, bit shapes, and drilling parameters (rotary speed, thrust, torque, and stroke). In this model, a drilling process is divided into cycles, each of which includes two motions: feeding and cutting. Feeding is treated as an indentation motion. There is a linear relation between indentation pressure (thrust) and the indentation depth (penetration rate). The cutting forces and friction forces of both the rake surface and the flank surface are examined. Also, a virtual base is set to the model to simulate the contact surface between the flank surface of the bit and the rock. According to this model, drilling torque consists of four parts respectively generated from cutting, friction, feeding, and idle running. Torque caused by friction and idle running is ineffective for drilling, whereas that caused by cutting and indentation is effective. Similar to torque, specific energy also has four parts respectively from cutting, friction, feeding, and idle running. For the purposes of this study, effective specific energy is defined as the sum of specific energy consumed by cutting and feeding. Effective specific energy is independent of the penetration rate. Since it is proportional to the UCS of the rocks, it is not influenced by the penetration rate, and is more useful in the evaluation of UCS than other parameters. Some laboratory and field tests were conducted, and the results verified the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

A triaxial compression test was conducted on soil called Yamazuna sand, which has a wide grain size distribution, and the specimens were subject to CT scanning during the loading process. A large number of CT images, both 2D cross sectional images and also 3D reconstruction images, were obtained from CT scanning. The first objective in this study was to develop a method of tracking soil particles using CT images and then to calculate their movement using this proposed method. The total number of soil particles depended on the relationship between the size of the soil particles and the resolution of the CT apparatus. Finally, the displacement vectors from these movements were calculated in three dimensions under the loading process and the distribution of the localized displacement in the sand was measured. It was confirmed that the combination of the tracking technique with CT images is effective for quantitative discussion on the results of X-ray CT. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Energy dissipated during the flow is evaluated from initial/residual potential energies and kinetic energy at the outlet of the flume. Though all parameters addressed here have measurable impact on the energy dissipation and the corresponding equivalent friction coefficient μ, it should be noted that the increase in fines content Fc up to a certain threshold tends to increase the equivalent friction coefficient μ. Beyond that threshold, the μ-value suddenly decreases due to a change in soil fabrics, transforming slow-speed granular flow to a high-speed mud flow. The evaluated μ-values for all tested cases have been found to be dependent on slope gradient. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Tsutsumi A., Tanaka H.	Combined effects of strain rate and temperature on consolidation behavior of clayey soils	2012	Soils and Foundations	52	2		207	215		1	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84870989443&partnerID=40&md5=88581c200039e3a8f815e8be39f5eb4c	Foundations Group, Geotechnical Engineering Field, Independent Administrative Institution, Japan; Division of Field Engineering for the Environment, Graduate School of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Japan	Tsutsumi, A., Foundations Group, Geotechnical Engineering Field, Independent Administrative Institution, Japan; Tanaka, H., Division of Field Engineering for the Environment, Graduate School of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Japan	It is considered that the long term settlement of clay deposits, known as secondary consolidation, is caused by clay viscosity. In this paper, the viscous property of clayey soils is examined from two viewpoints: one is temperature and the other is the effect of the strain rate. To investigate these effects, a special constant rate of strain (CRS) loading test, in which the strain rate is changed during the test, was carried out at temperatures of 10 and 50 °C on reconstituted clay samples. Under the normal strain rate, such as the order of 10-6 s-1, well-known temperature effects on the consolidation behavior were confirmed. That is, the high temperature condition leads to increased hydraulic conductivity due to the reduction in the viscosity of pore water at higher temperatures. It is also observed that the yield consolidation stress decreases with increasing temperature due to the viscous properties of soil skeletons. However, it is found that with higher temperature and smaller strain rates, the clay specimen does not follow conventional viscous behavior, like the Isotache model, but the gradient of stress-strain curve considerably decreases. The reason for different behavior from the Isotache model may be attributed to the creation of a new structure to resist the external deformation, under high temperature and a slow strain rate. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

A method of reinforcing saline soil with wheat straw and lime was investigated in this study. Specifically, the feasibility of using wheat straw treated with an SH (modified polyvinyl alcohol) agent as reinforcement and the compaction and strength of saline soil reinforced with wheat straw and lime were investigated. The results indicated that wheat straw treated with SH agent is suitable for use as a reinforced material owing to its higher corrosion resistance, tensile force and elongation. Additionally, reinforcement with wheat straw and lime was found to have a positive effect on the mechanical properties of soil. Reinforcement with wheat straw fiber enhanced the strength of soil during the early curing period and reduced the brittle failure problem associated with lime soil.

By introducing proper models dealing with the geometric and material nonlinearities of structures, the authors have proposed a numerical method for the modeling of the nonlinearity of soils that have been carefully investigated in past research, and also for the modeling of structures based on finite deformation schemes. The accuracy of the numerical analysis related to the structures was firstly verified with an Abaqus (2008) calculation. The calculation was conducted with a program named DBLEAVES (Ye, 2007, 2011). Furthermore, 2D soil-water coupled dynamic analyses, in the finite deformation schemes of both soils and structures, were conducted on a soil-group pile foundation-superstructure system to investigate the seismic behavior of an elevated bridge during a major earthquake, in which strong nonlinear behavior of geometry and material are expected for both the soils and the structures. The applicability of the proposed numerical method to soil-structure interaction problems encountered in many fields of geotechnical and structural engineering was carefully checked. The main purpose of the research is to propose a numerical method by which it is possible to describe the soil-structure interaction problems with a level of accuracy that can satisfy the needs of both the geotechnical and structural engineering fields. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Evaluation of shear strength and mechanical properties of granulated coal ash based on single particle strength	2012	Soils and Foundations	52	2		321	334			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84870992107&partnerID=40&md5=d1ea258cb72b1a4e9468f977c66462b5	Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Japan; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand; Ube Industries, Ltd., Yamaguchi, Japan	Yoshimoto, N., Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Japan; Hyodo, M., Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Japan; Nakata, Y., Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Japan; Orense, R.P., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand; Hongo, T., Ube Industries, Ltd., Yamaguchi, Japan; Ohnaka, A., Ube Industries, Ltd., Yamaguchi, Japan	The authors have been studying the mechanical properties of granulated coal ash formed by the milling process with a small amount of cement added, with particles almost equivalent in size to sand or fine gravel. The use of granulated coal ash has many advantages, such as the suppression of leaching of heavy metals and the possibility of outdoor curing. In addition, since granulated coal ash is produced artificially, their particle strength can be understood easily. Another advantage is that it is possible to control the particle strength, something which cannot be performed in natural sands. The present research was carried out in order to investigate the possibility of putting such advantages to good use. Single particle crushing tests were carried out on various kinds of granulated coal ash to evaluate the crushing characteristics of each individual grain. Also, the characteristics of the individual particle, such as shape, were investigated. Next, one-dimensional compression tests were conducted to investigate their compression characteristics. Finally, drained monotonic triaxial compression tests were performed under different confining pressures. The effects of the confining pressure on the shear characteristics, as well as their relation to shear strength, were examined with the single particle crushing strength taken into account. Contrary to observations in natural sands, the single particle crushing strength of granulated coal ash did not depend on particle size. Regarding compression characteristics, granulated coal ash compressed very easily because the crushing strength of a single particle was low. Therefore, the yield stress of granulated coal ash was found to be smaller than that of natural sands. Moreover, the crushing strength affected the shear characteristics, i.e., as the crushing strength increased, the shear stiffness became higher and the compressive volumetric strain became smaller. Therefore, crushing strength can be a useful parameter in evaluating the shear characteristic of granulated coal ash. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The volume change of sample during drying and wetting cycles in soil water retention test is obvious and non-ignorable, especially for soils with deformability. The soil water retention curve is generally superimposed with the volume change of soil specimens. However, in general, many apparatus that are used for soil water retention testing cannot measure the volume change during the test process. In this study, a modified experimental system, which can measure and record volume change during test, and also can control the entire testing process via computer, is proposed to determine the soil water retention curve. The new system has several advantages over existing apparatus. Notable amongst them is that it can automatically determine both the wetting and the drying characteristics with high accuracy, and can measure volume change during test, using only one sample.

Conventional earthquake designs have ensured stability within the conventional safety standards effective against small-to mid-scale seismic forces. Although such conventional stability checks are empirically thought to provide a sufficient margin of safety for highway bridge foundations, and even against larger earthquakes, this perception has not yet been thoroughly justified. CAESAR, at PWRI, has recently developed a new macro-element capable of expressing the seismic behavior of shallow foundations with reasonable accuracy. Accordingly, this paper presents a parametric study confirming the importance of conventional design criteria and computing the differences in the seismic permanent displacement of pier-shallow foundation systems by differentiating the values of safety factors incorporated in the conventional design criteria. Within the several conventional design parameters reviewed, this study finds that checks using the pseudo-static bearing capacity may not be as important as commonly assumed. © 2012.

To perform an elasto-plastic Finite Element (FE) analysis, it is important to accurately determine the initial stress conditions, and among them, the value of the coefficient of earth pressure at rest (K0 value) is particularly important. A K0-consolidation test using triaxial testing apparatus and a flat dilatometer were performed to investigate the K0 value for peat ground in Hokkaido, Japan. It was found that the K0 value for normally consolidated peat and organic clay (K 0NC) decreases with an increase in the ignition loss. The K 0 value for overconsolidated peat and organic clay (K0OC) is more strongly dependent on the over consolidation ratio (OCR) than that of usual inorganic clay. That is, it is known that K0OC is empirically related to K0NC, as expressed by K0OC=K 0NCOCRm, and in peat and organic clay the power of m increases with their ignition loss. An experimental equation to estimate K 0 using a flat dilatometer for peat ground is also proposed. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Rizzo Associates, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA 15235, United States; Zhu, F., Mott MacDonald Hong Kong Limited, Hong Kong, Hong Kong	The resultant force of lateral earth pressure is commonly used in the design of nearly vertical walls while flatter slopes are designed to be internally stable using a factor of safety approach. An unstable slope is considered to have an unsatisfactory factor of safety unless supported by internal and/or external measures. However, from an analytical viewpoint, the distinction between walls and unstable slopes is unnecessary. Using a limit equilibrium analysis combined with a log spiral surface, a previous formulation is extended to deal with the pseudostatic instability of simple, homogeneous, cohesionless slopes. Hence, the original approach by Mononobe-Okabe (M-O) is extended to yield the resultant lateral force needed to stabilize an unstable slope. Given the slope angle, the design internal angle of friction, the backslope, the surcharge, the vertical and horizontal seismic coefficients, and the inclination of the resultant force, one can calculate the magnitude of this resultant force. The approach allows for the selection of a rational inclination of the resultant for cases where soil-face interaction is likely to develop along vertical segments only. The approach generalizes Coulomb's (static) and M-O (pseudostatic) methods as all are in the same framework of limit equilibrium. While all methods yield identical results for vertical slopes, where the critical slip surface defining the active wedge degenerates to the same planar surface, the presented approach becomes more critical for flatter unstable slopes where the active wedge is augmented by a curved surface. Hence, the seamless extension of the M-O approach is produced. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A segmented tunnel is generally constructed as a watertight tunnel with a certain amount of allowable leakage. It has been reported that the leakage from watertight tunnels increases with time due to lining deterioration. The deterioration of joints and/or grouts in segmented linings changes the hydraulic boundary conditions, which results in long-term hydraulic and mechanical interaction, and consequently, an increase in leakage. In this paper, the coupled mechanical and hydraulic interaction between the segment lining and the surrounding ground is investigated using the numerical modeling method. It is identified that hydraulic deterioration causes significant changes in pore water pressure and structural behavior, and accelerates leakage. It is shown that design requirements for joint contact pressure are not sufficient for controlling long-term leakage, as they do not consider hydraulic deterioration. A strain requirement, controlling leakage, and a leakage evaluation method, considering hydraulic deterioration, are proposed in this paper. © 2012. The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

To decrease the objectionable influence of interference on the performance of the closely spaced footings, the foundation soil is reinforced by geogrid layers. The results of this reinforcement show both positive and negative effects, namely, a positive effect because there is a considerable increase in the ultimate bearing capacity, and a negative effect because there is an increase in settlement and tilt. Regarding the experimental results, the negative effect of interference can be decreased considerably through the use of soil reinforcements. The ultimate bearing capacity of the interfering footings increased by about 25-40%, whereas the settlement of the interfering footings at the ultimate load increased in the range of 60-100%. However, the closely spaced footings tilted by approximately 45% and 75% for reinforced sand with one and two layers of geogrid, respectively. © 2012. The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The earthquake was of magnitude 7.2 and hit a volcanic mountain area in Northern Japan. During the earthquake, the largest strong motion ever, over 4G, was recorded at the ground surface in the source region. As a result of the earthquake, a landslide of 1.5 million m 3 was generated near the top of the mountain and became a mud flow, traveling about 10 km downstream. The geomorphic characteristics of the mud flow are reported in this paper. Another huge landslide was generated upstream near the Aratosawa Dam. It was about 1 km in length, about 700 m in width and had a sliding mass volume of about 67 million m3, which slipped about 320 m. The geological features, the time series of the slide and the cause of the slide are also discussed. In addition, more than 50 landslide dams, formed due to the collapsed soil and rock, appeared after the earthquake. In this paper, the geotechnical properties of all the damage are introduced. © 2012. The Japanese Geotechnical Society. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of the intermediate loading histories, with and without large stress-amplitude unload/reload cycles, on the stress-strain properties of compacted cement-mixed well-graded gravelly soil, particularly the peak strength, were evaluated in multiple-step loading (ML) drained TC tests using a single specimen. A set of single-step loading (SL) tests at different σh′s were also performed. Similar specimens, prepared in the laboratory, were used for the tests in this study. Although the M-C failure envelope can be quite accurately determined by relevant ML tests, the peak strength may be underestimated if (a) TC loading is ceased far before the peak stress state or (b) TC reloading is started after the peak stress state has been passed at previous loading steps. Cases (a) and (b) may take place in both ML tests, with increasing and decreasing σ h′ while Case (b) may take place in ML tests with decreasing σh′ The reloading stress-strain relation at the intermediate stage in ML tests may become very soft due to the additional damage caused by a negative irreversible shear strain increment occurring in the immediately preceding unloading process. This effect gradually decreases during reloading, while it totally disappears once large-scale yielding has started, with essentially no effect on the peak strength. It is of the first priority to perform ML tests by increasing σh′ It is recommended that ML tests be performed by decreasing σh′ if possible, because the peak stress may be closely reached at some intermediate steps. An upper envelope of results from a pair of ML tests, with increasing and decreasing σh′ could be more representative of the true M-C failure envelope. © 2012. The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The reinforcement of these problematic soils with granular fill layers is one of the soil improvement techniques that are widely used. Problematic soil behaviour can be improved by totally or partially replacing the inadequate soils with layers of compacted granular fill. The study presented herein describes the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs), and the multi-linear regression model (MLR) to predict the bearing capacity of circular shallow footings supported by layers of compacted granular fill over natural clay soil. The data used in running the network models have been obtained from an extensive series of field tests, including large-scale footing diameters. The field tests were performed using seven different footing diameters, up to 0.90 m, and three different granular fill layer thicknesses. The results indicate that the use of granular fill layers over natural clay soil has a considerable effect on the bearing capacity characteristics and that the ANN model serves as a simple and reliable tool for predicting the bearing capacity of circular footings in stabilized natural clay soil. © 2012.

The current Japanese method of computing tensile loads in the reinforcement strips is based on the Coherent Gravity Method first developed in France more than three decades ago. At that time, the method was calibrated against measured loads from seven instrumented structures based on soil friction angles in the range of 35-46°. In Japan, however, there are many reinforced soil walls that have been built successfully using cohesive-frictional soils with fines contents as high as 35% and lower friction angles. The present paper uses the results of load measurements from 18 instrumented wall sections, reported previously in the literature, and nine instrumented Japanese walls to examine the prediction accuracy of the Coherent Gravity Method described in the Public Works Research Center (2003) guidelines. The current design chart for the coefficients of earth pressure, used to compute tensile reinforcement loads, is empirically adjusted for soil backfills falling into three different friction angle ranges. The new design chart is calibrated to satisfy an average load exceedance level that matches the value adopted when the Coherent Gravity Method was first calibrated. © 2012.

In conducting the centrifuge tests, the performance of the instrumentation applied to measure the pressure from granular soils was critically assessed. At non-dynamic states, the backfill confined between the quay wall and the rigidly stabilised soil block exerted smaller earth pressure at deeper locations, at both apparently active and transient states. The calculation, based on perfect plasticity and considering friction arching, was useful in explaining these results. A similar feature was also observed during the steady-state oscillations, in the case of dry sand backfill, and was associated with the system's increased seismic stability. In underwater cases, the pore water fluctuations in the backfill dominated the total earth pressure behaviour, with the active pressure being smaller again from a confined fill than from a fully extending one. Despite the reduced active pressure, placing the stabilised soil in the proximity of the quay wall increased the wall's permanent seaward movement, unless the two bodies were in direct contact. This ostensible association of smaller active pressure with greater instability in the underwater cases cannot be explained by the conventional, simplified conception of the active earth pressure as a unilateral cause of instability. The evaluation of such unconventional backfill conditions seems to require rigorous consideration of the simultaneous soil-water-structure interactions. © 2012. The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Once a peatland is drained, however, it is transformed into a carbon source, since better aerated conditions promote the aerobic microbial decomposition of the peat soil layers. Since the aerobic depth should depend on the balance between the capability of the peat layers to transport the O2 and the intensity of the O2 consumption by aerobic microbes, our aim in the present study was to characterize the soil gas diffusivity (Ds/D 0) and the soil water retention curves (SWRCs) of two types of peat soils found in sub-boreal and tropical peatlands. We also numerically simulated the effects of Ds/D0 and SWRCs on the aerobic depth into which the atmospheric O2 can penetrate in unsaturated peat layers with various groundwater table levels. For the numerical simulations, we modified the Millington-Quirk-type Ds/D0 model, while the O2 consumptive behavior in the peat layers was described by the Monod-type equation. The Ds/D0, as a function of the air-filled porosity, was consistently larger for the tropical-peat samples than for the sub-boreal ones, implying that the tropical-peat samples had less tortuous pore geometry than the sub-boreal ones. However, the features of the SWRCs indicated that the tropical-peat samples showed higher water retentivity than the sub-boreal ones; and therefore, lowering the groundwater table would not raise the air-illed porosity of the tropical-peat samples more than that of the sub-boreal ones. Through numerical simulations contrasting the features of the Ds/D0 and the SWRC curves for the tropical-peat samples with those of the sub-boreal ones, unsaturated anaerobic layers were seen to form more easily in the simulations representing the tropical-peat samples than in those representing the sub-boreal ones, suggesting high water retentivity. In turn, the dificulty in aeration inhibited the gaseous diffusion in the tropical-peat soils even though the Ds/D0 values for the tropical-peat samples were higher than those for the sub-boreal ones for a series of air-illed porosity. Furthermore, the development of unsaturated anaerobic layers caused a ceiling for the increase in the surface CO2 emission rate associated with the fall in the groundwater table. © 2012.

The granular fill has been modeled as a Pasternak shear layer, while the naturally occurring saturated soft soil has been idealized by a Kelvin-Voigt model and the stone columns by Winkler springs. The nonlinear behavior of the granular ill, the stone columns and the soft soil has been represented by hyperbolic constitutive relationships. The governing differential equations of the soil-foundation system have been derived and presented in a non-dimensional form. These equations have been solved using appropriate boundary conditions by means of an iterative Gauss-Siedel technique. A detailed parametric study has been conducted to investigate the influence of various parameters, such as the magnitude and the velocity of the applied load, viscous damping, the diameter and the spacing of the stone columns, the ultimate resistance of the soft soil and the stone columns, the relative stiffness of the stone columns and the average degree of consolidation on the response of the soil-foundation system. All these parameters have been found to significantly influence the response of the infinite beam. However, the ultimate shear resistance of the granular ill has been found to have a negligible effect on the response of the system. © 2012. The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Axial bearing capacity of socketed single cast-in-place piles	2012	Soils and Foundations	52	1		59	68			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84871274574&partnerID=40&md5=7589823809b59f09640ec98a262d41e8	Yildiz Technical University, Civil Engineering Department, Davutpaşa, Esenler, 34220 Istanbul, Turkey	Akgüner, C., Yildiz Technical University, Civil Engineering Department, Davutpaşa, Esenler, 34220 Istanbul, Turkey; Kirkit, M., Yildiz Technical University, Civil Engineering Department, Davutpaşa, Esenler, 34220 Istanbul, Turkey	In this paper, a comparison is made of the axial bearing capacities estimated with pile load tests and empirical methods for seven rock-socketed single cast-in-place piles constructed in Turkey. The unconfined compressive strength of rock, obtained from pressuremeter tests, is used in the empirical correlations. It is commonly assumed that axial loads applied at the top of a socketed pile are transferred to the sides of the socket until a certain displacement is reached and that the end bearing capacity contributes only after this threshold displacement is exceeded. In practice, however, due to typically small displacements occurring in rock sockets, most, if not all, of the axial capacity is estimated to derive from the side shear. The limit displacement up to which the side frictional capacity of a socketed pile governs and the end bearing capacity starts mobilizing is examined, and no such threshold value is observed based on the findings of this study. Nevertheless, the bearing capacities obtained from the empirical correlations agree reasonably well with those calculated from pile load tests, when a systematic approach for estimating the threshold value from pile load tests is utilized and the unconfined compressive strength of socketed rocks can be estimated within reasonable accuracy applying actual field conditions. © 2012.

The ground consists of alluvial sandy layers and soft clay deposits, which have been locally improved by several methods, including deep mixing beneath the conventional levee and the combination of sand drains and sand compaction piles under the extended back slope. A long-term consolidation analysis of this super levee construction is carried out using an elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model. The layered construction procedure is applied to properly simulate the construction sequence of the super levee. The effects of the structural degradation and the strain dependency of the shear modulus, as two aspects of destructuration in clay materials, are studied in terms of the consolidation behavior for the unimproved case. For the improved case, the analysis is implemented by including the ground-improved zones in the finite element simulation. The field observation data obtained during the preloading process, before the construction of the super levee, are employed to verify the assumptions and to calibrate the material properties of the improved layers. The effects of destructuration in the natural ground cases are observed as excess pore pressure build-up after construction and strain localization. The effects of ground improvement techniques are studied through a comparison of the deformation results and the excess pore water pressure responses with the natural ground cases. The numerical results show that it is important to carefully estimate the unequal long-term settlement for the construction of large-scale embankments. © 2012. The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The spatial correlation is introduced among the settlement model parameters, and the settlements at various points are spatially correlated through these geotechnical parameters, which naturally describe the phenomenon. The method is based on Bayesian estimations, considering both prior information, including spatial correlation, and observed settlements, to search for the best estimates of the parameters. Within the Bayesian framework, the optimized selection of the auto-correlation distance, by Akaike's Bayesian Information Criterion (ABIC), and the spatial interpolation of the model parameters, by the kriging method, are also proposed. The application of the proposed approach in secondary compression settlement predictions, based on the linear relationship between settlement and the logarithm of time, is presented in this paper. Several case studies are carried out using both simulated settlement data and actual field observation data. It is concluded that the accuracy of settlement predictions can be improved by taking into account the spatial correlation structure, especially when the spacing of the observation points is shorter than half of the auto-correlation distance, and that the proposed approach produces rational predictions of settlements at any location and at any time with quantified errors. © 2012.

All tests are performed in a fully automated true triaxial testing apparatus. The relative magnitude of the intermediate principal stress, expressed in terms of the b-value, and initial cross-anisotropy show significant influence on the stress-strain, strength, and shear band formation characteristics of the clay. Shear bands form and appear to cause failure in all true triaxial tests performed, except in triaxial compression. The initiation and development of shear bands is observed to take place, when the clay undergoes volumetric contraction. The lower strength exhibited in the shear bands is caused by alignment of the clay particles.

The concept of an equivalent void ratio is most useful when the grain size distribution of the sand/silt mixture is similar to that of binary packing. Due to its grain characteristics and the wide range of compressibility when the fines content changes, correlating the cyclic strength to fines content via the equivalent void ratio for Mai Liao Sand (MLS) is not a straightforward procedure. Earlier studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of relating cyclic strength to state parameters for sands. Using a series of cyclic triaxial test results as a database, the authors demonstrated the effectiveness of relating cyclic strength to fines contents (fc) through a state parameter for MLS with an fc ranging from 0 to 30%that takes advantage of the equivalent void ratio. In addition to the density and stress states, the state parameter based correlations indirectly reflect the effects of soil grain characteristics. The drawback of requiring a separate critical state line when f c changes can be circumvented by using a united critical state line based on the equivalent void ratio.

Ltd., Japan	In this research, under various conditions, we evaluate the water cut-off performance of H-jointed steel pipe sheet piles (SPSPs) with the H-H joints attaching water-swelling materials which are components of SPSPs for water cut-off in a coastal waste landfill site. Specifically, we research the water cut-off performance when these H-H joints have foreign particles, when they are in a wet-dry cyclic condition, and when the water-swelling material has deteriorated. As a result of this research, it has been found that in any of the above cases, H-jointed SPSPs with H-H joints attaching water-swelling materials are capable of providing water cut-off performance, and meet seepage control work standards as long as they are under less than certain pressure levels to be considered in coastal waste landfill sites. Also, it has been proved that the above conditions do not affect the water cut-off performance of H-jointed SPSPs with H-H joints attaching water-swelling materials.

Results are reported for an aqueous solution of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX). The partitioning coeffcient obtained from sorption/immersion test is shown to be effectively the same as that from desorption test. Both conventional untreated (HDPE) and fluorinated (f-HDPE) geomembranes are examined and it is shown that a fluorinated layer on the surface of an HDPE geomembrane increases its resistance to the permeation of BTEX penetrants by about a factor of 2.4 at 229C and 1.8 at 69C. An Arrhenius relationship is developed that could be used for estimating hydrocarbon permeation at different temperatures between 69C and 229C for both the HDPE and f-HDPE geomembranes examined.

Attention is paid to the modeling of permeability for Pleistocene sand gravel layers considering the sedimentation environment because the performance of excess pore water pressure is strongly dependent on the extent of distribution as well as the change of thickness of those permeable sand gravel layers. The concept of ̀̀mass permeability is introduced to model the actual process of dissipation of excess pore water pressure in the field. The mechanism for the propagation of excess pore water pressure is also discussed. Special attention is given to the modeling of the compressibility of the highly structured Pleistocene clay layers, exhibiting already significant visco-plastic deformations even in the quasi-overconsolidated effective stress range. The present numerical analyses are found to describe the large and long-term settlement together with the slow dissipation of excess pore water pressure in the Pleistocene clay and sand gravel layers that actually has taken place in the field.

In the present paper, this one-dimensional model is extended to describe not only the soil features explained in the related paper three-dimensionally (3D), but also to explain other soil features found in multi-dimensional conditions, such as shear behavior considering the influence of intermediate principal stress on the deformation and strength of soils, and the positive and negative soil dilatancy. Firstly, the first step in extending any kind of one-dimensional model to a three-dimensional one is explained in detail: the significance of tij concept and its stress invariants (tN and tS) is explained and compared with the idea of ordinary stress invariants (p and q) used in the Cam clay model. Then, the advanced elastoplastic relations (stages I to III) in the one-dimensional condition presented in the related paper are re-formulated as three-dimensional models-e.g., a model for over consolidated soil, a model for structured soil and a model which considers time-dependent behavior. The three-dimensional models for over consolidated soil (stage I) and structured soil (stage II) are formulated so as to coincide with the subloading tij model developed by Nakai and Hinokio (2004) and by Nakai (2007), respectively. The validity of the models in stage I and stage II is checked by simulations of various shear tests for sands with different void ratios and for over consolidated and natural clays under drained and undrained conditions. The model in stage III is verified by simulations of shear tests with different strain rates, and by simulating creep tests and others, not only for normally consolidated clay but also for non-structured and structured over consolidated clays under drained and undrained conditions.

The elastoplastic behavior of over consolidated non-structured soils under a one-dimensional stress condition is firstly presented by introducing a state variable that represents the influence of density (stage I). To describe the one-dimensional stress-strain behavior of structured soils, attention is focused on density and bonding as the main factors that affect the response of this type of soil, because it can be considered that soil a skeleton structure which is in a looser state than that of a normally consolidated soil is formed by bonding effects (stage II). Furthermore, a simple method is presented which allows for other soil characteristics to be considered, such as time and temperature dependency, and the effect of suction in unsaturated soils. Experimental observations show that the normally consolidated line (NCL) in the void ratio-stress relation (e.g., e-ln s curve) shifts depending on the change of strain rate, temperature, suction and others (stage III). The validation of the model at stages I and II is demonstrated by simulating one-dimensional consolidation tests for normally consolidated, over consolidated and natural clays. The applicability of the model at stage III is verified not only by the simulations of time-dependent behavior of clays in one-dimensional element tests but also by the soil-water coupled finite element analysis of oedometer tests as a boundary value problem. The extension from one-dimensional models to three-dimensional models is easily achieved by defining the yield function using stress invariants instead of one-dimensional stress 'σ' and by assuming an appropriate flow rule in stress space. The details of the modeling in general three-dimensional stress conditions will be described in another paper (Nakai et al., 2011).

As such, it is essential to find an alternative way to reduce the quantities of this waste material to avoid environmental problems and the high cost of disposal in landfill. This paper describes a case study focused on the use of recycled gypsum, which is derived from gypsum waste plasterboard, to improve the strength of soft clay soil for embankment construction projects taken in consideration environmental impacts. Four different recycled gypsum contents ranging from 0 to 10% was investigated. Two different types of cements-Portland and Furnace slag type B-with a content ranging from 0 to 3z was used to develop solidification for recycled gypsum and improve environmental properties. For this purpose, a series of unconfined compression tests were conducted to evaluate strength performance of treated clay. While a series of environmental tests were conducted to explore the solubility concentration of fluorine, boron, and hexavalent chromium in the untreated and treated soil specimens. Furthermore, hydrogen sulfide and pH were investigated. Results showed that compressive strength and unit weight of treated clay soil increased with the increase of recycled gypsum content. The strength obtained in the field for treated soil with recycled gypsum was found to be greater than that obtained in the laboratory. The early curing days for soil-gypsum mixture had a significant effect on strength performance compared to the later days. The additives of recycled gypsum for tested soil swiftly increased the strength. This is a vital property for improvement embankment tracability that helps to reduce the construction time and cost. The use of recycled gypsum within the investigated limits had no adverse effect on pH value and hydrogen sulfide gas was found to be less than the standard permitted limits. As well, the solubility concentrations for fluorine, boron, and hexavalent chromium were found within the permitted standard limits in Japan. The curing time had a significant effect on the reduction the release of harmful substance elements investigated. Furnace cement type B had the potential to improve the mechanical and environmental functions for soil-gypsum mixture. It is recommended that Furnace cement type B be used as a solidification agent for soil treated with recycled gypsum because it has low cost and it is more environmentally friendly than Portland cement.

In this study, the numerical prediction is performed with a dynamic three-phase (soil, water and air) coupled analysis based on porous media theory and constitutive models. The weak forms of three governing equations, momentum balance equations of the overall three-phase material and mass and the momentum balance equations of the pore fluids (water and air), are implemented in a finite element model. The discretized equations are solved by the fully implicit method and the skeleton stress is also implicitly integrated. The in-situ observation at the target fill slope of the case study has been ongoing since 2006. First, distributions of water saturation in the fill slope are simulated by performing seepage analyses to reproduce the in-situ ground water level in the fill slope. Second, seismic responses of the fill slope during two past earthquakes are simulated, and the numerical method is validated by comparing observed acceleration records and numerical one. Finally, seismic responses of the fill slope during a future scenario earthquake are predicted under different moisture conditions of unsaturated fill. As a result, the following findings were obtained. 1) The shape of the ground water level was partially reproduced from the quite dry fill slope element by using virtual constant precipitation. However, the observation results of moisture distribution above the ground water level were not reproduced. 2) In the validation analyses after two earthquakes, the numerical method reproduced the positions of peak frequency of acceleration Fourier spectra. 3) The numerical results clearly showed that frequency characteristics of the seismic response and the residual displacement of the fill slope were affected by the initial distribution of the degree of saturation in the fill ground.

The objectives of a series of tests are to study the mechanism of the uplift and to obtain relationships among uplift displacement and factors affecting the uplift. The factors considered in the experiments are the ground water levels, the magnitude of input accelerations, the duration time of shaking, the relative densities of trench backfill and the native ground, the material of native ground, the volume of a trench, the apparent unit weight of a manhole, and the contact conditions at the bottom of a manhole. Test results show that the primary cause of uplift is the reduction of the effective confining stress near the bottom of a manhole due to strong shaking. The magnitude of uplift is found to be strongly correlated with the ground water depth, the intensity of shaking, the shear deformation of the trench, and the contact conditions at the bottom of the manhole. These findings are believed to be useful for engineering practice in the mitigation of the manhole uplift.

The authors had been involved in a research project to monitor the long-lasting change of the landslide mass at regular 6 monthly intervals since June 2008, and they noticed that air-exposed pieces of sandstones and mudstones of the landslide mass had disintegrated and crumbled due to slaking that dated back to the breach. The change in the landslide mass shape observed between June 2008 and November 2009, did not seem so significant except for a 300 m-long gulley that appeared all of a sudden at the toe of the mass during winter time from 2008 to 2009. Displacements from GPS-measurements conducted in June and November 2009 showed that the crest part subsided by about 10 cm while the toe part heaved slightly up where the overflowed water fell into the eroded gully. A field survey was conducted over the breached landslide dam in April 2010, two months after the breaching event. A severely eroded breach channel was observed along the spillway, which was excavated immediately after the formation of the dam. Given the chronological change in precipitation of the catchment area of Hattian Bala obtained from the TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) satellite data, the dam is considered to have been breached due to the overtopping of water over the landslide mass of slakable nature. The slakable nature of the material is discussed through both standard slaking tests and advanced unconventional direct shear tests on prepared specimens. Significant creep deformation and a reduction in their peak strength were observed as the slaking developed in the specimens, suggesting that the slakable nature of the mudstones might have been responsible for the breach of the landslide dam.

Bias statistics are computed from measured loads from instrumented MAWstructures and in-situ anchor load tests. Two different load models and two different plate load capacity equations are used in the calibrations. A load factor of gQ=2.25 is recommended to meet a 3z load exceedance criterion using a new load model by the writers which increases to 3.00 if the current approach recommended by PWRC (2002) is used. A target probability of failure Pf=1z is used in calibrations and is judged to be a reasonable value for the highly load-redundant MAW systems. Resistance factors of 0.80 and 0.95 are recommended for anchor plate and anchor rod rupture limit states using the new load and resistance models proposed by the writers. While the paper is focused on one particular wall system, the reliability-based limit states design calibration approach described in the paper provides an instructive template for limit states calibration of other reinforced soil retaining wall systems in Japan.

In addition, there has been strong demand for the development of an international-flight network. Consequently, a new runway, called the D-runway, was planned and constructed from March 2007 to October 2010. Because some of the D-runway runs through a river mouth, a hybrid structure consisting of piled pier and reclamation fill was adopted. To overcome the geotechnical difficulties in constructing this hybrid structure on the soft clay deposit, various technologies in design and construction were adopted. This paper provides an outline of the project, the ground investigation, and the design of the D-runway structure from a geotechnical engineering view point. From the results of the site investigation, the stratigraphic model at the site was clarified. For the clay layers, a representative depth-profile for each soil parameter was determined. Some local soil properties which tended to be overlooked when only employing an engineering point of view can be appropriately captured by linking the geological and geotechnical information. In the construction of the D-runway, not only the ground improvement technologies (SD, SCP, and CDM) but also the new developed construction materials (the pneumatic mixing of cement treated soil and air-foam treated lightweight soil) were utilized. In the-D-runway project, various technologies used in previous airport constructions were brought together and applied to the ground investigation, design, construction work, and even maintenance. The construction of the D-runway was completed safely, rapidly, and economically, and it came into use on 21 October 2010, on schedule.

Previously, the kriging method was used in geotechnical engineering for modeling the spatial variability of soil properties. In this paper, we illustrate a first-order reliability analysis method based on a kriging approximation of the deterministic numerical model. The key idea in this method is to first calibrate a kriging model to approximate the deterministic numerical model, and then to evaluate the failure probability based on the kriging model. As any stand-alone software for deterministic geotechnical numerical analysis can be potentially used to generate samples for calibrating a kriging model, it can then be ultimately used for a reliability analysis. As such, this method provides a practical way for practitioners to perform reliability analysis based on existing deterministic geotechnical software. The effectiveness of the suggested method is illustrated through a pile foundation example, a shallow foundation example, and a slope example in which the performance functions do not have explicit forms. The kriging method is used here as a tool for interpolating and approximating deterministic numerical models. The present paper does not address any type of spatial variation of soil properties.

The surrounding ground's stress changes induced by grout injection are considered to be an important cause for the stabilisation effects, along with some densification of the ground in the bulb's vicinity. The present study investigates characteristics of the stress changes by simulating compaction grouting processes in a geotechnical centrifuge. Detailed descriptions are given of apparatus and experimental techniques specifically developed for conducting miniature injection tests. The observed increases in the horizontal stresses, evaluated in terms of the earth pressure coeffcient, K, reflected the influence of grout pile spacing, and were found to be consistent with field measurements except near the surface. The centrifuge tests also allowed the changes in the dominant stress direction within the horizontal planes at the stabilised domain's centre to be evaluated, with the results indicating the dependency of the stress changes upon depth and interactions between neighboring grout piles. The significance of the stress changes in increasing the liquefaction resistance is demonstrated by mapping liquefaction curves against initial stress states through a series of cyclic hollow cylinder simple shear tests.

Navier/CERMES, France; Qian, L.-X., Tongji University, China; Ye, W.-M., Tongji University, China; Chen, B., Tongji University, China	The THM behavior of compacted GMZ bentonite has been investigated using a suction-temperature controlled isotropic cell. The results obtained were compared with the existing results on other reference bentonites (MX80, FEBEX, FoCa, and Kunigel-V1). It has been observed that the coeffcient of thermal expansion of the compacted GMZ bentonite is 2×10 -40C -1, similar to the values of compacted MX80 and FEBEX bentonites. The heating tests of the GMZ bentonite also show that the suction is an important parameter that governs the thermal volumetric behavior of unsaturated soils. Unlike temperature, suction has a significant effect on the compressibility parameters. Examination of the mineralogy of various bentonites showed that a good correlation can be generally established between the montmorillonite content and the cations exchange capacity (CEC) or the specific surface area (S). Nevertheless, both the basic geotechnical properties and the swelling potential seem to depend not only on the montmorillonite content but also on other factors such as the nature of base exchangeable cations. The quartz content of the GMZ bentonite is relatively high (11.7z). This could explain its relatively large values of thermal conductivity.

In the tests, both creep deformation and collapse deformation due to wetting were allowed to take place at various fixed stress states during otherwise monotonic loading at a fixed strain rate. Combined effects of the viscous property and wetting on the stress-strain behaviour observed during 1-D compression were described by incorporating the wetting effects into a non-linear three-component elasto-viscoplastic model (a 3C model). Based on the experimental results, the effects of wetting on the inviscid stress and the irreversible strain relation of the plastic component of the 3C model and the property of the viscous component, having an Isotach property, are formulated as a function of the degree of saturation. Complicated rate- and time-dependent stress-strain behaviour observed during saturation at a fixed stress state and subsequent monotonic loading at a constant strain rate were successfully simulated.

An in-flight excavation device was realized to simulate the live excavation of slopes at high g levels during centrifuge model tests. A series of centrifuge model tests was conducted to simulate the excavation of a slope at different inclinations and heights, and the effect of the excavation size was taken into consideration. The displacement histories of points over the slope were measured by an image capture and displacement measurement system. Measurement results showed that the excavation-induced deformation process could be divided into several phases with different displacement distribution features. The excavation was found to only affect a restricted zone of the slope whose boundary could be outlined by an A-surface. A strain analysis was conducted to determine the excavation-induced strain localization area of the slope. The degree of strain localization increased as the excavation time increased, but the width of the strain localization area was nearly invariable. Shear failure first occurred near the excavation surface and then extended upwardly to the slope surface under excavation conditions, while tension failure played a dominant role in the upper part of the slip surface. The strain localization area moved towards the slope surface with an increasing slope inclination. The lower part of the final slip surface was located in the strain localization area.

Measured anchor plate capacities from full-scale in situ load tests reported in the literature are compared to predicted values using the analytical model recommended in Japan. A modified anchor capacity model is proposed that preserves the general form of the PWRC equation, but introduces correction factors to improve accuracy. The correction factors are empirically-based and are selected by back- fitting measured loads to achieve a resistance bias mean equal to one and a low coefficient of variation (COV) in bias values. The results of a large number of small-scale anchor capacity tests carried out in pullout boxes were used to guide the selection of back-fitted parameters. The correction factors account for the influence of the confining pressure (anchor depth), the plate size and the anchor rod length on the anchor plate capacity. New N c and N q factors are also presented as part of the new model. The bias statistics for the two models comprise an important contribution to future reliability-based calibrations of the ultimate anchor capacity limit state for MAW systems in Japan.

The new device is called the Akbar Pressuremeter (APMT). This paper is based on the APMT testing of a cohesive soil deposit comprised of low plastic lean clay (CL) to sandy silty clay (CL-ML). The APMT testing, using a full-displacement technique, standard penetration tests and undisturbed samples, was carried out at two locations. The soil strength and type were determined using the undisturbed samples. The applied pressure-cavity strain curves of the APMT tests performed at different levels were analysed to determine soil strength and stiffness. The undrained shear strength of the undisturbed samples was determined in the laboratory by unconfined compression tests. This paper provides a comparison of the parameters interpreted from the pressuremeter and those determined from other field and laboratory methods.

This method, based on the Beer-Lambert Law of transmissivity, determines the saturation of water (S w) and LNAPLs (S o) by comparing the average optical densities (D i) for each matrix element of the tested domain to the corresponding average optical densities for three base pictures of the same domain taken with two digital cameras attached to two different band-pass filters (λ = 450 nm and 640 nm). Two equations with two unknowns (S w and S o) are defined for each mesh element, which enables the saturation distribution to be calculated under dynamic conditions. The three base conditions for the domain are: (i) fully saturated with water (D i 10), (ii) fully saturated with LNAPL (D i 01), and (iii) completely dry (D i 00). The Simplified Image Analysis Method was then applied to analyze the behavior of two fluctuating groundwater systems, namely, two-phase air-water and three-phase air-water-LNAPL, in a one-dimensional column, 3.5 × 3.5 × 50 cm, filled with Toyoura sand. The mass balance of the drainage-imbibition three-phase airwater-LNAPL system showed a difference of just 4.7% in LNAPL, demonstrating that this non-intrusive and non-destructive method is reliable for providing water and LNAPL saturation distributions throughout the domain when studying the effects of porous soil contamination by LNAPLs subjected to dynamic conditions.

In this study, the empirical relationships among three particle shape indices, different fractal dimension definitions, and internal friction angles were investigated. Within this context, direct shear tests were conducted on 38 different types of sands from different origins and with various grain sizes. For each type of sand, image analyses were performed to find out the roundness, sphericity, regularity parameters belonging to individual grains. Additionally, several statistics of these parameters for different types of sands were determined. The results revealed that particle shape has a limited effect on the friction angle of sands in comparison to grain size distribution. Furthermore, it was found that decreasing regularity in particle shape caused an increase in the internal friction angle of uniform sands. These findings agree with the empirical relationship between the internal friction angle and particle shape suggested in the literature.

Among them, a dip slope containing a weak layer in Yamakoshi Village (currently Nagaoka City) was investigated intensively. Regarding its morphological characteristics, it is argued that the earthquake reactivated a pre-existing failure plane which then formed most of the present sliding plane. In order to reveal the strength properties of the weak layer that formed the sliding plane, including the behavior against cyclic loading, a series of triaxial compression tests and simple shear tests was performed on undisturbed specimens that were retrieved by block sampling from the site. Based on the test results, a stability analysis and the calculation of the earthquake-induced displacement were performed. By extending Newmark's sliding block analysis, while considering the effects of the irregular geometry of the sliding plane and its strainsoftening properties, a reasonable simulation of the process of this slope failure could be provided.

Effective stress change and post-earthquake settlement properties of granular materials subjected to multi-directional cyclic simple shear	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	5		873	884		2	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84866918873&partnerID=40&md5=b72802ed4560b2ee1914633c0717fd9a	Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Japan; Department of Brawijaya University, Indonesia	Matsuda, H., Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Japan; Hendrawan, A.P., Department of Brawijaya University, Indonesia; Ishikura, R., Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Japan; Kawahara, S., Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Japan	In order to investigate the effect of cyclic shear direction on the properties of saturated granular materials, such as effective vertical stress reduction and post-earthquake settlement, several series of multi-directional cyclic simple shear tests under constant volume conditions are performed on Toyoura sand and granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS), as an alternative material. The GBFS has particular properties such as light weight, high shear strength and high permeability, and it is considered to be one of the most promising materials in geotechnical engineering. From the test results, it is clarified that the shear strain amplitude has a significant effect on the changes in the effective stress of granular materials. However, at higher levels of shear strain amplitude, the cyclic shear direction has little influence on the effective stress reduction. It is found that the vertical strain, after the cyclic shearing of the GBFS samples, was lower than that of the Toyoura sand under the same test conditions. Finally, to evaluate the changes in effective stress under uni-directional and multi-directional cyclic simple shear conditions, an estimation method is represented by a function of cumulative shear strain G* and resultant shear strain Γ. The validity of this proposed model is confirmed by comparing the experimental and the calculated data obtained under multi-directional cyclic simple shear conditions.

The particle characteristics were examined for samples taken to pre- and post- yield states in compression as well as after shearing to high strains. The change to particle characteristics such as surface roughness, shape and size due to loading were examined. The results show that although catastrophic particle breakage starts with the yielding of the material, changes to the particle surfaces at contacts, through minor damage to particle asperities by yielding or chipping, can impose some local changes even before reaching the yield stress. The study also confirmed the importance of the sample initial grading on defining the mode of particle interaction during compression.

Push-up load tests on the dry silica sand plugs inside a model pipe pile and DEM simulations were carried out to investigate the plugging behaviour. The influences of the packing state of the soil plugs (the relative density), and the height of the plugs on the bearing capacity were investigated. Prior to the pushup load tests, element tests on the silica sand and DEM analyses were performed to characterise the silica sand and to determine suitable DEM analysis parameters. The experimental and DEM results clearly show that the push-up force increases significantly with the increase in the aspect ratio of the soil plug, H/D, and with the relative density of the soil plug. The DEM analyses show a good agreement with the experimental results when the push-up force is small. Furthermore, the DEM results reveal that only the density of the soil plug in the lower portion, adjacent to the pile tip, increases gradually with the increase in the push-up displacement as well as the increase in H/D. Hence, it is the lower portion of the soil plug that mainly controls the capacity of the soil plug.

Properties of cement-treated soils during initial curing stages	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	5		775	784		1	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84866935514&partnerID=40&md5=ef4e6f12f248b698ad2499a75fe9ce29	Hokkaido University, Japan	Seng, S., Hokkaido University, Japan; Tanaka, H., Hokkaido University, Japan	The engineering properties of cement-treated soils manufactured by the so-called Pipe Mixing Method and Super GeoMaterial (SGM) Method were studied. In these methods, clayey soils with high water contents are mixed with cement and used as fill material. Since the cement-mixed soils are transported through a pipeline, whose length at times exceeds 2 km, the properties of the treated soil during the initial stages of the hardening process are important. Bender element, vane shear and fall cone tests were performed to obtain such engineering properties as the shear modulus and the shear strength. The study revealed the following: 1) The minimum shear wave velocity of treated soils is detectable at around 2.8 m/s, corresponding to a shear modulus of about 12 kPa. 2) A linear correlation between the shear modulus and the shear strength exists even in the very early stages of curing, approximately G = 300 s, where G and s are the shear modulus and the shear strength, respectively. This relation is similar to that for natural clays. 3) The setting time observed for concrete is also apparent in cement-treated soil materials. 4) Fall cone tests comprise a useful and simple technique for measuring very low levels of shear strength.

Experimental investigation of laterally loaded piles in sand under multilayered conditions	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	5		915	927		1	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84866928126&partnerID=40&md5=80b489529a32db3c1d798ba0110ce791	School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, South Korea; Geotechnical Engineering Division, Korea Institute of Construction Technology, South Korea	Lee, J., School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, South Korea; Kyung, D., School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, South Korea; Hong, J., School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, South Korea; Kim, D., Geotechnical Engineering Division, Korea Institute of Construction Technology, South Korea	In the present study, the lateral load responses and the lateral load capacities of piles in sand under multilayered conditions were investigated. For this purpose, a series of lateral load tests using two model piles was conducted within a calibration chamber under various multilayered soil conditions. The test results were then compared with those obtained under uniform soil conditions. Using the test results, the effect of the multilayered soil conditions on the design components for laterally loaded piles, such as the pile rotation point, the ultimate lateral load capacity, and the lateral soil pressure profile, were analyzed. It was found that the lateral load responses of piles are largely affected by the soil conditions near the surface and the pile base, while the effect of the conditions in the middle-depth layers is relatively small. It was also observed that the depth to the pile rotation point fluctuates during the initial loading, but then becomes stabilized as the level of the load is increased. No significant difference in the depths to the pile rotation point was observed between the uniform and the multilayered soil conditions. Based on the test results in this study, a modi- fied lateral pressure profile, applicable to the estimation of lateral pile load capacities, was proposed to more realistically reflect the effect of multilayered soil conditions.

Izawa J., Kuwano J.	Evaluation of extent of damage to geogrid reinforced soil walls subjected to earthquakes	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	5		945	958			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84866947442&partnerID=40&md5=44adcd80b2987c2d3266f1f47b1c3fd3	Earthquake and Structural Engineering Laboratory, Structures Technology Division, Railway Technical Research Institute, Japan; Geosphere Research Institute, Saitama University, Japan	Izawa, J., Earthquake and Structural Engineering Laboratory, Structures Technology Division, Railway Technical Research Institute, Japan; Kuwano, J., Geosphere Research Institute, Saitama University, Japan	The aim of this study is to establish a simple method for evaluating the extent of damage to geogrid reinforced soil walls (GRSWs) subjected to earthquakes. Centrifuge tilting and shaking table tests were conducted to investigate the seismic behaviour of GRSWs, with special focus on the effects of the tensile stiffness of the geogrids, the pullout characteristics and the backfill materials. As a result, it was found that GRSWs showed large shear deformation in the reinforced area after shaking, that such deformation was influenced by the tensile stiffness of the geogrids, the pullout resistance and the deformation modulus of the backfill material, and that finally slip lines appeared. However, the GRSWs maintained adequate seismic stability owing to the pullout resistance of the geogrids, even after the formation of slip lines. It is considered that such slip lines appeared due to the failure of the backfill material. Since the maximum shear strain occurring in the backfill can be roughly estimated from the inclination of the facing panels, using a simple plastic theory, it is possible to evaluate whether the backfill has reached its peak state or not. The formation of slip lines observed in the centrifuge model tests could be well explained by this method. Finally, the method is proposed to estimate the failure sections in the GRSWs using a Two Wedge analysis.

Influence of freeze-thaw action on deformation-strength characteristics and particle crushability of volcanic coarse-grained soils	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	5		785	799			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84866903972&partnerID=40&md5=ffba4505783178c8e646ccf1863a683a	Faculty of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Japan	Ishikawa, T., Faculty of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Japan; Miura, S., Faculty of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Japan	The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of freeze-thaw action on the deformation-strength characteristics of crushable volcanic coarse-grained soils, wherein significant particle breakage occurs even under relatively low stress levels and saturated conditions. A series of monotonic triaxial compression tests was performed for volcanic coarsegrained soils under various freeze-thaw histories. On the basis of the test results, we examined the above-mentioned effect and the relationship between the degree of particle breakage and the freeze-thaw history. The results indicate that the degree of particle breakage under consolidation and shear increased with freeze-thaw action; and consequently, the strength and the stiffness of the soils decreased with an increase in the number of freeze-thaw cycles. Moreover, to examine the influence of freeze-thaw action on the single-particle hardness of volcanic coarse-grained soils, single-particle crushing tests were conducted. The test results revealed that volcanic soil particles become more fragile after being exposed to freeze-thaw action, and as a result, the degree of particle breakage increases. These results indicate that the freeze-thaw action has a strong influence on the deformation-strength characteristics of crushable volcanic soils in terms of an increase in particle breakage, even if the soils lack frost-heave characteristics.

In the isotache model, compression curves are not only determined by pressure, but also by strain rate. The validity of this model has been experimentally confirmed by many researchers using different types of oedometer tests, such as constant rate of strain (CRS) tests, incremental loading (IL) tests, etc. However, considerable scatter has been observed in the test results, which show the effects of the strain rate, and questions arise as to whether such scatter is caused by the heterogeneity of the soil samples or by the incompletion of the model. To avoid the heterogeneity of the tested samples, special CRS tests, in which the strain rate is not kept constant but is varied during the tests, were carried out on intact and reconstituted Osaka clay samples. The effects of the strain rate on the compressive behavior of these clays were carefully evaluated in terms of visco-plastic strain, assuming that the total strain consists of visco-plastic strain and elastic strain. It was confirmed that the stress and the visco-plastic strain relation of clay samples strongly depends on the visco-plastic strain rate. However, the effects of the strain rate, under a given constant visco-plastic strain rate, do not become constant when the visco-plastic strain rate becomes very small. The reason is assumed to be due to the development of structures under a constant small visco-plastic strain rate. The development of structures may restrict the applicability of the isotache model to the compressive behavior of clay.

The CTGS particles are crushable and deformable, thus forming a compressible material. Besides being a lightweight material, CTGS is a granular material, and is therefore expected to be applied in reclamations or as a back fill or subsoil materials. This study investigates the deformation and crushing of the CTGS particles and their effects on the stress-strain behaviors. The comprehensive investigation of the principle of treatment, the micro-structure of particles, triaxial stress-strain behaviors, induced particle crushing and particle deformation are first presented via the experimental work done on two types CTGS produced from a lean-mixture design of cement and polymer. Subsequently, the results of X-ray Computer Topography (CT) scanners along with triaxial CD tests on CTGS and conventional gravel having rigid particles are presented. The test results reveal local failure mechanisms between the individual particles of the CTGS and gravel, from which the failure models of the granular materials formed by deformable and crushable grains and non-crushable grains are interpreted.

The initial shear stiffness was obtained from bi-directional bender element tests during isotropic and K 0 stress loading and unloading. An empirical correlation was established based on the initial stiffness of normally consolidated soils. Unlike the unique relationship of the initial vertical stiffness of normally consolidated clays, the initial stiffness in the horizontal plane is dependent on the stress ratio and previous stress history; thus, three different relationships of the initial horizontal stiffness were obtained for the three loading programs. The effect of the stress history on the initial horizontal stiffness can be considered properly by defining the degree of overconsolidation in terms of the horizontal effective stress. The change in the initial stiffness has a directional dependency on the stress history in the direction of the particle motion and wave propagation in the bender element tests.

A total of seven particle shapes are standardized and quantified. Three different particle models, including a circular particle model, a non-crushing particle model, and a crushing particle model, are developed and analyzed. The results show that shear strength is mobilized in size order: 3 ball>6 ball-T>2 ball>6 ball-R>4 ball>9 ball>1 ball model, corresponding to triangle>rectangle>square> circle shape in both the non-crushing particle model and the crushing particle model. Within the same shape but with a different number of sub-particles, it is found that an increase in the number of sub-particles within a particle coincides with smaller shear strength per model. The non-crushing particle model shows the increase of porosity not only in the shear band, but also in other layers. However, in the case of the crushing particle model, the increase of porosity is mainly focused within the shear band. It is found that with a larger circularity and convexity, that is, as a particle becomes more circular in shape, the shear strength decreases, regardless of particle crushing. It can be concluded that the standardized particle shape model suggested in this research has broader applications for future studies.

In order to investigate coaxiality, or non-coaxiality, between these two principal directions, a series of drained tests on dry Hostun sand was carried out using a precision Hollow Cylinder Apparatus (HCA). The applied stress path includes large Principal Stress Axes Rotation (PSAR). Two of the three principal stresses are kept constant. Therefore, among the three principal stresses, only the intermediate principal stress, which is confining pressure (same pressure outside the hollow cylinder for internal and external lateral surfaces), changes during loading. During these tests, at different stress levels, elastic (or quasi-elastic) properties are also investigated, using small amplitude quasi-static cycles. These small cycles are performed in two different directions by successively changing only the axial stress σ zz or the shear stress σ uz. Elastic experimental properties are well simulated using the DI Bendetto-Geoffroy-Sauzeat (DBGS) hypo-elastic model, which takes into account PSAR. For each test, the elastic part of deformation is calculated using the DBGS model and removed from global strain so that it is possible to to focus only on the irreversible part (plastic part). Then, the principal directions of stress and plastic strain increment are compared. Experimental results show that there is no coaxiality between these directions. This observation attests to the existence of a non-coaxial plasticity. In addition, the coupling between tge coaxial and non-coaxial part is clearly shown. Experimental results reveal that the plastic strain part is very important for the first large amplitude cycles and remains greater than the elastic part even after 20 cycles.

The onset of strain localization in cross-anisotropic soils under true triaxial condition	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	4		693	700			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84867909926&partnerID=40&md5=d33c996b1198759c80c0174708628244	Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Geotechnical Engineering, Tongji University, China	Lu, X., Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Geotechnical Engineering, Tongji University, China; Huang, M., Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Geotechnical Engineering, Tongji University, China; Qian, J., Key Laboratory of Geotechnical and Underground Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Geotechnical Engineering, Tongji University, China	The influences of inherent cross-anisotropy on soil strength on the homogeneous deformation and bifurcation characteristic of the stress-strain relationship are studied. By neglecting the cohesion term and employing an elliptical shape function in Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, a 3D anisotropic failure criterion is proposed to describe the strength of cross-anisotropic sands under true triaxial conditions. Based on the proposed failure criterion, the influence of the anisotropic parameter on the failure curve on the deviatoric plane and the relationship between the peak friction angle and the intermediate principal stress ratio are obtained. The suitability of the criterion is justified by comparing with a series of true triaxial tests on sands without strain localization. The proposed failure criterion is adopted to build a three dimensional anisotropic elasto-plastic model, which allows the bifurcation analysis to be incorporated with the non-coaxial flow rule for the purpose of studying the onset of strain localization. Compared with the true triaxial tests under several intermediate principal stress ratios conditions in the literature, the proposed model and bifurcation analysis is shown to be capable of predicting the influence of inherent cross-anisotropy on the onset of strain localization.

In order to effectively and confidently design cement-mixed soil structures for specific purposes, its stress-strain behavior needs to be well understood. Though there have been many studies on cement-mixed soils using different types of soils, their behaviors have not been generalized yet. As is the case with concrete materials, the hydration of cement in cement-mixed soil continues with time, thereby improving the strength and deformation characteristics of cement-mixed soil over time. In the field, the cementation bonds are formed under stress in case of in-situ soil. However, in the usual testing techniques, cementation bonds under stress has not been a point of consideration in most of the previous studies. This has led to an underestimation of the stress-strain behavior of cement-mixed soil. On the other hand, soils are subjected to confining stress during loading which has also some effect on the strength and deformation characteristics of soil which has not been considered yet in the case of cement-mixed sand. This study investigates the effect of curing stress and period on the strength and deformation characteristics of cement-mixed sand. The effect of confining stress in the triaxial test is also investigated in another series of specimens. A series of consolidated drained (CD) triaxial compression (TC) tests were done along with the small strain cyclic loading and bender element tests during monotonic loading to determine the small strain Young's modulus (E v) and shear modulus (G vh) respectively. The effect of the curing period is significant in the peak strength, stiffness, E v, G vh and also in the post peak regime. The curing stress also has a significant effect on the peak strength, E v and G vh. The confining stress has an effect on the peak strength, stiffness and in the post peak regime. However, the effect is small compared to clean sand.

Arch action over an excavated pit on a stable scarp investigated by physical model tests	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	4		723	735			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84867910766&partnerID=40&md5=db59f12e5633610be08ad9033e191263	International Development Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan; Global Scientific Information and Computing Center, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan	Khosravi, M.H., International Development Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan; Pipatpongsa, T., Global Scientific Information and Computing Center, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan; Takahashi, A., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan; Takemura, J., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan	Some slope failures along oblique faults experience arch to the extent that the stable scarp can be observed after collapse. The load resisting the scarp is transferred to the side supports by the circumferential forces across the exposed face, separating it from the force acting normal to the slope and the frictional resistance which runs along it. Therefore, the failure mechanism involves a passive condition where the major principal stresses dominate the force supporting the arches. This study presents the groundwork carried out to confirm the assumption of a passive condition appearing in the scarp of the inclined slope by measuring the pressure changes and the surface movement of a physical model. Moist sand was uniformly layered inside a rigid acrylic frame fixed on a slope and base made of rigid acrylic plates. The movement distributions of the slopes were recorded and analyzed using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and image processing software. As the toe of the slope was sliced and cut in sequence, starting from the middle part, the removal of the propped portion resulted in a slip along the surface. Since the moist sand fails inward rather than outward, it is reasonable to assume that the lateral compression is greater than the inclined compression, to the extent where it is sufficient to initiate arch action in a passive condition.

The non-wetting nature of soils originating from the organic contamination of geoenvironments and natural hazards causes unexpected geo-events such as impermeation of water and hillslope runoff due to the changes in soil wettability. This study presents an experimental and numerical investigation to understand the evolution of capillary force and pressure for unsaturated soils whose surface wettability is wettable (hydrophilic) and water-repellent (hydrophobic). Hydrophobic granular materials are synthesized by the silanization technique with 0.5 mm diameter glass beads. The small-strain shear stiffness and corresponding degree of saturation are continuously monitored during evaporation for both specimens. The peak value of maximum shear stiffness is captured at a degree of saturation S∼5.5% for hydrophilic specimen, while the hydrophobic specimen shows a quasiconstant small-strain stiffness during evaporation. The minimization of free energy for the liquid bridge between the two-particle system allows the attractive and repulsive capillary force and pressure produced between particles to be numerically estimated. The regime of zero-capillary pressure is identified depending on the contact angle and volume of liquid bridge. The measurement of small-strain stiffness combined with the numerical simulation of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic specimens clarifies the governing factors to determine capillarity in the granular materials and provides insight into the phenomenological observation of capillary pressure for unsaturated soils.

Relationship between shear wave velocity and stresses at failure for weakly cemented sands during drained triaxial compression	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	4		761	771		1	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84867915320&partnerID=40&md5=5946a1b4a0e34e2fcced02122abc6b60	Ocean and Coastal Consultants Inc., COWI Company, United States; Department of Civil/ocean Engineering, University of Rhode Island, United States	Sharma, R., Ocean and Coastal Consultants Inc., COWI Company, United States; Baxter, C., Department of Civil/ocean Engineering, University of Rhode Island, United States; Jander, M., Department of Civil/ocean Engineering, University of Rhode Island, United States	Small strain shear modulus (G max) has been a parameter of choice used to assess the strength and deformation behavior of cemented and other sensitive soils. The influence of density, effective confining stress, stress anisotropy, and cement content on shear wave velocity (v s)/shear modulus has been studied extensively and published. There are, however, very few studies on the effects of cement/strength degradation during shear on the shear wave velocity/shear modulus, which may be important for reliable and accurate prediction of mechanical behavior of cemented sands. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of cement degradation on shear wave velocity/shear modulus by measuring continuously the shear wave velocity during shear. A laboratory testing program was performed using samples of silty sand artificially cemented with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC). Shear wave velocity was measured continuously within the triaxial cell during the shear phase using torsional ring transducers. G max was calculated using the shear wave velocity and the corresponding density during shear. Results from this study suggest that G max reaches a peak value before σ 1 reaches a failure stress and this behavior is believed to be an indicator of bond breakage or destructuring. G max calculated at various stages during shear showed that the cement and modulus degradation can be represented by a simple index using G max. The results of this study suggest that there may be a unique relationship between small strain shear modulus and effective stresses at failure for dilative soils implying that in situ shear wave velocity measurements may be used to estimate effective stress strength parameters or as a precursor to failure in weakly cemented soils.

The shear strength of such composite materials is affected by the micro and macro mechanical characteristics of both the fibres and the soils (e.g., relative sizes of fibres and soil grains, fibres aspect ratio, stress state, mechanical properties of the fibres), yet no model is available to explicitly take all of them into account. The aim of this work is to establish a new expression for the shear strength of the reinforced material, able to consider the main characteristics of the soil and the fibres as well as the effect of fibre to grains relative dimensions. Data from triaxial tests carried out on fibre reinforced soils with distinct grain size distributions (from clayey sands to sandy gravels) and from previous experimental works were considered and have been analysed successfully within the proposed framework.

Shear strength properties of a residual soil in Singapore	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	4		565	573		1	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84867904729&partnerID=40&md5=555c6d14823d813ad279369dd8f6b79b	School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore	Meng, G-H., School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore; Chu, J., School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore	The shear strength and stress-strain behaviour of residual soil are known to be affected significantly not only by the initial porosity and stress history, but also by the bonds between particles. Although residual soil is commonly encountered during constructions in the tropical region, studies on its engineering properties are far from adequate. There is a lack of in-depth study to characterize the strength and deformation behaviour of intact residual soils in Singapore, especially under more representative testing conditions such as plane-strain conditions. In relation to a tunnelling construction project in Singapore, the engineering properties of an intact residual soil were characterised using laboratory tests. Large block undisturbed soil samples taken from a construction site were used. K 0 consolidated undrained triaxial compression (CK 0UC), extension (CK 0UE), direct simple shear (CK 0UDSS), and K 0 consolidated undrained planestrain (CK 0UPS) tests were conducted. The undrained shear strength ratio c u/σ 10 and overconsolidation ratio (OCR) relationships were established. The test results indicate that the undrained shear strength (c u) of the intact residual soil is highly anisotropic in term of c u/σ 10 ratio. It is also noted from the experimental results that the secant friction angles were highly dependent on consolidation stresses, as well as the testing methods.

A number of slope failures and debris flows occurred in Yamaguchi and Fukuoka prefectures resulting in extensive damage to human life and infrastructure. One of the most serious geodisasters included a slope failure followed by debris flow at Sasaguri-machi and Fukuchi-machi, Fukuoka prefecture, Japan. This paper summarizes the results of geotechnical investigations on the geodisaster sites in Fukuoka prefecture. The geotechnical investigation included determining a series of grain size distributions, consistency limits and conducting direct box shear tests for collapsed soils collected at six disaster sites. The generation mechanisms of slope failure followed by debris flow were also investigated by analyzing the precipitation, topography, geology, and strength properties of the collapsed soils. Moreover, slope deformation and stability analyses were coupled with an unsaturatedsaturated seepage analysis to investigate the slope failure mechanism. The main findings from the study are summarized as: The physical properties, such as the grain size distribution, the plastic limit and liquid limit of collapsed soils, are summarized and compared with the results of other failure slopes in the literature. The collapsed soil was characterized as being a well grained soil (the uniformity coefficient >50) and highly weathered (the ignition loss >5z), however, with regard to the liquid limit and plastic index, there were no remarkable findings. The original shear strength for collapsed soils with natural water content is relatively large and slope failure doesn't occur because the cohesion in the shear strength is induced by a suction force between the soil particles under unsaturated condition. However, water seepage into the soil induces a drastic decrease in the shear strength, which is mainly caused by a decrease in cohesion (losing suction) resulting from soil saturation. In addition, the drained/undrained condition in the shear process is also sensitive to shear strength. For example, both water seepage and the shear process with constant volume cause an approximate 30z reduction in shear strength for Fukuchi-machi and Sasaguri-machi soil samples. Therefore, the reduction of cohesive strength due to water seepage and the low permeability of the slope are the parameters which trigger geodisaster. Based on the results of slope deformation and a stability analyses which took the change in water pressure and cohesive strength into account, the geodisaster at Fukuchi-machi was simulated, it is reasonable to assume that the shallow failure near the top of slope occurred due to torrential precipitation of about 100 mm per hour which triggered a debris flow.

Small-strain sti.ness of soils was studied in the past years using di.erent experimental devices (mainly resonant columns). However, the results have been relatively inconsistent. The bender elements technique, now extensively used in soil mechanics, o.ers an e.cient non destructive alternative, since it is based on the propagation of shear waves. To enrich the common bender elements testing results providing only shear modulus values, an evolution of the bender elements technique, named bender-extender element's is used in this paper. This device allows the simultaneous measurement of the shear and compression wave velocities. As a result, the two independent elastic constants are measured for the same sample in order to avoid indirect estimations. Also, for uncon.ned sample's the GrindoSonic test is performed: this test is based on the transient vibrational response of the sample to a slight shock. The present study provides new results about the elastic properties of intermediate unsaturated soils made of mixtures of sand and clay. The results for the elastic properties are presented as a function of the suction level. Finally, a model relating the elastic behaviour of these unsaturated soils is proposed.

Civil Engineering, University of Bristol, United Kingdom	For the assessment of the quality of laboratory samples, a number of methods are available, though not universally applicable to any soils. This paper examines the issue of sampling quality and its assessment using comparisons between shear wave velocity measurements in situ and in recovered samples as the base, which is very useful in naturally structured granular soils, like residual soils. For this purpose, cross-hole and down-hole tests were performed in the field and bender elements measurements were made on triaxial samples collected from two experimental sites on residual soil from Porto granite. Various sampling techniques and tools were used, including block sampling and different tube samplers. The analysis of the results has led to a new classification of sampling quality and sample condition based on the comparison of normalised shear wave velocities in the field and in the laboratory.

The addition of fibres can convert the strain softening response, typical of a loose unreinforced sand, into a strain hardening response by affecting the pore pressure generation and the effective stress path response. A new constitutive model based on the rule of mixtures has been used to simulate the undrained response of fibre reinforced sands. The model superimposes the individual contributions of the sand and the fibres according to their volumetric fraction. An apparent densification of the sand matrix induced by the presence of the fibres is accounted for in the model by assigning some of the void space to the fibres. This apparent densi fication is considered responsible for the observed strain hardening behaviour of reinforced sands. The proposed model is able to accommodate any distribution of fibre orientation: the orientation of fibres plays a key role in explaining the experimentally observed effective stress paths.

This approach differs from earlier experimental work in which a unique and static critical state line was assumed: the basic difference between the two approaches being the question of whether the soil ̀̀ knows about the breakage that it has undergone. A series of triaxial tests was therefore conducted to investigate the effect of particle breakage on the current location of the critical state line. Two different shearing stages were used: the first to produce particle breakage and the second one to see if the material ̀̀remembers the original state if sheared again. It was found that the critical state line does move with particle breakage, so indicating that the soil does ̀̀know about the breakage that has occurred. However, large amounts of breakage were required to create a significant shift. The results show, furthermore, that the effect of the change of grading is not only a verticle movement in the the critical state line but also a rotation. Comparisons with the behaviour of reconstituted samples with the same grading as the pre-sheared samples demonstrated that while the soil does have some ̀̀knowledge that it has undergone breakage, the initial grading remains more important than the current grading in determining its behaviour. An analysis of thin sections showed that this is probably because when particles break, the broken fragments remain in close proximity to each other and are not distributed uniformly throughout the soils.

Monotonic and cyclic behavior of unsaturated sandy soil under drained and fully undrained conditions	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	4		663	681			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84867912859&partnerID=40&md5=7db8b47980302c41c359d99672f127c1	Department of Civil and Earth Resources Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan	Kimoto, S., Department of Civil and Earth Resources Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Oka, F., Department of Civil and Earth Resources Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Fukutani, J., Department of Civil and Earth Resources Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Yabuki, T., Department of Civil and Earth Resources Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Nakashima, K.	Changes in air pressure during monotonic and cyclic loading are in some cases important for the behavior of unsaturated soil. For example, in order to investigate the stability of embankments and slope failure during earthquakes, it is necessary to consider the effect of the pore air or the pore gas pressure as well as the pore water pressure and the interaction between the soil and the pore fluids. In the present study, we carried out a series of monotonic and cyclic loading tests on sandy soil used for the improvement of river embankments. The effects of the initial suction, the confining pressure, and the degree of compaction under fully undrained conditions, namely, constant water and constant air shearing tests, as well as under drained conditions for both air and water, were studied. For the stress variables of the unsaturated soil, the skeleton stress was used to describe the experimental results and was defined as the difference between the total stress tensor and the average pore pressure of water and gas (Oka et al., 2010). From the monotonic and cyclic test results, we found that the stress-strain behavior of unsaturated sandy soil strongly depends on the initial suction, especially under fully undrained conditions, due to the difference in pore pressures. In the cyclic loading tests under fully undrained conditions, the mean skeleton stress decreased due to the increase in air pressure and led to the failure of the specimen in the case of a lower level of initial suction. In addition, the test results exhibited the strain rate effect on the stress-strain behavior during cyclic loading under fully undrained conditions.

Seismic earth pressure exerted on retaining walls under a large seismic load	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	3		379	394		1	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84861899514&partnerID=40&md5=384d5b97423f8474db23ad79da05ffa8	Structures Technology Division, Railway Technical Research Institute, Japan; Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Japan	Watanabe, K., Structures Technology Division, Railway Technical Research Institute, Japan; Koseki, J., Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Japan; Tateyama, M., Structures Technology Division, Railway Technical Research Institute, Japan	In recent years, serious damage has been done to retaining structures because of large earthquakes. In order to establish practical methods for evaluating the seismic earth pressure, which is one of the important external forces acting on retaining structures during large earthquakes, a series of shaking table tests was conducted on retaining wall (RW) models. The experiments revealed that the seismic active earth pressure was considerably smaller than that obtained by the Mononobe-Okabe theory, particularly under a large seismic load. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the seismic earth pressure had an upper limit, which was determined by the force equilibrium of the soil wedge at the critical state when the RW lost its stability. On the basis of the test results, a new method to evaluate the seismic earth pressure for practical designs under a large seismic load has been suggested. This proposed method provides a reasonable earth pressure as well as an angle of failure plane, those of which depend on the seismic stability of the retaining wall. It has been confirmed that earth pressure obtained by the proposed method agrees well with the measured seismic earth pressure exerted on several retaining walls with different degrees of stability.

Two residual soil slopes in two main geological formations in Singapore, the Bukit Timah Granite and the sedimentary Jurong Formation, were fully instrumented. Real-time monitoring systems were developed to examine the pore-water pressure, the rainfall and the groundwater level of the slopes for over a year. The characteristics of the pore-water pressure distributions in both slopes during rainfall were highlighted and compared. The monitoring results indicate that the residual soil slope of the Bukit Timah Granite has a thicker unsaturated zone due to a deeper groundwater table than the residual soil slope of the sedimentary Jurong Formation. A higher permeability of the residual soil of the Bukit Timah Granite results in more rapid changes in negative pore-water pressure due to rainwater infiltration than the residual soil of the sedimentary Jurong Formation. Therefore, the residual soil slope of the Bukit Timah Granite differs from the residual soil slope of the sedimentary Jurong Formation in the changes in shear strength and the variations in the factor of safety during rainfall. The differing characteristics of the pore-water pressure responses during rainfall for these two residual soil slopes are analyzed in the present study based on the results of field measurements and numerical analyses.

Investigation of settlement and load sharing on piled rafts by monitoring full-scale structures	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	3		513	532		1	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84866900478&partnerID=40&md5=cd4ed511245ba358f979427d111c4625	R and D Institute, Takenaka Corporation, Chiba, Japan	Yamashita, K., R and D Institute, Takenaka Corporation, Chiba, Japan; Yamada, T., R and D Institute, Takenaka Corporation, Chiba, Japan; Hamada, J., R and D Institute, Takenaka Corporation, Chiba, Japan	This paper offers five recent case histories of piled raft foundations in Japan. The buildings are 19 to 162 m in height above the ground surface and were completed in 2005-2009. The piled rafts were designed based on a numerical analysis using the simplified method developed by Yamashita et al. (1998) with soil deformation parameters evaluated from the soil's shear modulus at very small strains. To confirm the validity of the foundation design, field measurements were performed on the foundation settlements and the load sharing between the rafts and the piles by monitoring the five structures from the beginning of their construction to 17 to 60 months after the end of their construction. The measured settlements were 19 to 24 mm, and the ratios of the load carried by the piles to the effective load of each structure in the tributary area, α' p, were estimated to be 0.61 to 0.93 at the end of the observation period. The predicted maximum settlements and angular rotations of the rafts in the design were generally consistent with the measured values, and the ratios of the load carried by the piles to the total load assumed in the design were also consistent with those estimated from the measurements. Based on the measurement results from ten case histories, namely, five previously published case histories and five from the present study, it has been found that the value of α' p generally decreases as the pile spacing ratio is increased. The value of α' p seems to decrease gradually with a pile spacing ratio larger than about six, whereas the value of α' p seems to decrease significantly as the pile spacing ratio is increased from about four to six. Based on the measurement results, it is suggested that piled rafts work more effectively at a pile spacing ratio of larger than about six, where at least 30z of the effective load of the structure can be carried by the rafts.

Short-duration, high-intensity rainfall will increase the pore-water pressure. As a result, the shear strength of the soil in the slopes decreases and the stability of the slopes is affected. In this study, horizontal drains were installed in a residual soil slope in Singapore in order to improve the stability of the slope. The slope was instrumented with tensiometers and piezometers to investigate the effectiveness of the horizontal drains as a slope stabilization method against rainfall-induced slope failures. The variations in water table elevation and matric suction in the slope due to rainfall events were monitored. In addition, numerical analyses of the seepage into the slope brought about by the rainfall were carried out, and the results showed a reasonably good agreement with the data obtained from field measurements. The field measurement results indicated that horizontal drains were indeed effective for lowering the water table and for increasing the stability of the investigated slope. Therefore, horizontal drains are considered to be a useful and economical method for improving the stability of residual soil slopes against rainfall.

In this study, a lightweight dynamic cone penetration test (LWDCPT) has been introduced for a geotechnical survey of natural weathered granitic (Masado) slopes. Based on a series of direct shear tests, the internal friction angle and the apparent cohesion of reconstituted Masado soil were found to be fairly closely related to the void ratio and the degree of saturation in the soil. From the laboratory calibration tests, an equation was created to relate the dynamic cone resistance (q d) and the void ratio of reconstituted Masado under different degrees of saturation. Equations were developed to calculate the internal friction angle and the apparent cohesion from the value of q d for Masado at a known degree of saturation. LWDCPT and direct shear tests were carried out on undisturbed samples taken from a natural Masado slope. The estimated internal friction angle and the apparent cohesion calculated with the value of q d in the LWDCPTs agreed fairly well with those of tests on the undisturbed samples obtained in laboratory shear tests.

Effect of depth on the seismic response of square tunnels	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	3		449	457			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84866920307&partnerID=40&md5=981fd323845c9f43012cb5341cb998ac	Engineering Department, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom	Cilingir, U., Engineering Department, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom; Madabhushi, S.P.G., Engineering Department, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom	Response of tunnels to earthquake induced loads is a complex dynamic soil-structure interaction problem. While there seems to be a general consensus that tunnels in rock perform adequately during earthquake events, the seismic performance of shallow tunnels in soils is less certain. More experimental and field data is needed to better understand the dynamic tunnel-soil interaction. In this paper, the behaviour of relatively shallow tunnels of square cross-section located in a sand deposit is investigated using dynamic centrifuge modelling and complimentary Finite Element analysis. Emphasis is given on the effect of tunnel axis depth on the seismic response of square tunnels. Dynamic centrifuge tests were carried out on model tunnels at different depths of embedment. Accelerations around the tunnel and earth pressures on the linings were measured. Tunnel deformations were also recorded using a fast digital camera. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) analyses were conducted to measure soil and lining deformations. Results show that for the cases investigated, the depth of the tunnel does not effect the deformation pattern of the tunnel significantly during an earthquake event; however it affects the amount of amplification of accelerations through the tunnel, the magnitude of dynamic earth pressures and the magnitude of the lining forces.

The layer may have liquefied if it had been saturated at the time of the earthquake. Undrained cyclic triaxial tests comprise one of the available experimental approaches for evaluating the liquefaction behavior of such thin sandy soil layers. In this study, a series of undrained cyclic triaxial tests was performed on specimens containing an artificial sand layer in order to investigate the effects of system compliance that are possibly induced by partial drainage caused by the changes in volume of the filter paper used to saturate the sand layer and the local drainage at the interface among the specimen, the top cap and pedestal, and the rubber membrane. The observed liquefaction behavior depended on the thickness of the sand layer under otherwise similar conditions, suggesting the significant effect of system compliance. By conducting special tests, while correcting the partial drainage, it was possible to reduce its effect on the liquefaction behavior. Cylindrical specimens with a top cap and pedestal, all having the same diameter, exhibited a smaller effect from partial drainage than prismatic specimens with an oversized top cap and pedestal.

A performance evaluation was conducted in the laboratory on groundwater contaminated with artificial arsenic using sodium arsenate (Na 2HAsO 4.7H 2O) to simulate the arsenic concentration in the groundwater. Batch and column experiments were performed to evaluate the arsenic removal capacity by zero valent iron and the removal mechanism. The flow rate (up-flow mode) was maintained for 180 days in each column. The results from both the batch and the column experiments showed that more than 99zof the arsenic was removed successfully. In the column experiments, the arsenic was efficiently removed and the arsenic concentration in the treated water decreased to below the limit of 10 mg /L (WHO's standard) even when the columns were packed with only 25z ZVI by volume. We used SEM and XRD to characterize the surface morphology and the corrosion layer which formed on pristine ZVI and arsenic- treated ZVI to elucidate the arsenic removal mechanism. XRD and SEM results revealed that ZVI gradually converted to a magnetite/maghemite corrosion product mixed with lepidocrocite. Adsorption followed by co-precipitation was an important pathway to removing the arsenic by ZVI. Our results suggest that ZVI, combined with sand, is a suitable candidate for the ex-situ treatment of groundwater in the neutral pH range and in the presence of dissolved oxygen.

K 0 consolidated strain path tests were conducted on Changi sand using a plane-strain apparatus. The test results show that the occurrence of pre-failure instability under plane-strain conditions is affected by the void ratio and the strain increment ratio. This is consistent with previous findings established under axisymmetric conditions. However, instability behavior of medium dense sand in strain path-controlled plane-strain tests can also be affected by shear band formation. In this case, on-failure instability takes place and failure is likely caused by shear band development. This observation is different from that in triaxial strain path-controlled tests where shear bands do not normally occur.

The liquefaction-induced damage occurring in many residential areas was investigated in detail by means of victim interviews, visual inspections, Swedish Weight Sounding tests, Standard Penetration Tests, old topographical map examinations, etc. Based on in situ soil investigations, the liquefied soil layers were estimated for each area. As a result, it was confirmed that the liquefied areas were mainly sand dune hinterlands, flood plains, reclaimed old river channels and sandy fills with high groundwater table. Among them, damage was especially serious on land having an inclined ground surface due to the flow of foundations, on the cut-fill borders of artificially developed land due to landslides and at the toes of sand dune slopes due to the thrust of the sliding soil and/or the collision of the sliding soil with objects. These investigation results also revealed that soil improvement by cement mixed columns is an effective countermeasure against liquefaction-induced damage unless lateral spreading of the subsoil arises.

Uplift capacity of belled and multi-belled piles in dense sand	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	3		483	496			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84866916117&partnerID=40&md5=e496ee6a2061a05a42ced4f2222958e4	Research and Development Institute, Takenaka Corporation, Chiba, Japan; Soil Remediation Engineering Department, Takenaka Corpora, Japan	Honda, T., Research and Development Institute, Takenaka Corporation, Chiba, Japan; Hirai, Y., Research and Development Institute, Takenaka Corporation, Chiba, Japan; Sato, E., Soil Remediation Engineering Department, Takenaka Corpora, Japan	This paper evaluates the uplift capacity of belled and multi-belled piles in dense sand. A two-dimensional distinct element (DE) analysis was applied in pullout tests on single piles to investigate the uplift resistance of the piles, the soil behavior around the piles, and the interaction between the soil and the pile surface. It was observed from the DE analysis that the soil mass adjacent to the projections of the belled and multi-belled piles moved vertically, and that the soil movements leaned slightly with the occurrence of relative displacement between the soil and the pile surface. A theoretical solution for predicting the uplift capacity of belled and multi-belled piles was derived from an upper bound limit analysis based on the soil movements in the DE analysis. The solution was able to reproduce the ultimate uplift resistance in the DE analysis using the friction angles in the aggregates and on the pile surface that were evaluated from a simulation of direct and simple shear tests. In addition, a continuity equation that satisfied the relationship between the displacement vector of the soil mass adjacent to the projections and the change in volume around the soil mass was proposed for predicting the uplift capacity of actual piles under axisymmetric conditions. The theoretical solution obtained with the continuity equation was in good agreement with the pullout resistance of the belled and multi-belled piles in centrifuge model tests and full-scale tests conducted in situ.

Four footing models, each of which had a smooth or rough surface and was embedded or not embedded in soil, were subjected to strong shaking. The horizontal shearing and the vertical compressive forces on the base of each footing, as well as the earth pressure and the wall friction forces on the active/passive sides of each footing, were elaborately measured with newly developed 2D load cells. It was shown that (1) the collision impulse of the uplifted footing against the ground induced an extremely high vertical acceleration of the structure, which was much larger than could be induced by the vertical movement of the gravitational center of the structure; (2) the vertical acceleration caused by the collision impulse increased with the induced rotation angle of the footing; (3) if the footing was not embedded in the ground, the rotation angle and the resulting vertical acceleration tended to be larger for the rough footing than for the smooth footing, probably because the larger horizontal sliding of the smooth footing was able to reduce the footing rotation; and (4) if the footing was embedded, by contrast, the rotation angle and the resulting vertical acceleration tended to be smaller for the rough footing than for the smooth footing, probably because the larger wall friction that developed on the passive side in the rough footing was able to reduce the footing rotation.

Most of the past studies related to the arching effect and the trapdoor problem were performed under plane strain or axisymetric conditions. The observation of the arching mechanisms is indeed simplified under these special test conditions. In this paper, the trapdoor problem was simulated under three-dimensional testing conditions with a square-shaped trapdoor. The granular layers were made with monodisperse glass beads. The arching mechanisms were experimentally investigated with X-ray Computed Tomography. Based on the images obtained, the propagation in the granular layer of the disturbance due to the displacement of the trapdoor was monitored. On the other side, the intensity of the load transfers in the granular material was evaluated with a force measurement apparatus on the trapdoor. In parallel, a numerical analysis involving the Discrete Element Method was conducted to predict both the qualitative and the quantitative phenomena. The gradual local expansion of the granular layer due to trapdoor displacement and the load transfer amplitudes were very well reproduced. An agreement between the experimental and the numerical results was obtained for small displacements of the trapdoor (high load transfers) as well as for larger displacements of the trapdoor.

With this apparatus, 2D model tests are carried out to investigate the surface settlement and the earth pressure brought about by the tunneling. Finite element analyses using an elastoplastic subloading tij model are also conducted. The influence of volume loss on the surface settlement and the earth pressure, due to the shallow tunnelling, is illustrated based on the model tests and the corresponding numerical analyses. It is revealed that the surface settlement troughs and the earth pressure distributions around shallow tunnels depend on both the volume loss and the crown drift of the tunnel. The effect of the interaction between the tunneling and existing nearby foundations is also demonstrated in this paper. For existing foundations, the building loads control the surface settlements and the zone of deformation during the tunnel excavation. The behavior of the foundations depends on the deformation mechanism of the ground during the tunnel excavation. The induced axial force and bending moments in the piles of a piled raft are investigated numerically, and it is shown that the axial force changes due to the stress relaxation of the ground. Bending moments are induced in the piles at a lower value of soil cover due to the differential settlement of the piled raft.

Samples were prepared at varying gravimetric water contents, ranging from natural to 70z, with the use of distilled water. The soil fabric was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). The mechanical behaviour was studied by constant rate of strain (CRS) consolidation testing and constant volume direct shear (CVDS) testing. The results indicate that while an increase in water content resulted in the formation of aggregates and an increase in shear strength, it was the dilatancy behaviour that was most affected. The saturation of Kunigel-V1 resulted in a decrease in the friction angle, from 40.4° to 20.4°, while the saturation of NSF Clay resulted in a decrease in friction angle from over 40° to 32.3°.

A jet grouting method with a jet pressure of 22 MPa, was utilized in the installation of DCM piles. The SDCM pile consists of a DCM pile with a precast reinforced concrete core pile inserted at its center. Pile and embankment load tests were conducted, and then the results of the field load tests were simulated by a 3D finite element method (FEM) to back-analyze and confirm the related design parameters. These parameters were then used further in numerical experiments. The field test results showed that the settlements and lateral movements of the SDCM pile using a prestressed concrete core pile with area ratio (A corey/A DCM) of 0.17 and a length ratio of 0.85 was less than those of the DCM pile by 40z and 60z, respectively. Moreover, the SDCM pile foundation increased the bearing capacity by as much as 2.2 times. The average lateral pile capacity of the SDCM piles was 15 times higher than the DCM piles. A strength reduction factor of 0.40 was obtained at the concrete core and the DCM interface from the full scale pullout test. The behavior of both the DCM and SDCM piles was confirmed from the subsequent 3D FEM simulations. From the 3D FEM simulations, the length of the concrete core pile had more in- fiuence on the settlements of the SDCM pile than its cross-sectional area. However, both the length and cross-sectional area of concrete core pile affected the lateral resistance of the SDCM pile.

In this paper, an attempt is made to identify the critical factors governing the strength development in cement admixed Bangkok clay in both the laboratory and the field. It is found that clay-water/cement ratio, w c/C is the prime parameter controlling the laboratory strength development when the liquidity index varies between 1 and 2. Based on this parameter and Abrams' law, the strength prediction equation for various curing times and combinations of clay water content and cement content is proposed and verified. This will help minimize the number of trials necessary to arrive at the quantity of cement to be admixed. Besides the w c/C, the strength of deep mixing column is controlled by the execution and curing conditions. For low strength improvement (laboratory 28-day strength less than 1,500 kPa), the field strength of the deep mixing columns, q uf, made up from both dry and wet mixing methods is higher than 0.6 times the laboratory strength, q ul. The q uf/q ul ratios for the wet mixing columns are generally higher than those for the dry mixing columns. This higher strength ratio is due to the dissipation of the excess water in the column (consolidation) caused by the field stress. The water to cement ratio, W/C, of 1.0 is recommended for the wet mixing method of the soft Bangkok clay. A fast installation rate was shown to provide high quality for low strength columns. Suggestions are made for improving the deep mixing of soft Bangkok clay, which are very useful both from economic and engineering viewpoints.

In a vertical section of the central part of the dam, three sets of 3-component accelerometers and 15 pore water pressure meters were installed. During the main shock, the acceleration exceeded 10 m/s 2 at the gallery, inducing large shear strains in excess of 10 -3 and a sudden build-up of the excess pore water pressure in the core. Due to the large strains, the shear wave velocity and shear modulus showed a significant decrease from their initial values and the vibration period was elongated. The decreased shear wave velocity gradually recovered toward the end of the main shock, and continued to recover with the passage of time. The full recovery of the wave velocity was found to take at least one year, while the dissipation of the excess pore water pressure proceeded more quickly than the recovery of the wave velocity.

Different building parts had to be founded partially on the existing tunnel structures and partially on a system of piled-raft and raft foundations. The combined foundation was designed so as to minimize sectional forces due to the different foundation stiffnesses that were the unknowns in the analysis. Based on pile load tests the nonlinear stiffness of piles has been determined. For the design, both foundation components have been first decoupled and analysed separately. Subsequently, the interaction effects have been estimated by a simplified procedure. The pile configuration has been optimized by considering its effects on the superstructure. The performance of the combined foundations has been checked by comparing computed deformations with actual measurements at relevant points. Parallel to this, the system has been analysed by a 3D finite element model. The concept and the key design items of the combined foundation are presented, and a comparison is made between the estimated deformations and the measurements. The methodology for the analysis of building response to train induced vibrations is outlined.

The studied area included the Padang and Pariaman cities, where a number of buildings collapsed as a result of strong shaking, and a mountainous part of the Pariaman district, a place where massive landslides buried several villages, claiming more than 400 human lives. The main objective of the survey was to investigate the causes and mechanisms of catastrophic landslides; however, other geotechnical problems such as lateral spread and liquefaction were also addressed. Field observations indicated that the catastrophic landslides occurred on relatively gentle slopes, then mobilized into debris .ows, and traveled several hundred meters from their points of origin. The failure surfaces developed along the boundary of highly weathered pumice tu. with more intact and less weathered bedrock. Data from a portable cone penetration test showed that the sliding material was rather weak, having SPT N-values in the range of 5-10. The results of the .eld survey suggested that the main cause of slope instability was high pore-water pressures that generated in the soil mass during the earthquake.

One of the authors had conducted microzonation for liquefaction, slope failure and strong shaking about 17 years before the earthquake. After the earthquake, the authors compared the zoning map with the actual damage. The results showed that liquefied sites coincided fairly well with predicted zones in the reclaimed lands. However, they were slightly different in a big sand spit named Uminonakamichi. Failure occurred at several slopes inside the predicted areas, while damage to buildings occurred due to strong shaking along the Kego Fault. The damaged area was slightly different from the predicted area. Furthermore, a liquefaction analysis was conducted and the results of this analysis were compared with the results of microzonation in 1988. In this paper, the authors discuss the validity of microzonation based on this comparison.

In general, at the corresponding degree of saturation values, water component in soil voids is continuous but the air phase is not. The modelling of the infiltration process through compacted soils requires that unsaturated hydraulic functions be defined. A theoretical soil water retention function for soils with a discontinuous air phase is derived using the theory proposed by Schuurman (1966). Data from the test results provide encouraging evidence of the validity of the proposed theory. An empirical hydraulic conductivity function where the air is present in the form of occluded bubbles is also determined by curve fitting to the experimental measurements. A numerical solution of Richards' equation for one-dimensional flow, which incorporates the experimental findings, was used to simulate the measured transient water flow. The results show that the proposed constitutive relationships are capable of producing simulations of the measurements of the unsaturated flow that are both qualitatively and quantitatively realistic.

Parameters controlling strength of industrial waste-lime amended soil	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	2		265	273			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84866676337&partnerID=40&md5=128b51b26d7d2f15e984b0b79b81207f	Department of Civil Engineering, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil	Consoli, N.C., Department of Civil Engineering, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil; Rosa, A.D., Department of Civil Engineering, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil; Saldanha, R.B., Department of Civil Engineering, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil	Unconfined compression tests and suction measurements were carried out in the present work on sandy specimens with distinct Class F fiy ash amounts, lime contents, porosities and curing periods to assess key parameters controlling strength of fiy ash-lime amended soil. A special effort has been allocated in order to develop a dosage methodology for fiy ash-lime improved soils based in a rational criterion, as it exists in the concrete technology where the water/cement ratio plays a fundamental role in the assessment of the target strength. The results show that the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) increased linearly with the amount of lime for soil-fiy ash-lime mixtures at all curing time periods studied. A power function fits better the relation UCS-porosity for soil-fiy ash-lime mixtures. The bigger the amount of fiy ash and the curing time, the larger the UCS for any given porosity and lime content. Finally, the porosity/volumetric lime content ratio, in which volumetric lime content is adjusted by a coeficient (in this case a unique value- 0.12-was found for all soil-fiy ash-lime mixtures and all curing periods studied) to end in single correlations for each curing period, show to be a good parameter in the evaluation of the unconfined compressive strength of the soil studied (UCS varies non-linearly with the porosity/volumetric lime content ratio in the case of fiy ash-lime addition).

Apart from the chemical additives, the alum-polyelectrolyte clay (APC) and untreated clay were similar in composition, comprising 41z micro-fibrous amorphous organic solids by dry mass. However, the geomechanical behavior of the APC material was enhanced by polymer-particle bridging phenomenon, which contributed to higher stress-strain modulus, 10-20z greater shear strength in undrained triaxial compression, a higher effective angle of shearing resistance value, reduced compressibility and a slower rate of consolidation compared to the untreated clay. Hence, this study raises the possibility of using dilute polyelectrolyte solution in combination with aluminum sulfate as an alternative soil improvement measure for organic residues and ultra-soft organic clay deposits.

The slope surface in this area is a colluvium soil cover layer with loose non-uniform particles, with high permeability. Because it is situated above a rapidly changing water table, the pore water pressure varies dynamically, depending on the weather conditions. In the dry season, most of the topsoil behaves in the unsaturated condition such that the matrix suction in the soil increases its shearing strength. In contrast, when heavy rainfall occurs, the seepage by precipitation tends to destroy the existing matrix suction. This reduction in soil strength frequently results in slope failure. This study, focuses on the variation of matrix suction of the colluvium soil in different precipitation conditions with varying vegetation at the campus of Huafan University. The analysis of the in-situ monitoring results and the laboratory test results for the undisturbed specimens taken from the field, with shearing strength and matrix suction taken into account. It is expected the results to be a useful reference for disaster protection on slopes.

A series of centrifuge model tests was conducted on cohesive soil slopes during rainfall, and the displacement and suction of the slopes were measured. The slope exhibits a relatively shallow slide after a heavy rainfall, and exhibits a shear zone with significant deformation in the interior of the slope. The vertical displacement is significantly larger than the horizontal displacement of the slope during rainfall. The rainfall-induced displacement process can be divided into three phases: (1) small displacement, (2) rapid increase, and (3) large displacement with minor rate of increase. Strain analysis was conducted on the basis of the measured displacement, and the results showed that the rainfall-induced deformation of the slope is governed by two types of mechanisms: increasing overburden weight and softening of soil. For a point in the slope, the first mechanism occurs from the beginning of rainfall; and the second mechanism occurs only when the water infiltrates there, which is described using the wetting front. Accordingly, another term, stable front, describes a boundary of zero increment of deformation. These two fronts gradually advance into the slope with increasing rainfall and divide the slope into three zones. The middle zone exhibits the most significant deformation.

From the test results, the stress acting during the formation of cementation plays an important role in the one-dimensional compression characteristics of cement admixed clay. The stress compresses the treated clay and results in an increase in the vertical yield stress. For the cement-admixed clay studied, the effect of the curing stress inherently reflects on the after- curing void ratio. Therefore, the primary vertical yield stress in one-dimensional compression is a function of the after-curing void ratio and the ratio of the clay water content to the cement content ratio.

Sample disturbance effects on undrained shear strengths -study from takuhoku site, sapporo	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	2		203	213		2	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84866646868&partnerID=40&md5=a95aee31a027f8b9afda6b8a4e64f7a0	Institute of Technology of Cambodia, Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan; Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan; Toa Corporation, Japan; Koa Kaihatsu Incorporation, Japan	Horng, V., Institute of Technology of Cambodia, Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan; Tanaka, H., Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan; Hirabayashi, H., Toa Corporation, Japan; Tomita, R., Koa Kaihatsu Incorporation, Japan	The effects of sample disturbance on undrained shear strength were investigated from samples with various qualities, retrieved by different types of samplers at the Takuhoku site, Sapporo. Sample quality was evaluated by three types of shear tests: unconfined compression, fall cone and triaxial recompression tests. Similar to a previous study conducted by Horng et al. (2010), in which the sample quality was evaluated by two nondestructive tests, the residual effective stress (suction) by ceramic disc and the shear modulus by bender element under unconfined conditions, the present study shows that the small edge angle of a tube sampler is important to obtain high quality sample. In addition, the existence of a piston does not have a significant effect on the strength properties. The recompression technique in the triaxial test, where the specimen is consolidated back to the in situ stresses, was able to duplicate undisturbed soil behavior except when the structure of a soil sample was significantly destroyed. The unconfined compressive strength is apparently governed by the residual effective stress. From the two types of tests simulating sampling processes, however, it was found that a reduction in the unconfined compressive strengths of low quality sample was brought by the loss of the residual effective stress as well as destruction of soil structures.

Butterfield R.	An improved model of soil response to load, unload and re-load cycles in an oedometer	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	2		253	263			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84866688149&partnerID=40&md5=d31dd71e9c3d1a3f0c5d3166495d84e0	University of Southampton, United Kingdom	Butterfield, R., University of Southampton, United Kingdom	There are a number of advantages to be gained by representing the oedometric compression of a soil skeleton, during virgin loading, unloading and subsequent reloading by 'log (v) versus log (p')' relationships rather than the conventional 'e versus log 10 (p')' expression. The paper presents an augmented version of the basic, two parameter (C' c, C' s), 'log (v) versus log (p')' model in which the addition of two further parameters (C' r, C' o) enables a complete, nonlinear response for any load-unload-reload cycle to be reproduced. All four parameters, deduced from a single such cycle in an oedometer, can then be used to predict the response of the sample in any other unload-reload cycles. Results are presented from tests of this kind on a range of fine-grained soils to demonstrate the key attributes of the model. These include the generation of 'log (m v) versus log (p')' diagrams that furnish practically useful m v values applicable throughout any unload-reload cycle. The model also provides a simple means of assessing the overconsolidation ratio of an undisturbed soil sample.

In the method the raft is modelled as a thin plate, and the piles and the soil are treated as interactive springs. Both the resistances of the piles as well as the raft base are incorporated into the model. Pile-soil-pile interaction, pile-soil-raft interaction and raft-soil-raft interaction are taken into account based on Mindlin's solutions. The proposed method makes it possible to solve problems of large non-uniformly arranged piled rafts in a time-saving way using a PC. The method can also be used for the deformation analysis of pile groups by setting the soil resistance at the raft base equal to zero. The validity of the proposed method is verified through comparisons with existing solutions. Two case studies on settlement analyses of a free-standing pile group and a large piled raft are presented. In the analyses, applicability of the equivalent pier concept is also examined and discussed. The computed settlements compare favourably with the field measurements.

A new model for unsaturated soil using skeleton stress and degree of saturation as state variables	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	1		67	81		6	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-79960293141&partnerID=40&md5=fbd1edd46530ea012b33eab8a6cbbdbc	Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan; Nippon Koei Company, Tokyo, Japan	Zhang, F., Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan; Ikariya, T., Nippon Koei Company, Tokyo, Japan	In this paper, based on experimental results a new constitutive model, using skeleton stress and degree of saturation as independent state variables, is proposed for unsaturated soil, in which the influence of the degree of saturation can be properly described. In the model, a very simple moisture characteristics curve considering moisture hysteresis of unsaturated soil is also proposed. The moisture characteristics curve can not only be applied to secondary drying process but also primary drying process originated from slurry soil. The constitutive model is able to describe not only the behavior of unsaturated soil but also saturated soil because the skeleton stress can smoothly shift to effective stress if saturation changes from unsaturated condition to saturated condition. Meanwhile the overconsolidation, one of the main features of soils that are discussed in the models for saturated soils, is also considered together with the degree of saturation. Other mechanical features such as structure of soil and stress-induced anisotropy can be easily incorporated into the proposed model within the framework of the present research. It is known from the simulation that the main features of unsaturated soil in isotropic consolidation test and triaxial compression test under drained and exhausted condition with different confining stress and suction can be qualitatively described.

On the particle size distribution of a basaltic till	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	1		113	121			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84859794177&partnerID=40&md5=f4d22689c59397451fc7fa37ed47f789	Imperial College London, United Kingdom; Department of Soil Mechanics, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Department of Ice and Rock Physics, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong	Altuhafi, F., Imperial College London, United Kingdom; Baudet, B.A., Department of Soil Mechanics, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Sammonds, P., Department of Ice and Rock Physics, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong	Stress and strain history play a major role in defining the final grading of a soil, and by studying how the particle size distribution of a soil evolves with stress and strain it may be possible to highlight some important aspects of the sediment past history. In this paper, the characteristics and evolution of the grading of a till from Iceland, so-called Langjö kull sediment, are examined. Specimens of the till were tested in compression (triaxial, oedometer tests) to very high pressures, and in shearing (triaxial, ring shear tests) to very high strains. The change in grading corresponding to particle breakage during compression and shearing was monitored using sieve analysis and scanning electron microscopy. The results show that the particle size distribution of the till, which is well graded, does not evolve when the till is subjected to high stresses or strains. Additional tests on specimens made of the larger-sized till particles didhowever show signs of breakage during testing. This suggests that the current natural grading of the till was achieved by incessant shearing during its past history, and corresponds to an ultimate, critical grading. This is confirmed by the mineralogical analysis of the sediment, which highlights a single parent rock and weathering of the particles by mechanical processes only.

In this paper, a large-scale physical model test was conducted in order to investigate the behavior of a small dam embankment as water levels rose. The test results were simulated by use of a consolidation analysis method coupled with an elastoplastic model for unsaturated soils. All parameters used in the simulation were obtained from element tests; oedometer, triaxial compression, soil water retention, and permeability tests. First, in order to verify the parameters identified, direct shear tests were simulated using the consolidation analysis method; results of the simulation and the tests were consistent. From the embankment model test it was found that the crest of the embankment moved upstream at the first stage of impounding and then moved back. After a seepage surface appeared on the downstream slope, tension cracks occurred on the downstream slope, and sliding occurred through the crack and the downstream toe. The results of the simulation were consistent with those of the model test. This consolidation analysis method could be used to simulate the complex deformations induced by saturation collapse and shear strains and even failure behavior. Old embankments constructed with loose densities might have histories in which cracks occurred on the downstream slopes when the reservoir water level rose, and their stabilities might have decreased.

This paper presents yielding behavior and non-coaxiality of Toyoura sand obtained from the tests. The stress probing tests consist of ten series of shearing tests each of which starts from systematically chosen individual initial stress point. Each initial stress point is subjected to load-unload stress history. The yielding characteristic is interpreted by means of a concept of multiple yield surfaces model which has three yield surfaces representing linearly elastic behavior limit, commencement point of rapid development in plastic strain and elasto-plastic range. As a result, an experimental evidence of the isotropic hardening, i.e., isotropic expansion of yield surface, induced by anisotropic loadings is obtained. This is what was tacitly assumed in the application of plastic flow rules. However, misalignment of directions between principal stress and principal plastic strain increment is observed. Moreover, plastic strain increment direction is found to be influenced by the given stress increment direction. These facts suggest the non-coaxiality between stress and plastic strain increment due to shear stress increment, even during monotonic loading with isotropic hardening. The plastic strain increment direction diverges from the normal direction to a surface which is a circle with its center nearly at the origin on p′-constant plane and which passes through the current stress point.

Mobilization, transport and deposition of soil colloids are the underlying processes governing colloid-facilitated contaminant transport. Although significant progress has been made in simulating mobilization and transport/deposition of model colloids in different collector systems, it may be inadequate for the prediction of natural colloidal behavior in the subsurface. This study quantifies the leaching of natural volcanic ash soil colloids (NC) as well as the simultaneous transport of applied water dispersible soil colloids (WDC) in aggregated volcanic ash soil columns. Two water-saturated soil columns were irrigated with artificial irrigation water (AIW) at an intensity of 80 mm/hr for 60 hours. Two additional columns were irrigated at the same intensity, but a colloidal suspension of 5 mg/L was applied after 20 hours for a period of 20 hours. EOEuent colloid concentrations were measured in each experiment. HYDRUS-1D was used for the simulation and estimation of colloid transport parameters. The results clearly showed different kinetics for applied colloid transport and natural colloid leaching. Transport of applied WDC followed first-order attachment kinetics, while the two-site equilibrium/kinetic model with equal fractions of equilibrium and kinetic sites best described the leaching of NC. Coupling these best model approaches well predicted the simultaneous leaching of natural and applied colloids, hereby providing a useful tool for the design of colloidbased in-situ soil remediation systems.

In the site studied here, large residual settlement of as much as 70 cm has already occurred in the 4 years since it entered into service. It is believed that settlement will also continue in the future because excess pore pressure is still present within the clay layers. Furthermore, according to the method of evaluation proposed previously by the authors, which is based on the sensitivity and compression index ratios, it can be judged that the ground includes clays that are sensitive to disturbance and have a strong possibility of large residual settlement. In this paper, simulation of the settlement observed up to now at the site as well as prediction of the settlement that could occur in the future was carried out by deducing the higher compressibilities possessed by the in-situ clays compared with the undisturbed clay specimens in the laboratory. The soil-water coupled finite deformation analysis was employed using the analysis program GEOASIA, in which the constitutive equation for the soil skeleton is mounted with the SYS Cam-clay model. In addition, the effect of modifying the vertical section of the embankment by overlaying in order to counter the settlement was also investigated by numerical analysis. The results showed that such a countermeasure cannot be expected to lead to faster consolidation and that it may require massive funding over a long period of time to cover the maintenance and management costs involved.

The proposed method introduces the characterization of the stress-strain behavior that eliminates unnecessary experimental cost due to uncertainty in the design stress path. For arbitrary control of the effective stress during consolidation, a technique of back-pressure equalization, which enforces the immediate drained condition on the soil specimen without change of the effective stress state, was used. To account for nonlinear anisotropic response in computing the consolidation strains, the iteration procedure was designed. For the proposed method, the stress path experiments on the normally consolidated kaolin were conducted. An example illustrating the feasibility of proposed method in precisely calculating the settlement is shown for a circular footing on the clay stratum.

The rate-dependency of stress-strain behaviour due to the viscous property of clay was investigated by 1D compression tests on standard-size specimens by various loading methods: 1) Standard Consolidation Tests (SCTs), stepwise increasing the axial stress two times every one day; 2) ordinary Constant-Rateof- Strain (CRS) tests at different strain rates; 3) special CRS tests including unloading and reloading cycles with different stress amplitudes at strain rates of which the absolute value was either kept constant throughout respective tests or changed at the start of reloading; and 4) special CRS tests including a number of sustained loading (SL) during otherwise primary loading or unloading or reloading at constant strain rate. Sufficiently low strain rates were employed to ensure essentially fully drained condition. The followings were found. Despite that the newly developed pneumatic loading system is rather simple, 1D compression tests following such various loading histories as above can be performed on four types of clay rather accurately. The stress-strain behaviour of clay is significantly rate-dependent, exhibiting significant creep strains at SL stages. The creep strain rate is significantly different whether SL starts during otherwise primary loading or unloading or reloading, controlled by the magnitude and sign of the initial strain rate at the start of SL. The whole observed trends of rate-dependent stress-strain behaviour can be qualitatively explained by the non-linear three-component elasto-viscoplastic model extended to cyclic loading conditions.

As SGM is mainly used at levels below the ground water table, water permeability and absorption properties of SGM will affect the durability of the material. In this research, the changes in SGM permeability and absorption as functions of the air foam fraction were investigated. First, permeability tests with triaxial apparatus and constant rate of consolidation tests were conducted on samples containing less than 10% of air foam by volume. From the results, air foam was found to be an impermeable medium in SGM. Secondly, a series of permeability tests and absorption tests were conducted for the SGM with different fractions of air foam while observing the specimen with a micro focus X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) scanner. The results showed that the permeability of SGM increased dramatically due to the appearance of interior water channels when the air foam fraction exceeded 30% by volume. The density distribution change and water absorbed zones of the specimens during absorption tests were estimated using the X-ray CT data. From these results, the air in the SGM was found to be progressively substituted with water from the surface to the inside of the specimen and the substituted zone expanded as it made its way to the specimen interior. The expansion velocity of the substituted zone was not affected by the coeffcient of permeability but by the fraction of the air in the specimen.

The wave was generated using a multi-layered piezoelectric actuator attached to the top cap of a triaxial cell specimen and received with two piezoelectrical accelerometers at two different positions on the specimen's side. This system includes use of a peak to peak travel time based on excitation records that were triggered by single pulse or sinusoidal wave and stacked for 128 times. The vertical Young's moduli (E d) obtained by using this dynamic measurement were then compared with the statically measured vertical Young's moduli (E s) that were evaluated by conducting small unloading/reloading cycles on the same specimen. Two series of tests using medium and large size specimens, respectively, were conducted on three kinds of material namely Toyoura sand (D 50=0.23 mm), sieved Chiba gravel (D 50=3 mm) and original Chiba gravel (D 50=6 mm). No significant effect of specimen size was observed on E s and E d of Toyoura sand. E d was found larger than E s in all three types of materials while the difference between the two was not the same. Combined effects of the dry density and the wavelength in the dynamic measurement were then discussed.

Study of strain localization and microstructural changes in partially saturated sand during triaxial tests using microfocus X-ray CT	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	1		95	111		1	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84859790476&partnerID=40&md5=5d4d4929434ffcf64d26e57368a05236	Department of Civil and Earth Resources Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Railway Technical Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan	Higo, Y., Department of Civil and Earth Resources Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Oka, F., Department of Civil and Earth Resources Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Kimoto, S., Department of Civil and Earth Resources Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Sanagawa, T., Department of Civil and Earth Resources Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, Railway Technical Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan; Matsushima, Y., Department of Civil and Earth Resources Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan	It is well known that strain localization and microstructural changes are important issues in the onset of failure problems. In particular, unsaturated soil exhibits more brittle failure due to the collapse of the water meniscus, caused by shearing or the infiltration of water, than saturated soil. The aim of this paper is to observe the strain localization behavior and the microstructural changes in partially saturated soil during the deformation process using microfocus Xray CT. The microfocus X-ray CT system employed in this study has a very high spatial resolution of 5 mm, which is enough to visualize the sand particles and the other particles individually. In addition, X-ray CT scans can be performed under triaxial conditions. The strain localization of fully saturated, partially saturated, and air-dried sand specimens during triaxial compression tests is observed and discussed. The microstructure of unsaturated soil, consisting of soil particles, pore water, and pore air, is successfully observed in partial CT scans. Through a comparison of the microstructures in the shear bands and in the initial state, the microstructural changes are discussed.

Field performance of PVD combined with reinforced embankment on peaty ground	2011	Soils and Foundations	51	1		191	201			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84859804228&partnerID=40&md5=048cea9e2ffdee7ecc8169034c750c32	Civil Engineering Research Institute for Cold Region, Sapporo, Japan	Hayashi, H., Civil Engineering Research Institute for Cold Region, Sapporo, Japan; Nishimoto, S., Civil Engineering Research Institute for Cold Region, Sapporo, Japan; Takahashi, M., Civil Engineering Research Institute for Cold Region, Sapporo, Japan	This paper describes the field performance of prefabricated vertical drains (PVD) used in combination with reinforced embankments on peaty ground. A large-scale field test of PVD adopted in combination with an embankment reinforced using galvanized steel grid was conducted on peaty ground in Hokkaido, Japan. Although the site was characterized by extremely soft peaty ground, a stable, high embankment 11.8 m in thickness was successfully constructed through the combination method. A consolidation-accelerating improvement from the PVD and a reinforcement effect from the steel grid were clearly observed, and settlement of the PVD-improved peat layer corresponded roughly with Barron's solution with consideration to well resistance. However, it was necessary to make the coeffcient of consolidation nine times as large as that seen in the results of oedometer testing. The surcharge embankment allowed a reduction of the coeffcient of secondary consolidation for the overconsolidated peat layer (overconsolidation ratio: approx. 1.13) to approximately 60z that of the normal consolidated layer.

Without Mg 2+, calcite was produced using only CaCl 2, while the presence of Mg produced Mg-calcite, magnesite and/or possibly dolomite of round, spherical or fibrous shapes, depending on reaction time, pH and Mg/Ca ratio. The carbonate produced contributed to the development of cementation for sands. The presence of Mg showed a relatively strong cementation of the carbonate.

In this research, a series of experiments was conducted for the purpose of developing a method to measure the degree of saturation of ground by digital image processing. From photo images taken at various soil moisture contents, the colors of the images were converted into numerical values which were then related to known degrees of saturation. The results of the experiments showed that a method to measure the degree of saturation of ground by image processing was possible. The relation between degree of saturation and luminance value can be expressed in terms of second degree function. Good results were obtained for two soil samples with different colors and grain size distributions. The margin of error was in the order of ±5% . The method was validated through vertical seepage tests, where good agreements were obtained between the measured degrees of saturation by tensiometers and those estimated from the proposed method. The method illustrates the possibility of measuring the degree of saturation of a larger portion of the ground, which is difficult to perform using conventional procedures.With this method, contour diagrams of degree of saturation can be produced, making it possible to visualize the propagation of the saturated region.

However, the impact of the pore fluids on the geotechnical properties of the samples is even more dependent on the type of mineral and interlayer ions. Completely different behaviours could be observed with identical pore fluids but different clay minerals and vice versa. The liquid limit, plastic limit and undrained shear strength were determined for two types of smectites with different interlayer cations, namely Ca and Na-smectite. The pore fluids were varied by using different dielectric constants (e) and electrolyte concentrations (n0). The results show that the two kinds of soils respond in a similar way but with a different magnitude depending on the ion occupation.

A numerical model for unsaturated soil was constructed based on the mixture theory and an elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model. The theory used in the analysis is a generalization of Biot's two-phase mixture theory for saturated soil. An air-soil-water coupled finite element method was developed using the governing equations for three-phase soil based on the nonlinear finite deformation theory, i.e., the updated Lagrangian method. Two-dimensional numerical analyses of the river embankment under seepage conditions were conducted, and the deformation associated with the seepage flow was studied.We have found that the occurrence of large deformations corresponds to the large values of the hydraulic gradients at the toe of the embankment, and that the overflow of river water makes the embankment more unstable. It has been confirmed that seepage-deformation coupled three-phase behavior can be simulated well with the proposed method.

Using model ground comprised of Toyoura sand reconstituted by air-pluviation method, a series of cyclic loading tests on model structures under several foundation conditions was conducted at a loading pattern which is capable of simulating the various stress states induced by both oscillation of structure and wave force. Test results showed that the strength and deformation characteristics of model sand deposits are basically identical to those estimated from the conventional cyclic undrained triaxial test and are different depending strongly on the changes in the depositional condition of the ground. Based on the results of model testing, the applicability of countermeasures constructed by both side wall and sheet pile was investigated to prevent ground failure. Considering the model testing results, it was also found that the installation of side walls beneath structures and sheet piles into the ground are advantageous as countermeasures against progressive failure on sand ground subjected to wave loading.

Behavior of large scale underground cavern located in jointed rock masses evaluated by using distinct element method	2010	Soils and Foundations	50	5		609	621		2	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84862909053&partnerID=40&md5=6f283ed5878be209c3d216a31a4f61c3	Faculty of Engineering, Nagasaki University, Japan; Research Center for Geo-Environmental Science, Dalian University, China; Kyushu Electric Power Co., Inc., Japan	Li, B., Faculty of Engineering, Nagasaki University, Japan; Jiang, Y., Faculty of Engineering, Nagasaki University, Japan, Research Center for Geo-Environmental Science, Dalian University, China; Tanabashi, Y., Faculty of Engineering, Nagasaki University, Japan; Yamashita, Y., Kyushu Electric Power Co., Inc., Japan	The stability and support effects of large-scale underground caverns located in jointed rock masses are principally ruled by the mechanical behavior of discontinuities. The major deformations of the host rock masses containing underground caverns originate from the normal and shear movements among the walls of discontinuities. Therefore, in the numerical simulations of the deformation behavior of underground structures, how to accurately model the discontinuities becomes a key problem. In this study, a 2-D distinct element code, UDEC, was used to analyze the deformation behavior of an underground cavern of a pumped storage power plant, based on in-situ geological data. The validity of numerical simulation was evaluated by comparing the numerical results with the site measurement data at two cross-sections of the cavern. Some local deformation behavior of the cavern affected by the characteristics of discontinuity distributions was discussed. The influences of cross-sectional shape of the cavern and the orientation of initial ground stress on the performance of cavern were evaluated. The simulation results revealed that the orientation, position and density of discontinuities as well as the cross-sectional shape of a carven influences its deformation behavior and stability significantly.

The reason why most of the reviewed papers are concentrated in Soils and Foundations is that if we were to include papers appearing in other journals in the field of geotechnical engineering, closely related to numerical methods, e.g., Computers and Geotechnics, Int. J. Numer. Anal. Meth. Geomech., etc., we would have to deal with almost all the papers in those journals. Firstly, we present a description of the current status of the numerical methods, and then give a brief review of the literature covering several topics in geotechnical applications. The scope of the review is limited, and thus, the authors do not profess to cover the entire range of literature.

In order to confirm the effectiveness of the application of pile foundation to reinforced soil structures by geogrid for improvement of the lateral resistance of the structure and to investigate the interaction between pile and reinforced soil structure, a dynamic centrifuge model test (25 G) was carried out. Two geogrid reinforced soil, one with piles and one without, were used in a countermeasure to reduce the deformation of a road embankment built on a slope in the event of an earthquake, and the effectiveness of the pile foundation to the reinforced soil structure was considered with regard to it affected the road surface. The details and the results of the dynamic centrifuge model test, as well as the interaction between pile and reinforced soil structure are described, and the effectiveness of the application of pile foundation to reinforced soil structure is discussed in this paper.

Effect of gapping on the transient and sustained uplift capacity of a shallow skirted foundation in clay	2010	Soils and Foundations	50	5		725	735		4	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84855856099&partnerID=40&md5=60d7008b24197ed71672de72627dee8e	AECOM Australia Pty Ltd., Australia; Centre for Offshore Foundation Systems, University of Western Australia, Australia	Acosta-Martinez, H.E., AECOM Australia Pty Ltd., Australia; Gourvenec, S.M., Centre for Offshore Foundation Systems, University of Western Australia, Australia; Randolph, M.F., Centre for Offshore Foundation Systems, University of Western Australia, Australia	Shallow skirted foundations are an attractive solution for supporting offshore platforms that are subject to uplift due to overturning or buoyancy loading. In practice, gapping may occur along the skirt-soil interface leading to a detrimental effect on uplift capacity. This paper presents results from beam centrifuge tests that investigated the effect of gapping on the transient and sustained uplift capacity of shallow skirted foundations. The results indicate that the transient uplift capacity following the formation of a gap was around 60z of that for intact soil contact along the skirt-soil interface. Under sustained uplift, the time to accumulate a displacement of 1z of the foundation diameter was reduced by an order of magnitude due to the presence of a gap.

LIQSEDFLOW: Role of two-phase physics in subaqueous sediment gravity flows	2010	Soils and Foundations	50	4		495	504		1	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-82955164396&partnerID=40&md5=ade609b0445ee1f488d24b783506965d	Port and Airport Research Institute, Yokosuka, Japan; Graduate School of Science, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan	Sassa, S., Port and Airport Research Institute, Yokosuka, Japan; Sekiguchi, H., Graduate School of Science, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan	The paper describes an extension of the computational code LIQSEDFLOW proposed by the authors. The salient features of the code lie in its capability to describe the multi-phased physics of subaqueous sediment gravity flows. Specifically, it combines Navier-Stokes/continuity equations and equations for the advection and hindered settling of grains for a liquefied soil domain, with a consolidation equation for the underlying, progressively solidifying soil domain via a transition layer characterized by zero eŠective stress and a small yet discernible stiŠness. Evolutions of the flow and solidification surfaces are traced as part of the solution using a volume-of-fluid (VOF) technique. The predicted features of the gravity flows of initially fluidized sediments with diŠerent concentrations conform to the observed performances in two-dimensional flume tests. The present results demonstrate the crucial role of two-phase physics, particularly solidification, in reproducing the concurrent processes of flow stratification, deceleration, and redeposition in subaqueous sediment gravity flows.

Full-scale embankment consolidation test using prefabricated vertical thermal drains	2010	Soils and Foundations	50	5		599	608		3	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-79551576892&partnerID=40&md5=14bd5d6117a7f431a716ebbc1b5243c5	School of Civil Engineering, Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand	Pothiraksanon, C., School of Civil Engineering, Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand; Bergado, D.T., School of Civil Engineering, Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand; Abuel-Naga, H.M., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand	In this study the field feasibility of an innovative thermal technique to improve the performance of prefabricated vertical drains (PVD) used in conjunction with the preloading ground improvement method is investigated. For this purpose, two identical 6.0 m high full-scale test embankments for preloading were constructed over the soft Bangkok clay where a conventional PVD system was installed underneath one embankment and a novel prefabricated vertical thermo-drain (PVTD) system was utilized for the other. The PVTD unit consists of a U-tube made of cross-linked polyethylene plastic (PEX) that is attached to a conventional PVD unit. Preheated water at about 909C is circulated through the attached U-tube to raise the soil temperature underneath the PVTD embankment. The behavior of the two test embankments were compared in terms of excess pore water pressure and consolidation results. The comparison shows the advantage of a PVTD system over a conventional PVD system. The rate of consolidation increases significantly in the PVTD system due to the temperature effect on the hydraulic conductivity. Moreover, the embankment with the PVTD system generates more settlement due to the thermally induced irreversible contraction of saturated normally consolidated soft Bangkok clay.

Particle breakage results in an increase in the number of fine particles and broadens the grading of particle sizes, and the primary eŠect of broadening the grading is to lower the critical state line and other characteristics of the volumetric response in the compression plane. In our study, an existing constitutive model, the Severn-Trent sand model, in which the critical state line plays a central role as the locus of asymptotic states, has been extended to include the eŠects of particle breakage. Severn-Trent sand is a frictional hardening Mohr-Coulomb model described within a kinematic hardening, bounding surface framework. The central assumption is that strength is seen as a variable quantity, dependent on the current value of the state parameter (volumetric distance from the critical state line) which varies with changes in density and stress levels. If the critical state line falls as a result of broadening grading, the state parameter tends to increase and the soil feels looser.

The numerical modeling consists of two processes. The first is to get the mechanical properties of synthetic specimens composed of circular rigid elements with the bonded eŠect between elements. The second is to analyze deformation of a reduced-scale rock slope under the gravity increased condition. With the calibrated properties of the synthetic specimen unchanged, an approach to initialize stress state in the slope model is studied. Evolution of displacements and the resulting initiation of failure surface in the slope model are displayed.

The specimens were prepared using an automatic compaction system while measuring quantitatively the compaction energy. For the evaluation of small strain stiffness, a static technique using small cyclic vertical loading with local strain measurement and a dynamic technique using P-wave measurement were employed. It was revealed that the peak strength of compacted gravel increased in a non-linear manner with the increase in the compaction energy. On the other hand, the difference between statically and dynamically measured small strain Young's moduli was reduced as a result of increase in the compaction energy. The peak strengths of three almost equally dense specimens were found similar to each other irrespective of the difference in the loading histories with/without large cyclic loading. However, the values of the axial strain at the peak stress state were different among the three specimens, affected by the different loading histories.

Kawamura K.	Burial consolidation processes of deep-sea sediments: An example of core sediments collected from the Labrador Sea in the northwest Atlantic	2010	Soils and Foundations	50	5		623	632			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84855838764&partnerID=40&md5=107c17d9c540ad740e1141444f37c50e	Fukada Geological Institute, Tokyo, Japan	Kawamura, K., Fukada Geological Institute, Tokyo, Japan	Progressive change of microfabrics of deep-sea sediments during early diagenesis was analyzed using two drill cores collected from the Sites U1305 and U1306 of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 303 in the Labrador Sea in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. Microfabrics were analyzed by scanning electron microscope and deduced from anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility. Different microfabrics in three layers were distinguished in both cores: Surface layer with general void ratio >2.5, subjacent layer with void ratio 2.5-1.5, and deep layer with void ratio <1.5. Microfabrics of the sediments change downward (toward deeper part), as well as magnetic susceptibility anisotropy. Microfabrics in the surface layer are non-directional and characterized by the presence of many macropores larger than 10 μm in diameter. Clay platelets in this layer are linked to each other with edge-to-edge or high-angle edge-toface (EF) contact. In the underlying layer, contact relations of clay platelets change to low angle EF type. Coarse siliciclastic fractions of this layer show horizontal preferred orientation, most probably due to overloading of the surface layer. Sizes of macropores decrease to several mm in diameter. In the lowest layer, clay platelets take horizontal preferred orientation according to further burial consolidation. Thus, the microfabrics of the sediments are developed from non-directional to preferred horizontal orientation with burial consolidation by following processes; 1) rotation of coarse grains in the layer with the void ratio>2.5 and 2) change of clay microfabrics in the layer with the void ratio <2.5.

(1994), has been developed to simulate large deformations and failure evolution involving diŠerent material phases in a single computational domain. A continuum body is divided into a finite number of subregions represented by Lagrangian material points, while the governing equations are formulated and solved with the Eulerian grid. Since this grid can be chosen arbitrarily, mesh tangling does not appear in the MPM. To design a simple but robust spatial discretization procedure, the MPM is coupled with the finite diŠerence method (FDM) in the present study for simulating fully and partially saturated elasto-plastic soil responses based on the simplified three-phase method. Governing equations for the soil skeleton and the pore fluid are discretized by the MPM and FDM, respectively. Soil-water coupled analyses for fully saturated soils and seepage-deformation coupled analyses for unsaturated soils are performed, and the potential of the proposed method is demonstrated via numerical examples.

Inclinodeformometer for earth pressure measurements in creeping landslides	2010	Soils and Foundations	50	4		451	458		2	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-82955164405&partnerID=40&md5=79c340f47d7dad5d55b85c43b7f9805e	Institute for Geotechnical Engineering, Switzerland	Schwager, M.V., Institute for Geotechnical Engineering, Switzerland; Schmid, A.M., Institute for Geotechnical Engineering, Switzerland; Puzrin, A.M., Institute for Geotechnical Engineering, Switzerland	The inclinodeformometer (IDM) is a novel device for measuring changes in earth pressure in a sliding layer of a creeping landslide. The device makes use of existing and widely used inclinometer measurement technology. The change of earth pressure in the sliding layer leads to changes in the shape and dimensions of the incinometer pipe. Careful measurements of these changes make it possible to backcalculate the pressure increment from the solution of a boundary value problem with properly described constitutive behaviors of the pipe and surrounding soil. An advantage of the inclinodeformometer is that it does not require any additional infrastructure than standard inclinometer pipes, even long after they are sheared and became unsuitable for inclinometer measurements. Full scale laboratory tests performed in a 2 m high calibration chamber demonstrated that simple constitutive models can be used for back-calculation as a first approximation. Initial field measurements performed on the St.Moritz landslide confirmed the existence of a compression zone in this constrained creeping landslide, and gave an order of magnitude for the pressure increment. This confirms the shear strength on the sliding surface decreased over time, implying that Brattas landslide in St. Moritz has to be analyzed considering a potential failure scenario.

Lade P.V., Karimpour H.	Static fatigue controls particle crushing and time effects in granular materials	2010	Soils and Foundations	50	5		573	583		5	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-79951778387&partnerID=40&md5=0b82ed79f3bb6622765b404cd42aa3f3	Department of Civil Engineering, Catholic University of America, Washington, DC, United States	Lade, P.V., Department of Civil Engineering, Catholic University of America, Washington, DC, United States; Karimpour, H., Department of Civil Engineering, Catholic University of America, Washington, DC, United States	Based on observations from constant strain rate experiments and from creep and stress relaxation experiments initiated at different stress levels it is found that sand exhibits patterns of time effects different from those observed in clays. It appears that time effects in sand may be associated with crushing of particles, and a mechanistic picture of time effects in granular materials is constructed in which time effects depend on interparticle friction, grain crushing and grain rearrangement. This mechanistic picture is based on measured behavior in drained triaxial compression tests on three different sands in which strain rate effects are observed as small to negligible. While creep and relaxation are caused by the same underlying phenomenon, it appears that results of creep tests cannot be obtained from results of relaxations tests, and vice versa. The phenomenon of static fatigue of individual particles seems to be at the root of time effects in sand. A review of previous studies of static fatigue is presented. Triaxial tests on a beach sand incorporating creep and stress relaxation are followed by grain size analysis to prove that grain crushing relate to the observed time effects. Additional triaxial tests are presented in which the effect of water is demonstrated in support of the static fatigue mechanism. Load-controlled tests on individual sand particles in the form of spherical glass beads (quartz) were performed by maintaining constant loads lower than the short term crushing loads. As do rock and concrete specimens in triaxial compression, the glass beads show effects of time to crushing.

In the theoretical simulation, based on conventional drained triaxial compression tests and undrained triaxial cyclic loading tests. the material parameters of TSS are determined. By using the uniquely determined material parameters, other tests under different loadings and drainage conditions are simulated by the constitutive model. The capability of the model to describe uniquely the overall behaviors of the sand under different drainage conditions and different loadings with one set of fixed parameters is verified.

The phenomenon of piping results from the erosion of soil particles and their transport within a soil mass. In this paper, a numerical method is proposed to analyze the erosion within soils and the transport of eroded soil particles by adopting the concept of the erosion rate of soils. In such an analysis, the saturated-unsaturated seepage flow of the pore liquid, the detachment of the soil particles from the soil fabric, and the migration of the eroded particles are taken into consideration, and the equations related to the conservation of the pore liquid and the eroded soil particles are numerically solved. This numerical simulation allows for the procurement of the temporal alteration and the spatial distribution of the porosity, the particle size distribution, and the concentration of the detached soil particles in the pore liquid, as well as the distribution of pore liquid pressure. The results have revealed that the method can reproduce the experimental data from previous studies on the internal erosion of soils and that it qualitatively predicts, from the numerical experiments, the typical development of piping within soils, such as soil blocks and embankments, as the solutions to the initial and the boundary value problems of the governing equations.

Nail reinforcement mechanism of cohesive soil slopes under earthquake conditions	2010	Soils and Foundations	50	4		459	469		9	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-79954860595&partnerID=40&md5=69d5ac6f83338e45e916bf12657678c2	State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China	Wang, L., State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Zhang, G., State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Zhang, J.-M., State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China	Soil nails have been widely used to retain excavations and stabilize steep cutslopes. A series of dynamic centrifuge model tests were conducted on nail-reinforced and unreinforced slopes during an earthquake, with several influence factors, including the nail length, nail spacing, and the inclination of slope, taken into consideration. The unreinforced slope exhibited a progressive failure in the middle and lower parts though the global slip surface did not appear due to the earthquake, which was arrested by using the nail reinforcement. The nails changed the dynamic acceleration response of the slope during the earthquake. The deformation of the slope was significantly decreased by the nails within a nail-influence zone. This zone involved the slip surface of the unreinforced slope, and was almost completely independent on the layout of the nail-reinforcement when the nails had sufficient length. A point couple analysis, a strain analysis, and a uniformity analysis were carried out in an attempt to determine why nails can increase the stability of a slope. It was discovered that the nails forced the deformation of the slope to be more uniform and thus arrested possible strain localization under earthquake conditions. As such, it is suggested that increasing nail length or decreasing nail spacing can both improve the nail-reinforcement eŠect, and increase the stability level of a slope.

From an engineering point of view, the latter can be much more dangerous because the sliding mass may continue moving until it collides with another object. If a catastrophic failure occurs near a river, the debris may block the river, causing serious damage to the adjacent area. Therefore, examination of the mechanism of such catastrophic slope failures is important with respect to the mitigation of earthquake disasters in mountainous districts, although numerical modeling of such phenomena is rather difficult. In the present study, a new numerical model is developed to simulate an earthquake-induced catastrophic landslide that occured at a typical dip slope, namely, the Yokowatashi Landslide in Japan. In this case, the upper part of the bedrock on the planer tectonic dip surface slid more than 70 m. Only shear-strength degradation at the bedding plane could cause such a long-distance traveling failure. To investigate the strain-softening characteristics of the materials that filled the bedding plane, a series of laboratory tests involving undisturbed block samples was performed. The measured stress-displacement relationships under cyclic loading were numerically modeled as a newly proposed elastoplastic constitutive model to be used in numerical simulations of landslide, based on the dynamic finite element method. The observed phenomena were appropriately simulated by the proposed method. The mechanism of catastrophic failure is discussed in detail in this paper in order to clarify the relationships between the strain-softening characteristics and the global slope stability. Our newly proposed method to evaluate the possibility of a catastrophic failure was applied to the landslide, and the moment when the slope becomes unstable was able to be predicted. The results confirm that the proposed method can predict the catastrophic failure of a slope.

An increase in pile capacity with time is known as setup, whereas a decrease in capacity is referred to as relaxation. In this paper, we review the current understanding of pile setup and discuss how to account for it in design. A total of forty-three dynamic tests were conducted over a period of five months on four H piles and four closed-ended pipe piles driven into layered soil. Test results show that the amount and rate of pile setup are quite different from those observed in other studies. Empirical formulas for predicting setup proposed by several researchers were compared with observations. Of the empirical formulas considered, the Svinkin (1996) lower-bound method predicted the rate of setup on these piles driven in layered soil relatively well. Additionally, some theoretical methods for prediction of evolution of static pile bearing capacity with time were tested against the dynamic pile test results. The bearing capacity from these theoretical methods was found to correspond to approximately 2 times the capacity measured at the end of initial driving by a dynamic test.

Model walls having a height of about 50 cm were placed on a subsoil layer and backfilled with a layer of dense dry Toyoura sand. They were subjected to several steps of horizontal irregular excitations. As a result, generation of negative pore air pressure in the backfill was observed. The maximum amplitude of the negative pore air pressure during each shaking step increased with the base acceleration. Based on analyses of the measured data, it was inferred that such negative pore air pressure was caused by outward wall displacement relative to the backfill and not by dilative behavior of the backfill. It would cause a reduction in the seismic earth pressures exerted from the backfill. This feature suggests an advantage of a rigid full-height facing for reinforced soil walls over the segmental types of facing. A simplified numerical procedure to evaluate earth pressure was applied while considering the effects of the negative pore air pressure, and it could qualitatively simulate the measured behavior in terms of the seismic earth pressure and the angle of failure plane in the backfill.

Tests were performed at constant void ratio, constant relative density and constant sand skeleton void ratio, for a variety of fines contents. Instead of looking at the direct effect of fines content on the cyclic response of the sand-fine mixtures, a novel approach of analysing the cyclic test data is proposed, by normalising these data with respect to state. The important difference with other similar work on plain sand is that the reference line for normalising must take account of the fines content. Simple definitions of equivalent void ratio, which take account of fines content, have been used. The results presented indicate that state plays an important role in defining the cyclic resistance ratio and pore water pressure generation during cyclic loading.

These effects cannot be taken into account in the conventional pseudo-static based limit equilibrium analyses or Newmark's rigid sliding block analogy, which are usually adopted as the seismic design procedure. Therefore, this study attempts to develop a simplified procedure to evaluate earthquake-induced residual displacement of GRS walls by reflecting the knowledge on the seismic behaviors of GRS walls obtained from the shaking table model tests. In the proposed method, 1) the deformation characteristics of subsoil and backfill are modeled based on the model test results and 2) the effect of failure plane formation is considered by using residual soil strength after the failure plane formation while the peak soil strength is used before the failure plane formation, and 3) the effect of the pullout resistance mobilized by the reinforcement is also introduced by evaluating the pullout resistance based on the results from the pullout tests of the reinforcements. By using the proposed method, simulations were performed on the shaking table model test results conducted under a wide variety of testing conditions and good agreements between the calculated and measured displacements were observed.

Ltd., Japan	Ageing effects on the elasto-viscoplastic property of compacted moist cement-mixed granular material (GM) were evaluated by performing a series of non-standard drained triaxial compression (TC) tests. Two types of GM, crushed gravelly soil from a quarry and crushed concrete aggregate (i.e., a recycled material), were used. The specimens were produced by moist-compaction and then cured at constant water content under unstressed conditions for seven days. They were re-cured basically for two days under different stress states during otherwise drained TC loading at a constant strain rate. Yielding characteristics upon the restart of drained monotonic loading (ML) at a constant strain rate toward ultimate failure at the same or increased or decreased confining pressure were evaluated. The stress-strain behaviour before the stress state reaches the current yield locus is very stiff and highly reversible. Unlike elasto-plastic materials exhibiting no ageing effects, the yield locus expands during sustained loading at a fixed effective stress state due to not only yielding associated with creep deformation, controlled basically by the viscous property, but also ageing, controlled basically by time-elapsing. The shape and location of current yield locus depends on the location of the current stress state relative to the current ultimate failure envelope. The observed yield characteristics were analyzed based on a newly introduced interactive double-yield concept while in the framework of the non-linear three-component elasto-viscoplastic model that takes into account ageing effects as well as an interaction between ageing and inviscid yielding (and its potential decay by irreversible straining). The trends of stress-strain-time behaviour observed with the two types of cement-mixed GMs are essentially the same.

In order to argue influences on characteristics of frequency response, frequency responses of several bender element test systems are experimentally identified by using eleven kinds of frequency-swept signals. Test results show that the frequency response of the system is substantially determined by the kinds of sample and identification of frequency response is affected by characteristics of input frequency-swept signal. Then reconstructed received waveform is calculated and compared to observed waveform. A normalized cross-correlation function is proposed to estimate quantitatively the degree of similarity between two waveforms and applied to the reconstructed and observed waveforms. This comparative analysis reveals that accurate identification of frequency response in a given frequency range leads to accurate waveform reconstruction. Also, test results show an additional advantage of this reconstruction technique in a noisy environment.

In the procedure, the effects of the irregular geometry of the sliding plane and generation of excess pore water pressure in the weak layer which forms partly the sliding plane are considered. In the computation following the proposed procedure, a negative yield seismic coefficient to induce a safety factor of unity can be obtained because of the effect of excess pore water pressure, while the residual displacement can become a finite value because the sliding plane becomes flatter in general after the slope undergoes a large displacement.

The copper concentration was measured in real time by means of two fibre-optic sensors with reflective-type located on either side of the undisturbed granite soil sample. The adsorption properties were also studied by the column and batch testing. It was found that the copper adsorption of both slightly and severely decomposed granite soil followed a Freundlich model, and the measured values of both samples corresponded well with the calculated values. In this paper, the experimentally obtained copper dispersion characteristics are compared with the contour and velocity vectors by FEM analysis using the advection-dispersion equation. It is shown that the copper concentration and velocity distributions in the severely decomposed granite soil are dependent on the usual parameters, such as the modified coefficient of permeability, retardation factor, dispersion length and dispersivity, which control the flow into the macro (>0.1 μm) and meso pores (0.002-0.1 μm).

Kiyota T., Kosek J., Sato T.	Comparison of liquefaction-induced ground deformation between results from undrained cyclic torsional shear tests and observations from previous model tests and case studies	2010	Soils and Foundations	50	3		421	429		3	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-80051760380&partnerID=40&md5=f16d5562870d3b765b7cda803a37d7c4	Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Japan; Integrated Geotechnology Institute Limited, Japan	Kiyota, T., Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Japan; Kosek, J.; Sato, T., Integrated Geotechnology Institute Limited, Japan	In order to investigate liquefaction-induced ground displacement, we conducted a series of undrained cyclic torsional shear tests on saturated Toyoura sand using a modified torsional apparatus capable of applying and measuring double amplitude shear strain up to about 100%. The limiting value of double amplitude shear strain, at which strain localization appears during undrained cyclic loading tests, was evaluated from the test results with reference to the change in the deviator stress during liquefaction. The limiting strain values, which increase with a decrease in the relative density of the specimen, were found to be consistent with the maximum amounts of liquefaction-induced ground displacement observed in the previous shaking table model tests and most of the relevant case studies. This feature is reasonable considering the reduction in the mobilized cyclic shear stress in liquefied soil due to the degradation of the shear resistance. As long as the liquefied soil layer remains in uniform deformation, these limiting strain values may be used in estimating the maximum amount of liquefaction-induced ground displacement.

The recommended procedure is described in detail, with some revisions and suggestions to the previous study by Tsukamoto et al. (2004b). The use of Swedish weight sounding tests is highlighted for estimating the extent of post-liquefaction settlement. Three case histories involving the post-liquefaction settlement of saturated soil deposits observed during the recent earthquakes are introduced. The use of maximum and minimum settlement potentials, S max and S min, is recommended to cover some uncertainty in making evaluations.

This paper proposes new testing methods for evaluating the effects of freeze-thaw action on the deformation-strength characteristics and the water retention-permeability characteristics of granular materials under unsaturated conditions. A triaxial apparatus and a permeability apparatus for unsaturated soils, with cooling systems to control the temperature of soil specimens and use the pressure membrane method instead of the pressure plate method, were newly developed in order to examine the hydro-mechanical behavior of unsaturated soils subjected to the freeze-thaw sequence, as experienced by in-situ soils in cold regions. Results indicate that the proposed testing methods with these newly developed test apparatuses are highly useful in the evaluation of the effect of freeze-thaw action on the hydro-mechanical behavior of unsaturated granular materials and in the reduction of total testing time.

Using this laboratory apparatus, pressure-controlled compaction grouting tests were carried out in specimens of completely decomposed granite (CDG) in Hong Kong. Precisely controlled injection water into a specially designed latex balloon in the specimen was to simulate a compaction grouting process. In these tests, the effective confining pressure, lateral earth pressure coefficient (K), excess pore water pressure, back pressure, void ratio change, and vertical deformation of the specimen were measured. The main focus was to investigate the development of injection pressure, void ratio, and excess pore water pressure due to compaction grouting and subsequent consolidation of soils. In addition, both the compaction efficiency and the average strength enhancement ratio are defined to evaluate the effect of compaction grouting.

The walls were constructed to a height of 6 m and flooded from the front of the structures to about mid-height and then drained in two to four stages. The walls were constructed with three different sand soils varying with respect to permeability, fines content and shear strength. Earth pressures and anchor loads were monitored during the flooding and draining stages and in-situ anchor pullout tests were performed. The analysis of results showed that the wall facings were very permeable and thus prevented unbalanced hydrostatic or seepage forces from developing during drawdown that could increase anchor loads beyond drained condition values. The accuracy of the current PWRC (2002) analytical model to estimate anchor capacity of MAW systems was demonstrated to vary widely depending on soil type and whether the soil was flooded or drained. However, on the load side, the method proposed by Miyata et al. (2009) to predict anchor loads was judged to be more accurate than the current BS8006 (2005) and PWRC (2002) methods based on the mean and spread of bias statistics where bias is defined as the ratio of measured to predicted anchor load.

The first order reliability method (FORM) targets the minimum reliability index related to the critical slip surface, and thus cannot be used to predict the system reliability of slopes, except when all possible slip surfaces are perfectly correlated. It is shown in this paper that the random finite element method (RFEM), which uses elastoplastic finite elements combined with random field theory in a Monte-Carlo framework can accurately predict the system probability of failure ( pf) of slopes.

Bruno 106, 98123 Messina, Italy	An empirical approach to analyze the torsional behavior of pile groups in which single-pile response is modeled by means of load-transfer curves, including an empirical factor to model the interaction between lateral and torsional response, is studied. The centrifuge tests were carried out on piles arranged in 1×2, 2×2, and 3×3 configurations, with a centre-to-centre spacing of three pile diameters and connected by a rigid cap with a clearance of 1.2 m from the groundline in the prototype. A good agreement between test data and numerical predictions is observed for the 1×2 and 2×2 groups, while the numerical analyses tend to overpredict the pile resistance at high load levels for the 3×3 groups. When a pile group is subjected to torsion, the sustained torque by each pile in the group is shared by the pile torsional component plus the lateral contribution from the pile shear force.		2-group; Centrifuge tests; Empirical approach; High load; Load transfer; Loaded piles; Numerical predictions; Pile groups; Rigid cap; Shear force; Test data; Torsional behaviors; Torsional components; Torsional response; Centrifugation; Nonlinear analysis; Numerical analysis; Piles						Basile, F., Analysis and design of pile groups (2003) Numerical Analysis and Modelling in Geomechanics, pp. 278-315. , (ed. by J.

The constitutive models were developed based on the overstress theory with different scaling functions and on the elastoplastic model S-CLAY1S which accounts for induced anisotropy and gradual degradation of apparent soil bonds. Laboratory tests were simulated on natural clays under one-dimensional and triaxial conditions to evaluate the scaling function influence in the modelling of the strain-rate effect on soil strength and creep effect. The influence of scaling functions on modelling the time-dependent behaviour under pressuremeter condition was also numerically examined. This test is treated as an example of a boundary value problem, which also allows us to see if this in situ testing is capable of deriving the parameters controlling the time-dependent behaviour.

The paper describes observed behaviour of a model tunnel embedded in dry sand subjected to cyclic ground shear deformation in a centrifuge, as well as the behaviour of the model ground during shear deformation. Detailed data on earth pressures acting on the tunnel lining and the sectional forces of the lining are presented during ground shear deformation. The data suggest that the earth pressure at tunnel crown before ground shear deformation is smaller than the full overburden pressure probably due to the formation of arch action and the arch action may deteriorate with the cyclic ground shear deformation, resulting in an increase in the earth pressure at crown and changing the distribution of the sectional forces, which are largely influenced by conditions between tunnel lining and invert.

Three different types of bentonite (i.e., MX80, Calcigel I, and Calcigel II) and a natural expansive clay (i.e., London Clay) were used. Total suction was measured using chilled-mirror hygrometer technique. The measurements were performed on specimens aged 1 hour, 6 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 2 months. The results show that the true equilibrium state for two types of bentonite (i.e., MX80 and Calcigel I) used is time dependent. Total suction increases with time and this behaviour is controlled by the characteristics of the bentonites. Total suction of the other specimens (i.e., Calcigel II and London Clay) is not affected by curing time. The changes in total suction with time as the specimen's age are attributed to non homogeneity of the water content distribution in the micro- and macropores of the bentonites and inaccuracy of the device used.

The behaviour prediction was carried out by employing soil-water coupled finite deformation analysis, which also included simulation of the embankment construction process. The information used in the analysis was limited to such things as the results of soil tests on soil materials (peat and calcareous soil) sampled from the ground, including their sensitivity ratios, and the embankment's construction history. The SYS Cam-clay model was used in the constitutive equations of the soils to determine the material constants of the soils and the initial conditions of the ground, and the computations were performed under plane strain conditions. As a result, the computed profiles of W-type ground settlement and of slip surfaces running through the embankment were found to be in good overall agreement with the actual profiles measured at the site. Furthermore, we found that this slippage is attributable to the undrained shear response of the soil elements in the calcareous soil layer, where slippage begins to occur during embankment loading. In other words, the slippage is caused by the rapid softening behaviour caused by the degradation of structure after the effective stress ratio reaches the vicinity of the critical state line.

Measurements of seepage flows, pore water pressures and displacements in different stages of the dams' lifetime were collected and suitably interpreted to detect the effectiveness of measured physical quantities in revealing watertightness problems. The paper focuses on the role of pore water pressure measurements to such a scope and enhances how the effectiveness of such measurements may be strongly affected by the particular stage reached by the consolidation process within the dam. The analysis of the two case-studies proved that pore water pressure measurements may result effective in revealing hydraulic problems only when significant re-equilibrium processes have taken place in the dam zones where the measurement points are located. Measurements result, instead, ineffective during a nearly undrained stage. The paper also discusses the effectiveness of seepage flow measurements to detect possible hydraulic problems.

Laboratory model tests show that when the water table rises to the footing level, there can be an additional 400 to 500% of the settlements compared to when the soil is dry. To understand the mechanics of the additional settlements of footings resting on the granular soil masses caused by water table rise, an investigation into the change in the Young's modulus of soil was therefore made using oedometer tests. A relation between the saturated and the dry Young's moduli of the granular soils is presented for use in the elastic analysis of footing settlements. The findings of the investigation were then used to predict the additional settlements of a model footing when subjected to a water table rise, using elastic analysis. The theoretical predictions of the additional settlements are lower than the actual additional settlements observed in the settlement tests conducted in the laboratory using model tests. The model tests show that the additional settlements are larger in loose sands than in dense sands.

A series of 1-g shaking table model tests were carried out to study the behavior of pile groups embedded in sloping ground subjected to lateral flow of liquefied soil. Two different configurations of pile groups: large (6×6 and 11×11) and small (3×3), were considered. The models were subjected to the liquefaction-induced large ground deformation to investigate the effect of several parameters on the response of pile groups and mechanism of lateral flow. These parameters comprise amplitude, frequency, and direction of input motion; density and slope of ground; and the thickness of non-liquefiable layer at the surface. The outcome of this parametric study reveals the importance of above mentioned factors which should be taken into account for analysis and design purposes. In addition, the results from the experiments clearly illustrate that in sloping ground configuration, both front (in upstream) and rear (in downstream) row piles receive greater lateral forces than middle row piles. This finding is attributed to the distribution of soil motion (displacement and velocity) of the liquefied soil in the model. As a result, installation of additional pile rows in front and behind an existing pile foundation can be considered as an effective retrofitting technique. Finally, soil-pile interaction was evaluated by running experiments with different pile spacings, and reliability of the JRA 2002 design manual in estimation of liquefaction-induced lateral force on piles is evaluated.

Three methods of shear strain evaluation techniques, which use soil motions recorded by embedded sensors within the soil specimen and external sensors on frame, were utilized to evaluate the shear strain-time histories in one-dimensional shaking cases. Coupled shear strainpore pressure responses throughout the liquefaction process are presented based on evaluated shear strains and measured pore pressures at corresponding depths. More insights of the interactions between the induced shear strain and generated excess pore pressure are also given, including the temporal variations of induced shear strain prior and after the initial liquefaction, development of liquefied zone, and duration of liquefaction state. These spatial and temporal variations of coupled responses reveal that the induced shear strain amplitude is not only an important property in triggering soil liquefaction but also a better index in defining the time of initial liquefaction. Identifications of these coupled features will be beneficial for verifying and interpreting testing data in physical modelling for liquefaction studies.

The dam models consisted of comparatively wellcompacted core zone and loosely compacted rock zone. A typical result among the model tests was also simulated by using a consolidation analysis method coupled with an elastoplastic model for unsaturated geo-materials. The main behaviour seen from the centrifuge tests was that large amounts of settlements due to wetting within the upstream rock zone were monitored; the crest of the dam at first moved toward upstream and then returned toward downstream in the first reservoir filling; and cracks along the dam axis were observed on the upper parts of the upstream and downstream slopes. A typical result of the dam model tests during reservoir filling was simulated. The simulation results showed that the settlements calculated agreed mostly with those measured; the settlements due to wetting could also be estimated within the upstream rock zone; the horizontal displacements toward upstream increased with the cycles of up-and-down water levels and they concentrated to a shallow region near the upstream surface; tension stresses were calculated at the places where the cracks were monitored in the model tests; and just after construction, arching actions in both the vertical and horizontal effective stress distributions could be seen on both the upstream and downstream boundaries between the core and rock zones but the arching action on the upstream boundary disappeared with water levels going up. The simulation method presented here provided an effective approach to analyze the behaviour of the rockfill dam during reservoir filling periods.

It is anticipated that the frequency of landslides will increase as a result of the impoundment of the reservoir of the Three Gorges Hydropower Station, and this has prompted geotechnical researchers to pay special attention to the problem. This paper introduces a landslide model test system, which allows studying of landslides induced by the combined effect of reservoir impoundment and rainfall. The system consists of a large flume with hydraulic lifting facilities, a set of computer-controlled surface sprinklers and pipes to simulate rainfall and reservoir impoundment, as well as a comprehensive instrumentation and data acquisition system. A model test carried out to study the Shiliushubao landslide, which occurred in the Three Georges Reservoir area, is presented to demonstrate the potential application of the test system. It is shown that the horizontal and the vertical displacements are abruptly increasing, when the reservoir impoundment and rainfall are combined, which cause the failure of the model slope.

Pullout resistance of bearing reinforcement embedded in sand	2010	Soils and Foundations	50	2		215	226		8	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-79960163074&partnerID=40&md5=527a3730d51a7f74d219ee0a94562cee	School of Civil Engineering, Construction Technology Research Unit, Suranaree University of Technology, Thailand; Construction Technology Research Unit, Suranaree University of Technology, Thailand	Horpibulsuk, S., School of Civil Engineering, Construction Technology Research Unit, Suranaree University of Technology, Thailand; Niramitkornburee, A., Construction Technology Research Unit, Suranaree University of Technology, Thailand	Mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) structure has been widely accepted as a retaining structure. Its construction cost is mainly controlled by backfill materials, which are generally coarse-grained soils, and reinforcement type (steel volume). The present paper introduces a new cost-effective reinforcement, designated as Bearing Reinforcement. It is composed of a longitudinal member and transverse (bearing) members. The longitudinal member is made of a deformed bar, which exhibits a high pullout friction resistance. The transverse members are a set of equal angles, which provide high pullout bearing resistance. The maximum pullout bearing resistance of a single isolated transverse member, sbmax, can be determined by using the plasticity solution based on the modified punching shear failure mechanism. Influential factors governing the mobilization of pullout bearing resistance are spacing, S, leg length, B, and numbers, n of transverse members. The larger the S/B, the lower the transverse member interference. The S/B ratios of &lt;3.75 and &gt;25 are referred to as full and free interference, respectively. The relationship between normalized average pullout bearing stress, σbn/ nσn and pullout displacement, d, where σbn/n is average pullout bearing stress of the bearing reinforcement with n transverse members and σn is applied normal stress, is practically identical for the same level of transverse member interference. This relationship can be modelled by hyperbolic function. From this finding, a suggested procedure for estimating pullout characteristics (maximum pullout resistance and pullout force versus displacement relationship) of the bearing reinforcement for any level of transverse member interference (any S, B, and n) based on a one point test on the bearing reinforcement with a single isolated transverse member is proposed. Good agreement has been obtained between the predicted and the measured pullout characteristics. This suggested method is useful for the internal stability analysis of MSE wall in terms of engineering and economic viewpoints.

In the element test, through stress-strain relation is regarded as uniform within the specimen of soil, it is usually non-uniform in reality. Due to limitation of element test devices for soils in laboratory test, a perfect element test is impossible in reality due to some factors such as an initial imperfection of test specimen, friction between loading plates and specimen, gravitational force of specimen and etc. It is, therefore, necessary to answer the question whether the results of an element test commonly used in laboratory test are convincing in determining the mechanical behaviours of the soils. If the answer is yes, then how much is the influence of these factors on the tests which is usually regarded as an element behaviour. In the simulation, the element is considered as a boundary value problem. The influence of those factors such as amplitude and frequency of cyclic loading, confining stress is also considered in detail. In the simulation, all values of material parameters are kept the same, which makes the numerical simulation being meaningful.

To encourage the geotechnical engineers to apply unsaturated soil mechanics theories in routine practice, numerical methods, based on the SWCC and saturated soil properties, have been developed to predict unsaturated permeability function and unsaturated shear strength properties which are expensive and time consuming to measure in laboratories. Further, several methods have been proposed to predict the SWCC in order to avoid difficulties in measuring the SWCC in laboratories. It is time consuming and it may require special techniques or apparatus to measure the SWCC in laboratories. However, it is important to have laboratory measured data of SWCCs to enhance and verify the proposed numerical methods. Hence, employing a Tempe pressure cell apparatus, the present study aims to investigate the effects of dry density and grain-size distribution on the SWCCs of sandy soils. Drying and wetting SWCCs were obtained for four sandy soils with different dry densities. The test data were best-fitted using the Fredlund and Xing (1994) equation and found that the fitting parameter, a, increases linearly with increasing the air-entry value of the SWCC and the fitting parameter, m, decreases with increasing the residual suction of the SWCC. The results revealed that soils with a low density have lower air-entry value and residual suction than soils with a high dry density. Further, the maximum slope of drying SWCC and hysteresis of drying and wetting SWCCs decrease with increasing density of soil. The air-entry value, residual suction, and hysteresis (the difference between the drying and wetting SWCCs) tends to decrease when the effective D10 of the soil increases. A soil with uniform grain-size distribution (the steeper slope in grain-size distribution) has a less hysteresis and a greater slope of drying SWCC than those of a non-uniform soil.

Horng V., Tanaka H., Obara T.	Effects of sampling tube geometry on soft clayey sample quality evaluated by nondestructive methods	2010	Soils and Foundations	50	1		93	107		7	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-79953242885&partnerID=40&md5=a24af73cc773a6486ffbb16d06b560eb	Hokkaido University, Japan; Kajima Corporation, Japan	Horng, V., Hokkaido University, Japan; Tanaka, H., Hokkaido University, Japan; Obara, T., Kajima Corporation, Japan	Sample disturbance caused by difference in sampling tube geometry was evaluated by two nondestructive methods: the measurement of the residual effective stress ( p'r) by ceramic disc; and the use of the bender element to ascertain the shear wave velocity (Vs), and thus the maximum shear modulus (GBE). Samples were measured under atmosphere, i.e., not under confined stress conditions. The soil samples were obtained from two sources: reconstituted Kasaoka clay prepared in the laboratory, and at the test site at Takuhoku, Hokkaido, Japan. Samplers with different geometrical designs, referring to the Japanese standard stationary piston sampler, were used for the model ground and field sampling. The geometrical effects of the sampling tube, for example, the thickness of the tube wall, the edge angle, and the existence of a piston were carefully examined. The quality of the samples taken with different samplers was evaluated by p'r and G BE, values which were normalized by the in situ vertical effective stress (ω'vo) and Gf measured by the seismic cone test in the field. It was found from these studies that p'r/ ωvo and GBE/Gf vary considerably due to the geometry of the sampler, with the edge angle of sampling tubes being the most important feature in obtaining high quality samples. The wall thickness, and thus, the area ratio of the sampler is not critical to the sample quality if the edge angle is sharp enough. The existence of the piston does not significantly influence the sample quality in field samples. Furthermore, the correlation between GBE and p'r was also investigated, and it was found that the two parameters are strongly dependent.

Yamada S., Takamori T., Sato K.	Effects on reliquefaction resistance produced by changes in anisotropy during liquefaction	2010	Soils and Foundations	50	1		9	25		5	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-79953237701&partnerID=40&md5=05f10507a0fe6ab61bd5d654071ca9ab	Department of Civil Engineering, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan	Yamada, S., Department of Civil Engineering, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan; Takamori, T., Department of Civil Engineering, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan; Sato, K., Department of Civil Engineering, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan	A distinctive characteristic of the reliquefaction behavior of soils is that there are instances where the phenomenon of a sharp decrease in liquefaction resistance occurs in spite of increases in soil density caused by drainage of water after liquefaction. On the other hand, there have also been examples of increased liquefaction resistance occurring throughout a soil's liquefaction history that cannot be explained merely by density increases. These facts point to the existence of factors other than density that sway the liquefaction resistance of soils. The current paper demonstrates that, in fact, anisotropy is an important factor influencing liquefaction resistance. This is made clear through the results of systematic triaxial shear tests, which show that the higher the level of developed anisotropy, the lower the liquefaction resistance. In the process of verifying the above, we found that continuous and orderly changes in anisotropy are repeated with dizzying rapidity during liquefaction. Furthermore, we show herein that there is no intrinsic difference between the inherent anisotropy acquired by soil during its sedimentation period and the induced anisotropy produced by plastic deformation developed through its stress history, although anisotropy has often been divided into these two types and has been considered separately in the past.We also show that what has been referred to as inherent anisotropy is nothing more than the initial state of induced anisotropy.

The field studies included the characterization of the thickness, grain size distribution and void ratio of the fouled ballast layer, as well as a large number of plate load tests, both on the fouled ballast layer and on the subgrade. The resilient behaviour of the fouled ballast was evaluated in the lab by cyclic triaxial tests on large size reconstituted specimens with distinct fouling indexes (different grain size distribution) and distinct humidity states (dry or wet). The results obtained were used as support for the decision to maintain the fouled ballast layer under the new sub-ballast in a number of stretches of the renewed line.

Changes in air pressure during deformation are in some cases important in practice. For example, in order to explain the stability problems of embankments during earthquakes and seepage flow, and grounds containing gas associated with the dissociation of methane hydrates, it is necessary to consider the interaction between the soil and the pore fluids. In the present study, we carried out fully undrained tests as well as drained tests, namely, constant water and constant air shearing tests. We performed the fully undrained tests using an air-controlled valve to measure the pore air pressure. For the stress variables of the unsaturated soil, skeleton stress values were used to describe the experimental results. From triaxial compression tests on silty soil, we found that the initial suction, the confining pressure, and the strain rate of unsaturated soil strongly influence the stress-strain behavior of unsaturated silt.

In this paper, the effect of seepage flow on slope stability is investigated by means of a strength reduction method. It is demonstrated that the factor of safety (FOS) for a sandy soil slope is influenced by seepage flow more than other types of soil. If the pore pressure is generated by the use of a piezometric line, the FOS is smaller than that generated by seepage flow analysis. The difference is small for clayey soil slopes but is larger and more noticeable for sandy soil slopes. The analysis also shows that the installation of retaining walls to increase the length of the seepage path is effective to prevent slope failure induced by seepage flow. The effects of water flow on soil nailed slopes, locally loaded slopes and pile reinforced slopes are also investigated in this study. The present study also shows that the effect of densely populated soil nail on the seepage flow can be neglected for practical purposes.

We developed procedures using previously derived analytical equations for the relationship between air discharge rates from an extraction well and the air pressure head generated in the neighborhood of the extraction well in soil with a uniform degree of water saturation in order to obtain these parameters in soil with varying degrees of water saturation. We verified that these procedures could be used to obtain these parameters by using air permeability test data from five sites. In addition, we demonstrated that these procedures could also be applied to gravel soil with fast air flow.

To date, both Fick's model and the Dusty Gas (DG) model have been used to model the movement of gases in these systems. Dispersion is included in the dispersion-advection equation with Fick's Model for the movement of gases in gas-phase of soil, yet the movement of gases in multi-component gas-soil systems is considered to be expressed more accurately by the DG model than by Fick's model. However to date, no study has investigated the necessity of considering dispersion in the Dusty Gas (DG) model. We carried out column experiments for nitrogen-methane, nitrogen-carbon dioxide, and carbon dioxide-methane binary gas systems in sandy soil, and also did simulations on the same systems using both Fick's model and the DG model. A comparison of the results of the column experiments with our simulations confirmed that there was no need to consider the dispersion in the advection-diffusion equations with the DG model when the velocity of gas was 0.05-0.4 cm/s in Toyoura sand. Furthermore, our experiments and simulations with the DG model showed that, rather than dispersion, tortuosity should be taken into account in application of the DG model to the above condition.

In the load tests, the behaviours of the model foundations were investigated in detail, with particular focus on cyclic horizontal loading, and behaviour such as horizontal stiffness and the rotation of the foundation, the load proportions between the raft and the piles, and the bending moments and shear forces generated in the piles. A simplified three-dimensional deformation analysis method was used to simulate the experiments.	1-g test; Analysis method; Dry sand; Horizontal load test; Load proportion; Pile group; Pile head connection condition; Piled raft; Vertical load test	1-g test; Analysis method; Dry sand; Horizontal load test; Load proportion; Pile group; Pile head connection condition; Piled raft; Vertical load; Bending (deformation); Bending tests; Loading; Pile foundations; Piles; Testing; Loads (forces)						(2001) Recommendations for Design of Building Foundation, , Architectural Institute of Japan, (in Japanese); Broms, B.B., Lateral resistance of piles in cohesionless soils (1964) Journal of Soil Mechanics and Foundations Division, 90 (SM3), pp. 123-156. , ASCE; Fraser, R.A., Wardle, L.J., Numerical analysis of rectangular rafts on layered foundations (1976) Géotechnique, 26 (4), pp. 613-630; Harr, M.E., (1966) Foundations of Theoretical Soil Mechanics, , McGraw-Hill: New York; Horikoshi, K., Matsumoto, T., Hashizume, Y., Watanabe, T., Fukuyama, H., Performance of piled raft foundations subjected to static horizontal loads (2003) International Journal of Physical Modelling in Geotechnics, 3 (2), pp. 37-50; Horikoshi, K., Matsumoto, T., Hashizume, Y., Watanabe, T., Performance of piled raft foundations subjected to dynamic loading (2003) International Journal of Physical Modelling in Geotechnics, 3 (2), pp. 51-62; Kakurai, M., (2003) Study on Vertical Load Transfer of Piles, p. 304. , Dr. Thesis Tokyo Institute of Technology, (in Japanese); Kitiyodom, P., Matsumoto, T., A simplified analysis method for piled raft and pile group foundations with batter piles (2002) International Journal for Numerical and Analytical Methods in Geomechanics, 26 (13), pp. 1349-1369. , DOI 10.1002/nag.248; Kitiyodom, P., Matsumoto, T., A simplified analysis method for piled raft foundations in non-homogeneous soils (2003) International Journal for Numerical and Analytical Methods in Geomechanics, 27 (2), pp. 85-109. , DOI 10.1002/nag.264; Lee, C.Y., Discrete layer analysis of axially loaded piles and pile groups (1991) Computers and Geotechnics, 11, pp. 295-313; Matsumoto, T., Fukumura, K., Kitiyodom, P., Horikoshi, K., Oki, A., Experimental and analytical study on behaviour of model piled rafts in sand subjected to horizontal and moment loading (2004) International Journal of Physical Modelling in Geotechnics, 4 (3), pp. 1-19; Matsumoto, T., Fukumura, K., Horikoshi, K., Oki, A., Shaking table tests on model piled rafts in sand considering influence of superstructures (2004) International Journal of Physical Modelling in Geotechnics, 4 (3), pp. 21-38; Mindlin, R.D., Force at a point interior of a semi-infinite solid (1936) Physics, 7, pp. 195-202; Poulos, H.G., Davis, E.H., (1980) Pile Foundation Analysis and Design, , John Wiley and Sons, New York	Matsumoto, T.; Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Department of Civil Engineering, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan; email: matsumot@t.kanazawa-u.ac.jp								00380806		SOIFB	10.3208/sandf.50.63		English	Soils Found	Article	Scopus

Proposal of a simple method for assessing the susceptibility of naturally deposited clay grounds to large long-term settlement due to embankment loading	2010	Soils and Foundations	50	1		109	122		2	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-79953250931&partnerID=40&md5=f095a3f9c500c63cc6336cb25673d3b2	Central Nippon Expressway Company Limited, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan	Inagaki, M., Central Nippon Expressway Company Limited, Nagoya, Japan; Nakano, M., Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan; Noda, T., Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan; Tashiro, M., Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan; Asaoka, A., Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan	A simple method that utilizes the results of laboratory tests has been proposed for determining the susceptibility of soft clay grounds to large residual consolidation settlement due to embankment loading. It was found that there is a possibility of large long-term settlement if the sensitivity and compression index ratios of the clay material that constitutes the ground are equal to or more than 8.0 and 1.5, respectively. The compression index ratio is defined in this paper as the ratio (Cc/Ccr) of the steepest gradient of the compression curve of an undisturbed sample to that of the remolded sample. Through the SYS Cam-clay model, an elasto-plastic constitutive model that describes the actions of the soil skeleton structure, it was found that clays with large sensitivity and compression index ratios are characterized by initially highly structured soils and that decay/upgradation of the structure can easily occur due to plastic deformation. In addition, by following Schmertmann's graphic method for in-situ compression curve (1953), this paper proposes a method of deducing the in-situ initial conditions from the results of laboratory consolidation tests on undisturbed samples. These investigations revealed not only that large delayed settlement is facilitated in clays, which have higher degrees of structure and faster rates of structural decay, but also that the De method and other simple methods of predicting settlement may underestimate the amount of settlement.

The microstructure was investigated using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, pH measurement, specific surface area and soil chemical tests. The results indicate that a multitude of changes occurred in the properties and behavior of cement-treated clays that can be explained by the interaction between four underlying microstructural mechanisms. That is, it is suggested that the hydrated lime is formed by hydration, which causes the flocculation of the little clay particles, by the preferential attack of the calcium ions on kaolinite rather than on illite and monmorillinite in the pozzolanic reaction, by surface deposition and shallow infilling by cementitious products such as calcium silicate hydrate and calcium alumino silicate hydrate (CSH and CASH) on clay clusters, and finally, by the presence of water trapped within the clay clusters. The chemical properties of the cement-treated clays were found to depend on the plasticity of soil.

The experimental results indicate that the stress-strain curves show strain softening and hardening phenomena when the confining pressures are below and above 3.0 MPa, respectively. Since the generally hyperbolic model can not describe the strain hardening behavior very well and the Duncan-Chang model can not ideally describe the strain softening behavior of the frozen sandy clay, an improved Duncan-Chang model is proposed. This model can describe not only the strain softening behavior but also the strain hardening behavior of the frozen sandy clay, and the calculated results are rather coincident with the corresponding experimental data. In addition, it is also suitable for frozen silty clay with a high precision. Due to pressure melting, the shear strength of the frozen sandy clay changes nonlinearly with increasing confining pressures. In order to solve the problem that the linear Mohr-Coulomb criteria can not exactly reflect the shear strength of the frozen sandy clay, a nonlinearMohr criteria of the frozen sandy clay is presented. The calculated results illustrate that it has higher precision and can describe the shear strength of frozen sandy soils more accurately than the linear Mohr-Coulomb criteria does.

This report introduces a new practical method, which has been adopted in the annex of the design code, to evaluate soil parameters. The new method uses a correction factor corresponding to the coeficient of data variation. In this method, the characteristic value automatically refiects the variation of the derived values in association with the testing method and the reliability of the data interpretation. Compared to the lower limit of 95z confidence interval, which is widely adopted in general design codes such as Eurocode 7 and JGS4001, the characteristic value determined by this method is conservative when the number of data entries is larger than 10. This tendency is caused by the concept, in which characteristic values always refect the data variation, even though the number of data entries are significantly large. Generally, data variation in the depth profile can be reduced when the depth distribution is appropriately modeled. Also, data variation can be reduced by adopting a more reliable soil test. Accordingly, any efforts to reduce the variation are awarded in this new design code.

Ltd., Japan; Shiom, T., Takenaka Corporation Co. Ltd., Japan	Fill dams have long been designed by conventional specification based design methods which stipulate details concerning dam body materials, structural calculation methods, and construction methods. There are irrational aspects to applying the specification based design method to a case subjected to large earthquake such as the 1995 Hyogo-ken Nanbu Earthquake, a type that rarely occurs. Thus, since the Hyogo-ken Nanbu Earthquake, the concept of performance- based design that treats performance of a structure as the only requirement has been incorporated, and conventional specification-based design is now being replaced by performance-based design based on required performance as the design method for structures. When an earthquake strikes a fill dam, water in the dam must not overflow the dam body causing a severe disaster in the area downstream from the dam. It is, therefore, necessary that settlement at a dam crest during an earthquake does not exceed a critical value, requiring that it be designed by an analysis method capable of accurately predicting the quantity of settlement produced. This report describes a design study of a fill dam, which requires a high level of seismic performance because of its location conditions and functions. Performed by applying the concept of ISO23469 to an existing fill dam, the study focused on ? setting performance criteria, ? evaluating safety of a fill dam during an earthquake, and ? reinforcement method that satisfies the performance criteria and evaluation of its safety.

Ltd., Osaka, Japan; Kimura, M., Innovative Collaboration Center (ICC), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan	Recently the introduction of performance-based design into infrastructure including pile foundation is on process. For performance-based design, it is necessary to develop a practical prediction method for long-term displacements of pile foundation. In this paper, soil-water coupled analyses with FEM-FDM method are conducted to evaluate the longterm displacements of pile foundation installed in soft clayey ground. The analytical target is the actual pile foundation of road viaduct planned to be constructed in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. As constitutive model for ground, subloading tij model is adopted, which is a simple elasto-plastic model for normally and over consolidated soils. Further more, centrifuge model tests are conducted to verify the validity of the numerical analyses. As the conclusion of a series of analyses and centrifuge model tests, following aspects are clarified; 1) the long-term behaviour of pile foundation; 2) the influence of the thickness of bearing layer to the behaviour; 3) the mechanism of pile-soil-pile system, especially about how the load is allotted to each pile, how the migration of excess pore water pressure occurs, migrates and dissipates, and how the uneven settlement is caused.

The recent trend towards the performance-based design is pushed further to arrive at the optimum design by using the LCC principle. Since geotechnical engineering still has many uncertainties in the LCC calculation, consideration and decision were made to solve each of them. As a research product, an example calculation was made of an expressway embankment whose interruption upon a major earthquake would cause significant damage to the economy. The results show that the indirect loss due to the elongated travel time during the interruption is the most significant source of LCC. Accordingly, it was found that the choice of design specification is affected by, whether a conventional seismic design principle is employed or LCC-based principle is made use of.

Verification of road viability under seismic actions requires not only safety assessment of the failure mechanisms which may jeopardize single road components (embankment, viaduct, bridge, etc.) but also evaluation of performance. Viability of a road may be compromised by an unsatisfactory response of road embankments. The vehicle flux may be, in fact, inhibited or reduced if a road embankment suffers global instability mechanisms or significant permanent displacements mainly at the contact with structural elements (e.g., viaducts, bridges) that do not move significantly. In this case the embankment permanent displacements turn out into steps or separations. The paper accounts for the different stages followed to study the seismic performance of the road embankments located along a sample road branch of about 5 km. Preliminary activities consisted in characterizing the geological area of the sample road, in selecting the potentially vulnerable embankments and in carrying out in-situ investigations to properly characterize the physical and mechanical properties of the embankments and foundation soils. A seismological study of the sample area was performed in order to characterize the reference seismic actions needed for the numerical analyses. The seismic response of the embankments was evaluated by a pseudo-dynamic approach and an advanced dynamic model. In the latter, the equations describing dynamic equilibrium and compatibility were merged with an elastoplastic combined-hardening constitutive law that properly models soil response under cyclic loads. The embankment's seismic performance was predicted in terms of permanent settlements at the embankment top surface versus the peak acceleration of the reference input motions.

An undersea tunnel that loses its soundness and causes fooding or any other forms of accidents while still in service is likely to put human lives at risk and pose a threat to the safety of the social infrastructure, and the restoration of such structure may become impossible in some cases. However, because much of the behaviour of tunnels under operation is still yet to be defined, the maintenance of existing undersea tunnels is practically limited to the treatment of symptoms based on past experiences, as in the case for land tunnels. Focusing on the long-term measurements of Seikan Tunnel that have been recorded since 1988, this paper organizes and analyzes their results, examines the mechanism of long-term behaviour of tunnel lining, and proposes a new soundness evaluation methodology for the undersea tunnel lining (Tuchiya, 2007).

We focus on the settlements, horizontal displacements and rotations of a bridge pier founded on a rigid circular foundation on a relatively soft cohesive soil. A newly developed macroelement model is used for the description of the footing-soil system. Its objective is to reproduce the geometric (uplift of the footing) and material non-linearities (soil plasticity) that arise at the foundation level during a seismic excitation. The utility of macroelement modeling resides in the fact that it allows for the execution of a large number of non-linear dynamic analyses of the pier under the horizontal and vertical components of real acceleration time histories as well as under the combination of both. The results concentrate on two main points: the influence of the vertical component of the seismic input motion on the maximum and residual displacements of the foundation and on a discussion of possible correlations betweenthe induced displacements at the foundation level and certain parameters describing the severity of the seismic input motion.

In most cases of roadway subsidence, underground pipes exist underneath the subsidence. In order to understand significant factors leading to local subsidence at a ground surface, a series of model tests using sandy soil were performed with the concerned defect configuration of the underground pipe and hydraulic condition. An industrial X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner was used to investigate the behaviour of the model ground at each step of monotonic water inflow, monotonic soil drainage and the cyclic water in- flow-soil drainage. Then, the behaviour density change of the model ground was visualized as a density change intwo-dimensions and three-dimension. This paper concludes that the cyclic condition of water in flow-soil drainage caused fatal ground failure as the water inflow process created a water path disturbing the soil. Subsequently, the soil drained and the soil particles were interlocked due to the drainage. The movement of soil particles were restricted with the arching effect; and, the factors causing the cavity in the ground were not only the existing defect in the underground pipe but also the water flow towards the defective part after the loss of capillary force.

Due to various sources of uncertainty, settlement analysis models and the soil or rock properties required for settlement analysis may be in error; hence any settlement estimate is a random variable. To develop limit-state design codes for largediameter bored piles, analysis methods for estimating the settlement of large-diameter bored piles need to be carefully calibrated. This paper aims at calibrating four analysis methods for bored piles in soils (Vesic's elastic method, Mayne and Harris's analytical solution, O'Neill and Reese's load-transfer method, and a method based on load-transfer curves established in this paper based on Hong Kong data) and three methods for bored piles socketed in rocks (Vesic's method, Kulhawy and Carter's method, and a load-transfer method using the correlations established in this paper based on Hong Kong data). For rock-socketed piles, two methods for estimating the rock deformation modulus are further studied: One based on a correlation with rock quality designation and the other based on a correlation with rock mass rating. These analysis models have been calibrated at the working load level using 36 cases of static loading tests on large-diameter bored piles in Hong Kong with complete soil and rock information. The effects of construction on pile settlement have also been included.

The study refers to a real case, the Camastra Dam, a zoned earth dam with vertical clay core, placed in a highly seismic zone of Southern Italy. At first, the analysis objectives have been identified along with the physical quantities needed to achieve them for characterizing dam seismic performance. A theoretical approach, consistent with the identified analysis objectives, has been later selected. The adopted approach is based on continuum mechanics and accounts for coupling between soil skeleton and pore water phase. It is also able to describe the main features of soil response under cyclic loading conditions since it implements an advanced constitutive law for the soil skeleton. Big effort has been paid to the mechanical characterization of the dam materials. In addition to data coming from the interpretation of the laboratory tests performed at the time of dam construction, in situ tests (SASW, Down Hole, DMT) have been recently carried out on the embankment and foundation soils and interpreted consistently with the requirements of the selected theoretical model. Preliminarily, the static stages of the dam lifetime have been numerically simulated to reproduce the behaviour observed in terms of cross-arm settlements and pore water pressures, in order to obtain or verify some soil parameters and initialize the state variables for the simulation of the seismic stages. A seismological study of the dam site provided the expected seismic scenarios in terms of time histories of acceleration, needed as input for the dynamic analyses. The seismic response of the Camastra Dam was finally investigated and discussed in the light of performance-based criteria.

Due to various sources of uncertainty in understanding the geology and construction details, estimation of design loads, and design analysis models and their parameters, the estimated pile capacity values from several design methods for large-diameter bored piles vary widely and the corresponding reliability levels are not clearly known. This paper aims at evaluating the performance of six design methods for bored piles in soils and four design methods for bored piles socketed in rocks based on a database of 62 full-scale load tests on large-diameter bored piles in Hong Kong. These methods include a descriptive method, the β-method, and several empirical correlations with blow count from the standard penetration test or unconfined compressive strength of rock. The capability of these design methods to estimate individual resistance components and the total capacity is calibrated separately. Construction effects, particularly the use of permanent liners, pile-shaft grouting, and the time delay between the end of pile excavation and pile concreting, are explicitly considered. The performance of each design method is indicated by the first and second moments of the model bias factor, which can be used as a basis for developing partial factors for limit state design.

Since the tested bentonite is of sodium type, it absorbs water remarkably, and hence it is dificult and time-consuming to consolidate it for shear tests. This dificulty was overcome by inventing a new consolidation tank in which the drainage path is significantly shortened, and consequently the consolidation time is shortened. Cyclic torsion shear tests were performed on thus-prepared specimens to examine the variation of shear modulus and damping ratio with increasing shear strain amplitude. Moreover, cyclic shear stress was applied on an anisotropically consolidated specimen to demonstrate that permanent distortion of bentonite is small even during a very strong earthquake loading.

Applicability of t-bar and ball penetration tests to soft clayey grounds	2009	Soils and Foundations	49	5		729	738			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-78349278498&partnerID=40&md5=ed622438057a26a705c41f969a2fddde	Toa Corporation, Japan; Hokkaido University, Japan; Nikki Corporation, Japan	Nakamura, A., Toa Corporation, Japan; Tanaka, H., Hokkaido University, Japan; Fukasawa, T., Toa Corporation, Japan, Nikki Corporation, Japan	T-bar and Ball penetration tests (TPT and BPT, respectively) were carried out at three sites consisting of soft clays. These penetration tests have several advantages over the conventional cone penetration test (CPT): much larger project area and no effects of overburden pressure for obtaining soil parameters such as undrained shear strength. Therefore, TPT and BPT are considered to be suitable in-situ tests for very soft ground. In this paper validity of the assumed mechanism of these cones are examined, using ball cones with different diameters of the ball. In addition, the cone factors for CPT, TPT and BPT are compared based on undrained shear strengths (su) measured from field vane and direct shear tests. Cyclic BPT was carried out to measure the sensitivity of soil layers. It is revealed that reduction in the tip resistance with the increase in the number of cyclic penetration can be correlated with the sensitivity measured by the field vane tests. Finally, the possibility of estimating the in-situ effective overburden pressure (σ''vo) is discussed for an artificial island filled by dredged clayey soil, where consolidation due to self weight of the filling is still continuing.

Devices rated in the 0.5 to 7 MPa range are considered and it is shown that they can develop marked cell-action effects, including strong non-linearity and hysteresis. A new approach to cell calibration and characteristic modelling is presented. It is shown that measurement errors may only be kept within tolerable limits through complex calibrations involving cells with suitable boundary conditions combined with a multi-stage loading history dependent, data reduction procedure.

Many studies have been carried out in the past to determine the matric suction through direct and indirect methods. Direct measurement of matric suction has been proven possible with high-suction tensiometer; however high-suction tensiometers are still susceptible to cavitation. The axis translation technique developed by Hilf (1956) has been employed in many laboratory tests for unsaturated soils to avoid problem of cavitation in the water pressure measurement system. However in laboratory testing of unsaturated soils, air and water pressures are usually independently controlled and there is no need for a feedback control. The matric suction of soil can be measured using a modified pressure plate apparatus by actively changing the air pressure to maintain the water pressure to be close to zero thus imposing negligible water content change in the soil. A major setback of the existing practice is the need to manually adjust the air pressure of the modified pressure plate in response to the changes in the water pressure. This paper presents an active control system for the modified pressure plate apparatus for matric suction measurement. The experimental results obtained from modified pressure plate apparatus with active control system show good performance as compared to the high suction tensiometer.

(2005) predicts permanent deformations in non-cohesive soils due to many cycles (N&gt; 103) with relatively small amplitudes (εampl&lt; 10 3, so-called high- or polycy- clic loading). This paper demonstrates the applicability of the HCA model to different sands. For this purpose, approximately 200 triaxial tests with 105 cycles each have been performed on eight different quartz sands with mean grain sizes in the range of 0.15 mm≤f 50≤4.4 mm and coefficients of uniformity in the range of 1.3 ≤ tU c≤4.5. For each sand, test series with a variation of stress amplitude, initial relative density, average mean pressure pav and average stress ratio νav= qav/pav have been conducted. The influence of the grain size distribution curve on the rate of strain accumulation is discussed. A comparison of the measured data with predictions made by the HCA model (with different material constants) is given. Correlations of the material constants with index or granulometric properties are discussed. The correlations may be useful for a simplified procedure to determine a set of material constants.

Detailed investigation was conducted after this event in order to identify the mechanism of this failure, which consisted of the field studies as well as laboratory tests and numerical analyses. It was consequently shown that the combined effects of heavy rainfall and the local geological and topographic conditions as well as the reduction of drainage capability due to the breakage of perforated pipe in the un- derdrainage system were the causes of the failure.

For this purpose, the surveys were conducted in Lake Baikal, Russia from 2005 to 2007, where shallow gas hydrates existed. For the lake-bottom sediments, physical and mechanical properties were tested (on-board and laboratory tests). The tested samples were retrieved from the mud volcano ground which contains the shallow gas hydrates, and reference ground at the same area. From these results, it was found that the gas hydrates distribute in large amounts in the lake-bottom sediments of Lake Baikal, and that form of the gas hydrates are varied. In addition, the reference samples in Lake Baikal have no marked differences in the soil properties of the sediments obtained from other sea-bottom grounds. On the other hands, the strengths of the mud volcano samples were lower than those of the reference samples. It would seem that these results are due to the effect of the disturbance of sedimentary layers by upwelling of gas and water from underground and the pressure release during the sampling.

CO-Seismic and post-seismic behavior of an alternately layered sand-clay ground and embankment system accompanied by soil disturbance	2009	Soils and Foundations	49	5		739	756		4	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-77956162099&partnerID=40&md5=1b0ed414b558d9aabe7c337cc4482734	Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya University, Japan; Fudo Tetra Corporation, Tokyo, Japan	Noda, T., Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya University, Japan; Nakai, K.; Asaoka, A., Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya University, Japan; Takeuchi, H., Fudo Tetra Corporation, Tokyo, Japan	In the evaluation of the damage caused by earthquakes, particular attention has been paid until now to the unstable behaviour (the phenomenon of liquefaction) of sandy grounds during tremors. However, studies of post-seismic damage and damage to clayey grounds have also been reported. In this paper, the behaviour of an actual alternately layered sand-clay ground and embankment-coupled system before, during, and after an earthquake is investigated. The investigations were carried out by soil-water coupled finite element analysis {GEOASIA), which is capable of handling inertial forces and utilizes the SYS Cam-clay model as the elasto-plastic constitutive model of the soil skeleton. By accounting for the effects of the soil skeleton structure (structure, overconsolidation, and anisotropy) at work, the above constitutive equation is capable of expressing the reduction of shear modulus, etc. caused by disturbance in loose sands and naturally deposited clays. In the analysis, (1) the effect of the rigidity of the embankment and (2) the effect of the penetration depth of the sheet pile in a strengthened ground with retaining walls and sheet piles joined by tie rods were examined. The main results are as follows: (1) If the embankment is soft, liquefaction of the upper sandy soil layer during the earthquake causes the embankment itself to collapse. In contrast, if the embankment is relatively hard, the shape of the embankment remains stable. However, a decrease in shear rigidity occurs in the lower clayey soil layer due to degradation (disturbance) of the soil structure, resulting in increased settlement both during and after the earthquake. (2) In the case of grounds strengthened by the sheet pile method, if the tips of the sheet piles are located in a soft soil layer with a high degree of structure, large disturbance may occur at such locations during an earthquake and cause increased settlement during and after the tremors.

Spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW) technique is an in-situ nondestructive method used for near surface soil site profiling. In the present study experimental uncertainties related to this method are assessed in connection with test configuration specification and data quality. Field experimentations have been conducted for this purpose with various spatial configurations of source to near receiver distance and inter-receiver distance under various impact source magitudes and heights of fall. Based on the experimental findings, a method has been proposed to identify the frequency range of interest based on a threshold minimum cross power spectrum value. Further, it is proposed to consider subset stacking combination with good data quality which can be estimated based on weighted evaluation of the coherence of each frequency and importance of different frequency ranges. A procedure of obtaining the site specific dispersion curve is illustrated with due consideration to the issues associated with data quality and power spectra.

Wet compaction and lime stabilization to mitigate volume change potential of swelling clayey soils	2009	Soils and Foundations	49	5		813	821			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-78349278896&partnerID=40&md5=cd5bfe47d7fb9f3761566bcbc4d28d23	Department of Civil Engineering, Makerere Unviersity, Kampala, Uganda; University of Tokyo, Japan; Geotechnical Engineering, University of Tokyo, Japan	Kasangaki, G.J., Department of Civil Engineering, Makerere Unviersity, Kampala, Uganda, University of Tokyo, Japan; Towhata, I., Geotechnical Engineering, University of Tokyo, Japan	In this study, the possibility of wet compaction method to reduce swelling potential of high plasticity (active) clayey soils has been investigated and compared with lime stabilization method. Swell (and shrink) potential tests were performed using an oedometer apparatus on sand-bentonite mixtures which were compacted immediately after mixing with water. Tests were then repeated on different samples of the same composition after allowing 3-day free swelling prior to compaction. This method of sample preparation is herein referred to as wet compaction. Additional tests conducted on lime stabilized samples with and without wet compaction enabled comparison of the wet compaction and lime stabilization methods. Test results showed that wet compaction reduces the swelling potential of sand-bentonite mixtures and can thus work as a mitigation technique to reduce swelling potential of high plasticity (active) soils. However, as expected, lime treatment was found to be superior, especially if the dose corresponded to or was higher than lime fixation point. In addition, the volumetric change of both untreated and treated samples after drying at 40°C in an oven (during drying, shrinkage deformations were measured) as well as the effect of cyclic wetting and drying on the unconfmed compression strength (UCS) of lime-stabilized samples were investigated.

This paper presents a simple procedure for evaluating the coefficients of volume change of unsaturated soils from measurements of the shear and dilatational wave velocities. The procedure is based on some analytical expressions that have been derived in the present study using the theory of linear elasticity for low-frequency excitations. The soil parameters required as input are the porosity and degree of saturation of the soil, Poisson's ratio of the soil skeleton, and three physical parameters that generally assume constant values. The results of some applications of the proposed method to a set of experimental data published in the literature are also shown.

Duttine A., Tatsuoka F.	Viscous properties of granular materials having different particle shapes in direct shear	2009	Soils and Foundations	49	5		777	796			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-78349269576&partnerID=40&md5=936d0c3acc8b58be9238312ce2adfe50	Department of Civil Engineering, Tokyo University of Science, Japan	Duttine, A., Department of Civil Engineering, Tokyo University of Science, Japan; Tatsuoka, F.	The viscous properties of air-dried relatively poorly-graded granular materials having different particle shapes were evaluated by performing a series of direct shear (DS) tests. The applied loading histories include repeated step changes in the shear displacement rate (s) or repeated sustained loading stages during otherwise monotonic loading (ML) at a constant s under constant vertical stress. Test results of an angular gravelly soil (i.e., Chiba gravel-a) obtained from the present study and those of a wide variety of poorly-graded granular materials (i.e., glass beads and natural sands including Toyoura, Hostun, Silica No. 6a, Ticino, Silver Leighton Buzzard, Ottawa, Albany and Monterey sands) previously obtained by the authors are analysed. The viscous properties of granular materials can be adequately described by three basic parameters: i.e., the rate-sensitivity coefficient, the residual rate-sensitivity coefficient (or their ratio, i.e., the viscosity-type parameter) and the decay parameter. These parameters, as well as the viscosity type (i.e., Isotach, Combined, TESRA and P&N), are strongly affected by particle shape as quantified in terms of the degree of particle angularity while being rather independent of particle size. The creep deformation that takes place by sustained loading increases with an increase in the shear stress level, and it also increases with changes in the viscosity type associated with an increase in mainly the particle angularity and partly the coefficient of uniformity. The various viscous property types and transitions among them can be described by a single general equation incorporating these parameters. A non-linear three component model incorporating this general equation can simulate very well all of the various viscous responses observed in the DS tests referred to in the paper.

A new elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model for sand is proposed, formulated based on a stress path-independent irreversible (or visco-plastic) strain energy-based hardening function. The function was derived based on results from drained plane strain compression (PSC) tests on saturated dense Toyoura sand along a wide variety of stress path. The model is coupled with an existing isotropically work-hardening and -softening, non-associated, elasto-plastic model for sand. The constitutive model takes into account the effects of loading rate due to viscous properties on the stress-strain behaviour as well as those of pressure level, inherent anisotropy and void ratio and work softening associated with strain localization into a shear band. It is shown that the proposed model can much better simulate the effects of stress history on the deformation characteristics of sand than many previous models. The FEM code incorporating the model is validated by simulating physical PSC tests and bearing capacity model tests of a strip footing on sand performed by previous studies.

This is considered to be the unique reason that those simplified slice methods, i.e., those satisfying part of equilibrium conditions, are still in use. The purpose of this study is to develop a solution procedure for those rigorous methods such as Morgenstern-Price's method. The procedure is so robust that it is able 1) to detect whether the solutions exist within a specified domain; 2) to find out all possible solutions; 3) and to trace all branches of equilibrium curves in the domain.

Through the experimental results, the flow on the fracture and the validity of the cubic law are discussed and estimated. As a result, it is understood that the cubic law cannot sufficiently explain the experimental results, although it can partially take into account the experimental results in the Re range of 0.02 to 0.2. Moreover, a simulation by a 2D model, including the inertia term, has been carried out. The 2D model has been found to show a good performance of the fracture flow in comparison with the representative fracture flow model, namely, LCL (local cubic law). The flow on the fracture shows the channeling flow and a higher Re value. Consequently, the flow on the fracture is thought to be caused by the influence of the inertia term.

The purpose was to evaluate the consistency of the bender element test results obtained by applying the exactly similar test material as well as the test method besides identifying the various existing hardware and software being used in this test. It was decided that the domestic TC29 group of Japanese Geotechnical Society (TC29-JGS) was expected to lead this international co-operation. By 2005, reports of the test results were obtained from 23 institutions from 11 countries. This report has been prepared by TC29-JGS taking a leading role from the beginning. A standard test method is proposed here in order to obtain more accurate data from the bender element test by examining various test methods adopted at different institutions worldwide and the effects of various factors on the test results.

To investigate liquefaction properties of sandy soils, undrained cyclic loading tests are usually performed. However, it would be difficult to simulate fully the actual soil behaviour through the laboratory tests because the tested sample can be disturbed even though it is taken by in-situ freezing technique. In this study, by using three kinds of in-situ frozen sandy soils which were taken from Holocene and Pleistocene deposits and their reconstituted samples, their volume change properties were measured during freeze and thaw processes at different confining pressures of 30 kPa and 98 kPa. In order to investigate the effects of the possible sample disturbance on the liquefaction resistance, small strain characteristics were measured as well, which would reflect the soil structure. Decreases in the small strain characteristics and the liquefaction resistance were observed in case of the Holocene specimens that were thawed at the confining pressure that was lower than the in-situ overburden stress. On the other hand, in case of the Pleistocene specimens, the effects of the confining pressure during the thaw process on the small strain characteristics and the liquefaction resistance were small. Such contrastive feature between the Holocene and the Pleistocene samples could be linked with the difference in the types of their natural aging effects.

A thermo-elasto-viscoplastic model for soft sedimentary rock	2009	Soils and Foundations	49	4		583	595		2	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-77956461403&partnerID=40&md5=31b5ec30a9402e9573d7ca23db14347b	Nagoya Institute of Technology, Japan; Department of Civil Engineering, Ditto, Japan	Zhang, S., Nagoya Institute of Technology, Japan; Zhang, F., Department of Civil Engineering, Ditto, Japan	In this paper, a new thermo-elasto-viscoplastic model is proposed, which can characterize thermodynamic behaviours of soft sedimentary rocks. Firstly, as in the Cam-clay model, plastic volumetric strain which consists of two parts, stress-induced part and thermodynamic part, is used as hardening parameter. Both parts of the plastic volumetric strain can be derived from an extended e-ln p relation in which the thermodynamic part is deduced based on a concept of 'equivalent stress'. Secondly, regarding soft sedimentary rocks as a heavily overconsolidated soil in the same way as the model proposed by Zhang et al. (2005), an extended subloading yield surface (Hashiguchi and Ueno, 1977; Hashiguchi, 1980; Hashiguchi and Chen, 1998) and an extended void ratio difference are proposed based on the concept of the equivalent stress. Furthermore, a time-dependent evolution equation for the extended void ratio difference is formularized, which considers both the influences of temperature and stresses. Finally, it is proved that the proposed model satisfies thermodynamic theorems in the framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

It presents Laplace transform analytic solutions for the time dependent hydromechanical responses of a decommissioned and backfilled deep tunnel drilled into a poro-viscoelastic host medium. Both the backfill, which is assumed as poroelastic, and the host medium are supposed saturated with water. The solutions developed and inverted numerically to obtain the responses in time domain are used to study the effects of lining support deterioration, the backfill stiffness and of the host medium viscosity. The convergence of the tunnel leads to the expulsion of water from the backfill into the host medium resulting in corresponding transient responses. Each of the key parameters studied can have the effect of either attenuating or accentuating the transient and long term hydromechanical responses by delaying or shortening the dissipation period depending on the direction of change taken by the parameter value. The solutions presented in this paper permit an assessment of the relative importance of these parameters. Comparisons are also drawn between a tunnel and a spherical cavity of identical radius. Generally speaking, the implications of lining support, backfill stiffness and viscosity of ground medium are more significant in terms of the resulting hydromechanical responses, for the tunnel than for the spherical cavity.

By contrast, the dusty gas model can be applied to multi-component gas systems with Knudsen diffusion. Blanc's law is a simplified version of the dusty gas model, but it can be used only for gas systems in which the tracer gas is dilute. Although the dusty gas model is superior to other methods for simulating gas systems within soil, it is not generally used because of its complexity. Numerical techniques such as the Eulerian-Lagrangian method for solving the advection-dispersion equation can be used to simulate the migration of chemical substance in the water or gas phases of soil within the range of every Péclet number. We derived the compound diffusion coefficient and compound velocity from the dusty gas model and formulated the advectiondiffusion equation with these values by using the characteristic finite element scheme. Results of the model developed here were consistent with the results of column experiments conducted in this study, and the precision of the developed model was verified.

For sands that contain fines (particles passing #200 sieve), an adjustment based on fines content in the CRR-q t correlation is called for in currently available procedures. Earlier laboratory calibration tests in reconstituted silty sand specimens performed by the authors have indicated that partial drainage in CPT played an important role in the CRR-q t correlations. A series of laboratory tests on undisturbed samples and field piezocone penetration tests (CPTU) were carried out in an alluvial soil deposit at two test sites in Central and Southern Taiwan. The results indicated that unlike the uniformly mixed specimens reconstituted in laboratory, the tested natural alluvial silt/sand soils can be heterogeneous with closely spaced clean sand layers embedded in a matrix of silty material. This stratification can render the CPTU a drained test even at fines contents well in excess of 50%. The ignorance of free draining effects on CPTU due to stratification in alluvial soils may lead to overestimation of CRR. Because of these factors, calibration of the CRR-q t correlations by performing tests in local soil and field procedures to ascertain the drainage conditions in CPTU are important to the proper application of the CRR-q t correlations in the liquefaction potential assessment.

In the present study, simpler and effective methods are proposed for the estimation of the smallstrain stiffness of clean and silty sands; these are based on triaxial compression test results and the CPT cone resistance qc. In the method based on stress-strain curves obtained from triaxial compression tests, an extrapolation technique is adopted within the small-strain range of a transformed stress-strain curve to obtain estimates of the small-strain elastic modulus. Calculated small-strain elastic modulus values were compared with the values measured using bender element tests performed on clean sands and sands containing nonplastic fines. The results showed that the method proposed produces satisfactory estimates of the small-strain elastic modulus for practical purposes. In the CPT-based method, two G 0-qc correlations available in the literature were evaluated. For isotropic conditions, both correlations produced reasonably good estimates of G0 for clean sands but overestimated it for silty sands.

Ground motion records for the area indicate the effects of a deep subsurface structure. Microtremor array observations were performed at three sites and gravity surveys at 120 sites in the Kashiwazaki area. The gravity basement estimated from the gravity surveys exists at a depth of about 1000 m around Kariwa Village Hall, and becomes shallow in the southwestern direction around Kashiwazaki City Hall. The gravity basement is compared with the results estimated by the microtremor array observations and validated at two sites, namely, KST and KVH (Kariwa Village Hall). The peak period of the calculated response spectra at Kashiwazaki Village Hall corresponds to the peak period of the observed H/V spectra during the main shock.	2007 niigataken chuetsu-oki earthquake; Earthquake; Geophysical exploration; Gravity survey; Microtremor; Seismic response (igc: C2)	2007 niigataken chuetsu-oki earthquake; Geophysical exploration; Gravity survey; Ground motions; Main shock; Microtremor array; Microtremors; Peak period; Response spectra; Subsurface structures; Buildings; Earthquakes; Geophysical prospecting; Geophysics; Seismic response; Structural geology; Geological surveys						Aki, K., Space and time spectra of stationary stochastic waves, with special reference to microtremors (1957) Bull.

Excess pore pressures equal in magnitude to the initial effective vertical stress were observed to be generated in the bearing layer of dense sand at both shallow (15 m) and deep (26 m) depths. This induced a dramatic reduction in base capacity and consequently, large settlements of the piles by as much as ~ 5D 0. A spherical cavity expansion solution for base capacity was validated against measured values showing good agreement, provided that excess pore pressure and dynamic shear stiffness in the bearing layer are known. A simple closed-form relationship, applicable to end-bearing piles, between the degree of liquefaction and the initial pile static safety factor was then developed against plunging failure at the pile base which can be used in design.

Under the natural condition, these soils are usually unsaturated and the large pores are easily drained. The present paper looks at the combined effects of soil structure and partial saturation on the mechanical behaviour of aggregated soils. Conventional and suction-controlled oedometer testing are used to evaluate the soil response at different combinations of saturation and the initial soil structure. The soil structure effects are assessed by comparing the behaviour of aggregated to that of the corresponding reconstituted soil.

Guo P.	Energy approach towards stress-dilatancy formulation based on double slip-rotation rate concept	2009	Soils and Foundations	49	3		443	457			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-77953395885&partnerID=40&md5=4d80c5a58d663d623080666cc8c72103	Department of Civil Engineering, McMaster University, Canada	Guo, P., Department of Civil Engineering, McMaster University, Canada	This paper proposes a new approach for the analysis of shear-induced volume change of granular materials. Following a revisit to the micro-mechanical deformation mechanism and the findings from discrete element method simulations, it is concluded that the double slip-rotation rate mechanism is appropriate for the description of granular materials subjected to shear. The implementation of energy principle with the double slip-rotation rate mechanism provides a new method for the derivation of stress-dilatancy relation under general stress conditions without adopting Rowe's hypothesis of minimum energy ratio. This new approach can be easily extended to take into account the non-coaxility of granular material deformation. The dilatancy formulations proposed by Taylor, Rowe and Matsuoka-Nakai can all be recovered as special cases of the proposed approach. Comparisons with experimental data show that the new stress-dilatancy relation correctly captures the dilatancy behaviour of sand observed in both general 3D stress conditions and simple shear tests.	3D stress condition; Deformation; Dilatancy; Granular material	3D stress condition; 3D stress conditions; Discrete element method simulations; Energy approach; Energy principles; Experimental data; Micro-mechanical deformations; Minimum energy; New approaches; Non-coaxility; Rotation rate; Simple shear test; Stress condition; Stress-dilatancy; Stress-dilatancy relation; Volume change; Deformation; Mechanisms; Rotation; Three dimensional; Granular materials						Alonso-Marroquím, F., Vardoulakis, I., Micromechanics of shear bands in granular media (2005) Powders and Grains, pp. 701-704. , (eds. by Garcia-Rojo, R., and Herrmann, H.

In these cases the loading applied to the structure and foundation is significantly different to that applied to more typical larger offshore structures. The weight of the structure is much lower, and the horizontal load and moment applied to the foundation is much higher as a proportion of the vertical load. Design guidance for the combined loading response of shallow foundations under low vertical loads is sparse, and in particular much guidance is drawn from work where the vertical load applied to the foundation is close to the vertical bearing capacity. This paper addresses this lack of data by presenting results of combined loading experiments at low vertical loads on novel shallow foundations known as suction caissons. The experiments are carried out on dry sand at a low relative density to explore the drained response of the foundation. The experiments are successfully interpreted within the framework of work hardening plasticity, and information on the shape of the yield surface and the post-yield behaviour of the foundation is deduced. One of the key results is that the foundation can sustain moments and horizontal loads even when a tension is applied to the foundation.

Ghafghazi M., Shuttle D.	Confidence and accuracy in determination of the critical state friction angle	2009	Soils and Foundations	49	3		391	395		1	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-77953371995&partnerID=40&md5=dabd73ec9c2b98d59feb5732770753f1	Department of Civil Engineering, University of British Columbia, Canada	Ghafghazi, M., Department of Civil Engineering, University of British Columbia, Canada; Shuttle, D.	The critical state friction angle, 4φc, is a parameter of interest in many geotechnical analyses dealing with cohesionless soils. However, despite the triaxial test being widely used to estimate this parameter, the accuracy achievable from a limited number of triaxial tests is unknown. Accuracy is of particular interest in industry, where typically only a few soil tests are possible due to budget limitations. Statistical analysis of an extensive high quality triaxial testing program from the literature is used here to obtain guidance on the number, density range, and pressure range of triaxial tests required to reach a specified level of confidence in the critical state friction angle. The adequacy of the estimating methodology is then tested against a smaller and independent set of triaxial tests on the same sand, performed in a commercial testing laboratory. The results suggest about six drained triaxial tests are needed for routine engineering where a precision of ± 1.0° may suffice. However, for research or high precision work, more than twenty drained triaxial tests may be needed to determine φc to an accuracy of ± 0.5° at 90% confidence. In all cases, tested samples should be uniformly distributed across the range of the soil's relative density.

Polidori E.	Reappraisal of the activity of clays. Activity chart	2009	Soils and Foundations	49	3		431	441			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-77953400305&partnerID=40&md5=a5b9548a1aa7ce040616354500784df3	Department GEOTECA (Geological Sciences), University of Urbino 'Carlo Bo', Scientific Campus, Italy	Polidori, E., Department GEOTECA (Geological Sciences), University of Urbino 'Carlo Bo', Scientific Campus, Italy	The proposed activity chart, which aims to classify soils (<lt;425 μm) using the Atterberg limits, differs from the plasticity chart recently proposed by the author because the inorganic soils with platey clay minerals are classified (in addition to clay percentage) on the basis of their activity rather than on the degree of plasticity as a function of the liquid limit value, currently used by the standards. This is because soils that have the same liquid limit value may have very different characteristics because of both the amount and type of clay minerals contained in the soils. On the activity chart, the silt and the clay zones are subdivided (by two straight lines) in three new groups (low activity, medium activity and high activity) making it possible to classify inorganic soils with platey clay minerals (or their fraction) < 425 μm on the basis of the amount and type of clay minerals they contain. The activity chart adapted to predict residual shear behaviour of cohesive soils is also shown. Finally, the distinction between coarse-grained soils and fine-grained soils based on their percentage of clay (<2μmi), might be useful in characterizing and predicting soils' engineering behaviour.

A multilaminate model with destructuration considering anisotropic strength and anisotropic bonding	2009	Soils and Foundations	49	3		341	353		4	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-77951021455&partnerID=40&md5=a84c29415fe0f395f1289cc7ff8ace43	Computational Geotechnics Group, Institute for Soil Mechanics and Foundational Engineering, Graz University of Technology, Austria	Galavii, V.; Schweiger, H.F., Computational Geotechnics Group, Institute for Soil Mechanics and Foundational Engineering, Graz University of Technology, Austria	Many constitutive models have been developed to describe the behaviour of soils, but only more recently a limited number of them have paid attention to include effects of structure and consequently destructuration due to volumetric and/or deviatoric straining. Most of them consider isotropic behaviour for strength and structure of soil. In this paper a multilaminate type of constitutive model is presented in which anisotropic strength and anisotropic structure are taken into account. According to the mathematical formulation of the multilaminate framework, this kind of model is capable of taking into account induced anisotropy intrinsically. Inherent anisotropy can be introduced to the model by varying the model properties over sampling planes using a so-called micro structure tensor. Only mechanical destructuration, namely degradation of structure with deformation is considered in this paper. The proposed model is capable to consider anisotropy in bonding and preconsolidation pressure as well as inherent anisotropy in strength thus the hardening of the yield surface and strength parameters can be considered direction dependent. In this paper the drained and undrained behaviour of natural clays is simulated and the effect of different assumptions with respect to structure degradation and anisotropy is evaluated.

The anchor system comprises a hydraulically inflated rubber membrane or packer that may be bored into place and then inflated to provide pullout resistance. a series of scaled physical model tests were used to study the anchor performance and pullout capacity. The model tests were done in a calibration chamber using cohesionless sand and anchors of various length, diameter, embedment depth and inflation pressure. The anchor behaviour during pullout is interpreted using finite element analysis that accounts for non-linear soil behaviour, inflation and subsequent deformation of the inflatable membrane, and anchor-soil interaction. The scaled model tests and interpretations assist with identifying the dominant mechanisms affecting the pullout capacity of inflatable anchor systems.

The sheet pile quay wall was displaced laterally and the 2×3 pile group was forced by the flow of liquefied soil. This experiment was conducted in March 2006 at the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED), Hyogo Earthquake Engineering Research Center, Japan. Liquefaction-induced lateral spreading was achieved, and soil moved laterally about 1.1m behind the sheet pile quay wall. Lateral soil displacement was measured by the inclinometers, and results were in close agreement with the directly observed values. Soil lateral displacement and velocity of soil flow decreased as the distance from the quay wall in-creased toward the landside. Bending strain records were able to explain the damages to the piles, yielding at the top and buckling at the middle height. Lateral force of the liquefied soil exerted on the piles was obtained using earth pres-sure (EP) sensors and it is shown that rear row piles (close to the quay wall) received larger lateral forces than front row piles (far from the quay wall). This behaviour is explained by the distribution of displacement and velocity of the lique-fied soil throughout the shaking. In addition, the lateral soil force was back calculated from strain gauge data and the results are compared with the ones directly measured by the EP sensors. Then, the limitations and advantages of the back-calculation approach are elaborated in this study. Moreover, the time history of lateral soil force showed no cor-relation with either soil or pile displacements, while it demonstrated a fairly close correlation with the relative velocity until a specific time. This interesting finding would confirm the rate-dependent behaviour of the liquefied soil, though more data from large scale experiments, field testing and centrifuge model tests are needed in this regard.

Thèse particles evolve however, resulting in major changes of the overall behaviour of the aggregate. The development of settlements and the loss of strength in time are the main concerns in practice. The mechanisms leading to the breakage and eventually the destructuration of one single rock particle are investigated using the concepts of unsaturated soil mechanics since wetting and drying cycles, controlled by atmospheric changes, result in strong suction changes and are one of the main reasons for rock degradation. Numerical simulations of the behaviour of individual rock fragments when wetted until full saturation were performed. Several contributing factors, namely suction change rate, initial suction and confinement were investigated. The knowledge learned with the simulation of the degradation of single rock fragments was extended to simulate the behaviour of particle arrangements under some representative stress and suction paths. Some results of suction controlled tests used for the calibration of the models are presented. The calculated behaviour of single particles and aggregates under wetting is discussed and qualitatively compared with experimental observations of the individual rock fragments and the compacted material. The results obtained provide a new insight into the nature of degradation induced by wetting and drying. They provide also a mechanical explanation, at the level of rock fragments, for the overall behaviour of aggregates.

Measurement of the settlement of a cone submitted to incremental loading allows the détermination of a modulus correlated to those obtained using laboratory tests or derived from other in situ tests. This test can be carried out with standard static penetrometer equipment. After stopping the penetration of a static penetrometer cone at a selected depth, an incremental loading test is carried out until the failure of the ground under the cone is observed. Stress strain relationships can be drawn from cone resistance and sleeve friction. In this manner, a modulus and a friction angle can be obtained. Thus the classical CPT log is enriched offering new possibilities. In this paper the development of the first prototype and measuring devices and the proposed testing procedure are presented. a comparison of laboratory and field tests and geotechnical centrifuge models shows the validity of the testing procedure and the chosen interprétation method. The results of site investigations carried out on French national experimental sites are also discussed and compared with high quality borehole expansion test and field measurement of shear wave velocity. These investigations have been carried out using this new testing method in combination with a semi-heavy static Piezocone penetrometer in order to check the potential use for geotechnical design. An attempt is made in this paper to validate the interprétation method of the results, which can be used for routine geotechnical engineering.

Cyclic triaxial tests were carried out on saturated and unsaturated soil specimens. The results from tests on initially saturated specimens showed that the soil taken at 2.2 m depth has the lowest resistance to cyclic loading, in relation to its highest porosity and lowest clay fraction. This soil was then studied at unsaturated state with various initial water contents. Unsaturated soil specimens were first subjected to cyclic loadings to decrease their volume. These cyclic loadings were stopped when the volume decrease was approximately equal to the initial pore air volume, or when the pores filled by air were eliminated and the soil was considered to have become saturated. Afterwards, the back-pressure tubing was saturated with de-aired water and cycles were applied under undrained condition. Significant effect of initial water content was evidenced: the lower the initial water content, the higher the cyclic resistance. This can be explained by the densification of the soil during the initial cyclic loadings.

The clays were originally deposited elsewhere and subsequently moved and largely deformed during the Apennine orogenesis, so that their structure appears severely disturbed and fissured. The applicability of a continuum-based approach to describe the mechanical behaviour of a Representative Element Volume (REV, hereafter) of the natural, fissured clay is experimentally investigated by analysing the clay specimen deformation under plane strain compression by means of False Relief Stereophotogrammetry. The results of such analysis show that, despite the intense network of pre-existing fissures, the patterns of deformation - including the eventual development of shear bands within the REV of the natural clay - are similar to those observed for unfissured clays. Triaxial tests were carried out on both natural and reconstituted clay samples and the results were compared with those recognised in the literature to be typical of unfissured clays. Based on such comparisons, the study provides a few essential elements that are useful to define a general framework for the mechanical behaviour of intensely fissured clays.

Calibration of the model with results from several natural clays identifies a meaningful parameter range for the simulations. Then a systematic sensitivity analysis of the loading SBPM test curve is carried out with an infinite cylindrical cavity analogue, focusing on the variables and parameters that are specific to the bonded material. This analysis reveals that the effects of mechanical overconsolidation and bonding on the pressuremeter loading curves are very similar. Unloading and strain-holding phases of the test show a greater capability to separate mechanical overconsolidation from bonding. The limited effects of finite pressuremeter length and partial drainage on the simulated curves do not change those conclusions.

Comparison of predictive capabilities of selected elasto-plastic and hypoplastic models for structured clays	2009	Soils and Foundations	49	3		381	390		2	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-77953412142&partnerID=40&md5=a335680d1266ba34f7fbd7694efe8185	Charles University in Prague, Faculty Science Institute of Hydrogeology, Engineering Geology and Applied Geophysics, Czech Republic	Mašín, D., Charles University in Prague, Faculty Science Institute of Hydrogeology, Engineering Geology and Applied Geophysics, Czech Republic	This paper compares different approaches to constitutive modelling of natural structured clays by means of experimental data on natural Pisa and Bothkennar clays. The models evaluated are a hypoplastic model for structured clays, its simple elasto-plastic equivalent that requires parameters with similar physical meaning, and advanced elasto-plastic models based on kinematic hardening approach. Hypoplasticity predicts non-linear stress-strain response in the pre-failure region and different stiffness in different loading directions, it thus provides a clear qualitative advance with respect to the simple elasto-plastic model. It gives qualitatively similar predictions with the kinematic hardening models. The structure degradation and the large-strain response are predicted similarly by both the hypoplastic and elasto-plastic models, which show that the critical state soil mechanics theories can be treated successfully within the framework of the theory of hypoplasticity.

Determination of shear wave velocity by bender elements using variable-path length method	2009	Soils and Foundations	49	3		489	494			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-77953467501&partnerID=40&md5=6e4e9ea86b3ebd245b6d7db05f46003d	Department of Civil Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand; Hokkaido University, Japan; Department of Civil Engineering, College of Industrial Technology, Nihon University, Japan	Boonyatee, T., Department of Civil Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand; Chan, K.-H.; Mitachi, T., Hokkaido University, Japan, Department of Civil Engineering, College of Industrial Technology, Nihon University, Japan	For determining shear wave velocity by bender elements, several types of travel time methods have been proposed and are being used commonly. Although the methods have been established over a period of time, there are still many aspects that need to be improved. For example, the ambiguity of arrival time due to near-field effect and the distance measurement for soft sample during testing installation. This study seeks to propose an alternative method which could minimise such ambiguities. In this regard, a method called variable-path length method is proposed, which uses a continuous sinusoidal wave instead of a pulse wave, is applied to a series of tests on reconstituted Kasaoka clay in a modified triaxial apparatus. Based on the results, it is verified that the proposed method can measure shear wave velocity without the ambiguity of arrival time and independent of initial distance between transmitter and receiver. In addition, the proposed method has an advantage to determine phase velocity of shear wave at arbitrary frequency which is useful to study the frequency dependence of geomaterials.

Coupled measurements of water content and electrical conductivity in dielectrically lossy clay slurry using a coated TDR probe	2009	Soils and Foundations	49	2		175	180			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-77951486091&partnerID=40&md5=4b50f857d7b8a4372cdfd9f20830b1c9	Biotron Institute, Kyushu University, Japan; Kyushu University, Japan	Miyamoto, H., Biotron Institute, Kyushu University, Japan; Chikushi, J., Biotron Institute, Kyushu University, Japan; Kanayama, M., Kyushu University, Japan	Although time domain reflectometry (TDR) has been widely accepted as a non-destructive in-situ method with high reliability, the effective use of TDR for water content (w) and electrical conductivity (EC) measurements in clay slurry has not been established. We developed a Teflon-coated (TC) probe with a 0.05-mm thick fluorocarbon resin coating, and conducted a calibration experiment for kaolinite slurry to indicate its applicability to the measurements. The TC probe could estimate w from the observed effective dielectric constant (εeff) in the range of w ≥ 47% with a ± 6% error range. The εeff includes dielectric constant of two components: material under test (εm) and coating material (εtef). The relationship between εeff and w for this particular probe design cannot be directly applied to other coated probes because each probe has its own specific dielectric characteristic. We defined a function expressing the characteristic, that is εeff vs. εm, according to the testing in various fluid media. By applying the function, the observed data sets of εeff were transformed for a soil specific value (εm). Owing to the sufficient agreement of the £m values with those for the uncoated probe, we obtained the data sets of εm vs. w and its empirical expression for kaolinite slurry.

The instantaneous profile method (IPM) was used for 5r &gt; 50%. An original vapor equilibration method (also known as the vapor equilibrium technique, VET) was used for S r &lt;50%. Both materials compacted at the standard Proctor optimum water content and maximum density, have saturated hydraulic conductivities (ksat) &lt; 10-7 m/s. The VET couples the total soil suction (s) control from desiccators with saturated salt solutions with water mass measurements from a digital laboratory balance. The kw measurements of the two techniques are consistent and complementary. The effect of hysteresis on the kw functions at higher s values was also investigated. The experimental results suggest that the hysteretic effect on the kw-ST and kw-s relationships cannot be neglected, and that the measured kw are significantly dependent on the initial Sr. The VET tests on the specimens that were initially dried give the lowest values of kw and the tests on the specimens that were initially saturated give the highest values of kw. The relative hydraulic conductivity values are very small (krw &lt;2 × 10-5) in this saturation range (Sr &lt; 50%) for the tested materials.

A series of centrifuge shaking table test is conducted to investigate the seismic behavior of sheet pile quay wall stabilized with sea-side cement deep mixing (CDM). At 50 g centrifugal acceleration, the clay ground is consolidated and four to five stages of shaking are applied to the quay wall. The recorded input-output accelerations, deflection of the quay wall, earth pressures along depth and pore pressures were used to evaluate the behavior of the stabilized sheet pile quay wall. The results indicated that an improved area provides significant resistance against seismic loading. The ground improvement can reduce 30% to 60% bending moment during the seismic loading. The horizontal deflection of the quay wall decreases rapidly with increase in area of the CDM until it reaches a certain limit. Prediction by the numerical model agrees fairly well with the results of centrifuge model tests.

In this approach, the lateral and torsional responses of individual piles in a pile group are modeled by p-y and τ-θ curves; the interaction among lateral resistances of the individual piles is predicted through Mindlin's elastic solutions; the interactions between the torsional and lateral resistances of the individual piles are described through Randolph's solution; and the coupling effect of lateral resistance on torsional resistance of the individual piles is quantified using an empirical factor β. The proposed approach is capable of capturing the most significant aspects of pile-soil-pile interactions and coupling effect in pile groups subjected to torsion. The proposed approach is verified using results of centrifuge model tests. In general, the applied torque-twist angle response and the transfer of applied torque in pile groups can be reasonably well predicted and are sensitive to the pile group configuration.

The tests were performed on loose and dense specimens subjected to the following different loading histories: a) monotonic loading (ML) at constant shear displacement rate (ṡ) differing by a factor up to 100,000; b) ML at constant s including otherwise a number of step changes in ṡ by a factor of 100; and c) a number of sustained loading (SL) stages during otherwise ML at constant values of ṡ differing by a factor up to 1,000. Tests a) revealed that, with dense specimens, the peak shear strength is remarkably independent of ṡ while the residual shear strength noticeably decreases with an increase in ṡ. That is, the viscous property is the so-called TESRA type at the peak stress state, while it is the so-called Positive & Negative (P&N) type at the residual state. With loose specimens, both peak and residual shear strengths decrease with an increase in s, indicating that the viscous property is already the P&N type at the peak stress state and definitely so at the residual state. These results are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with those from tests b), by which the viscosity properties were quantified in terms of the rate-sensitivity coefficient. The results from tests c) showed that creep shear displacement, Δs, increases with a decrease in the tangent stiffness at the immediately preceding ML phase or with an increase in the shear stress level during the SL stage. The value of Δs for a given period steadily increases with an increase in ṡ during the immediately preceding ML phase. These trends of viscous behaviour are simulated all very well by a non-linear three-component model incorporating a general expression of viscous stress.

It was found that the values of ζie can be expressed as an exponential function of 'kh/ (1 - kv)' and 'α' with a measurable interdependency between 'α' and 'ζie'. The influence of V on the value of 'ζie' increases as the input value of 'kh/(1 - kv)' increases. Equations derived based on the analytical results are proposed to account for this effect. Based on the analyses of 11 near-fault seismographers obtained in the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, a ratio between the vertical and the horizontal seismic coefficients, λ, of between ± 0.25 is suggested for including the combined effect of vertical and horizontal seismic forces in evaluating the seismic bearing capacity of footings located in near-fault areas.

Okamura M., Noguchi K.	Liquefaction resistances of unsaturated non-plastic silt	2009	Soils and Foundations	49	2		221	229		5	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-77951489651&partnerID=40&md5=56aa2a0ca425cfa8435701fb0ca8805d	Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Ehime University, Japan; Okumura Corporation, Japan	Okamura, M., Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Ehime University, Japan; Noguchi, K., Okumura Corporation, Japan	It has been pointed out that there are two possible mechanisms that enhance liquefaction resistances of unsaturated sand. The first mechanism is where air in a partially saturated sand mass plays a role of absorbing generated excess pore pressures by reducing its volume. Okamura and Soga (2005) derived the influential factors of the liquefaction resistance for partially saturated sand from theoretical consideration and effects of the factors were examined through a series of triaxial tests on a clean sand. They found a unique relationship between liquefaction resistance ratios and the potential volumetric strain, which allows the estimation of the liquefaction resistance for partially saturated sand. The second is the matric suction of unsaturated sand which increases the effective stress and thus the strength of the soil mass. In this study two series of cyclic triaxial tests on non-plastic silt were carried out to observe the liquefaction resistance in both mechanisms. In the first series, a top cap with an accumulator tank was used to study the effect of compressibility of pore fluid on the liquefaction resistance. The empirical relationship derived by Okamura and Soga is found to be valid even for the silt provided that the matric suction is negligible. In the second test series an ordinary cap was used. The liquefaction resistance increased linearly with the matric suction, with the increasing ratio being higher than that for the net stress. A unique linear relationship is found between the normalized liquefaction resistance and the matric suction. Results are summarized in the form which can be easily applied to evaluate the liquefaction resistance of a partially saturated soil.

In the future, various types of foundations suitable for a variety of soils and applications should be accepted as an alternative to conventional flat foundations for the increase of bearing capacity and the savings of materials. The concept of shells is not new in foundation design, considering the construction with inverted brick arch foundation. Shell foundations are economic alternatives to conventional flat foundations where heavy superstructural or lateral loads are to be transmitted to weaker soils. Various types of foundations with different geometrical shapes have been extensively investigated in the structural design. However, the corresponding studies on the geotechnical design in terms of bearing capacity and deformation are scare. As such the advantages of various types of foundations have not yet been clarified in terms of the geotechnical design. The objective of this paper is to examine the overall geotechnical performance of various types of foundations on sand using model loading tests and the numerical limit analysis. The general superiority of various types of foundations has been revealed by comparing the loading tests with the analytical results.

Univ., Japan	This article addresses the numerical analysis of the load-settlement relation of footing on a soil ground by the finite difference method incorporating the subloading surface model. The subloading surface model is the elastoplastic constitutive model describing most pertinently the plastic strain rate due to the rate of stress inside the yield surface so as to fulfill the continuity and the smoothness conditions. For the finite difference program FLAC3D is used, which adopts the explicit dynamic relaxation method without solving the total stiffness matrix equation and thus has the capability for the remarkable reduction of calculation time. The relevance of the present approach to the description of the load-settlement curve exhibiting the ultimate load is demonstrated by the numerical experiments. Further, the applicability to the prediction of real behavior of footing-settlement is verified by comparison with the test data for sand grounds with a high friction property.

Aging effects on small strain shear moduli and liquefaction properties of in-situ frozen and reconstituted sandy soils	2009	Soils and Foundations	49	2		259	274		3	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-77951462015&partnerID=40&md5=0cc242fc2ebd8700d7c17a8ac68cc535	Tokyo University of Science, Japan; Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Japan	Kiyota, T., Tokyo University of Science, Japan; Koseki, J., Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Japan; Sato, T., Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Japan; Kuwano, R., Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Japan	In order to investigate the effects of different geological ages on liquefaction properties of sandy deposits, a series of undrained cyclic triaxial tests was performed on three kinds of in-situ frozen and their reconstituted samples which were retrieved from Holocene (Tone-river sand) and Pleistocene (Edo-river B and C sands) deposits. The specimens were subjected to isotropic consolidation at a specified confining stress which is equivalent to the in-situ overburden stress at the depth of sampling, and small strain shear moduli were measured before and during the undrained cyclic loading tests. The liquefaction properties and the small strain shear moduli were affected by not only the natural aging effect of the specimen but also the inter-locking effect that was enhanced by applying drained cyclic loading before the undrained cyclic loading tests. During liquefaction, different tendencies of degradation in the small strain shear moduli which would reflect the aging effects of the specimen were observed between Tone-river Holocene sand and Edo-river B and C Pleistocene sands. The applicability of reconstituted samples as substitutes for in-situ frozen samples was confirmed with Tone-river Holocene sand that has no cementation effect between soil particles, whereas it seems difficult to simulate fully the liquefaction behaviour of Edo-river B and C Pleistocene sands which have higher cementation effect.

Influence of the anisotropy of confining stress on the sand/steel interface behaviour in a cylinder shear apparatus	2009	Soils and Foundations	49	2		167	174		1	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-77951447217&partnerID=40&md5=1373cc8a15a09c4263b63e260634e046	CERMES, ENPC, Institut Navier, France	Dumitrescu, A.I., CERMES, ENPC, Institut Navier, France; Corfdir, A., CERMES, ENPC, Institut Navier, France; Frank, R., CERMES, ENPC, Institut Navier, France	According to the type of works and to the consolidation of the ground, soil-structure interfaces are orientated in various ways with respect to the stress tensor in the soil. For instance, before shearing, the normal stress applied to the interface could be the major stress in the soil or the minor one or some intermediate value. This paper shows how the anisotropy of confining stresses can influence the behaviour of sand/steel interface. To this end, a series of tests was conducted with the cylinder shear apparatus. The cylinder shear apparatus is dedicated to the study of the shear behaviour of ground/structure interfaces. This device controls the radial confining stress and an average axial confining stress. One is particularly interested in estimating the influence of anisotropy of confining stresses and to look for empirical laws clarifying this influence on the peak shear, the post-peak shear, the displacement needed for full mobilization. The influences of the roughness of the interface, of the density of the sample and of the level of confining stresses are also studied.

Based on the results from a series of shaking table model tests, the study found that subsoil and backfill deformations could be significant even in cases of dense model ground that cannot be evaluated by using Newmark's rigid sliding block analogy. In the proposed method, therefore, the effects of subsoil and backfill deformation were taken into account as well as the movement of the wall as a rigid mass, which was evaluated using Newmark's method. The deformation properties of the subsoil and backfill were modeled based on results from a series of laboratory soil tests and moment load tests. Simulations of shaking table model tests using the proposed method revealed that computed residual displacements agreed well with the measured ones even though the model tests were conducted under a wide variety of conditions.

The study consists of three parts; element tests on asphalt concrete, numerical analysis and some model tests. In the first part, a series of triaxial monotonic and cyclic tests were performed at the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI)'s laboratory to determine the geotechnical parameters of asphalt concrete. Then, numerical analyses were carried out for Garmrood dam in Iran with a height of 110 m. The different stages of construction and impounding were analyzed using a hyperbolic stress-strain model. The dynamic analysis was then performed using two different models; nonlinear elasto-plastic material model and an equivalent linear method followed by the Newmark approach to estimate the permanent displacements. Finally, some 1-g model shaking table tests were performed on a typical rockfill dam to have a qualitative picture of the modes of seismic behaviour of an asphaltic concrete core rockfill dam. Element tests result shows that the asphaltic concrete is resistant to earthquake excitations and the earthquake has to be very strong to cause any detrimental cracking or material degradation of the properties of a ductile asphaltic concrete. In addition, the obtained results from numerical analysis and model tests show the appropriate response of the dam during and after earthquake caused shaking.

Here, the Youd et al. (2001) method, a deterministic model for liquefaction triggering evaluation, is examined for its model uncertainty. The procedure for evaluating this model uncertainty involves two steps: 1) deriving a Bayesi-an mapping function based on a database of case histories, and 2) using the calibrated Bayesian mapping function as a reference to back-figure the uncertainty of the model. Details of the developed procedure within the framework of the first-order reliability method (FORM) are presented. Using FORM with the calibrated model uncertainty, the probability of liquefaction can be readily determined, and thus, the results presented in this paper extend the use of the Youd et al. (2001) method.

However due to the complexity of the compression process for a wide range of soil states, i.e., suspended, liquid, plastic, semisolid or solid states like rock, the interaction between the states or the transition from one state to another, there have often been misunderstandings and difficulties regarding the application of these theories. In this study, an ideal particle distribution in an ideal ground system is derived to find the equation of state, a general compression process for a wide variety of soil types and states. In other words, it is a general relationship between the void ratio and effective overburden pressure in terms of interparticle energy and is thus a law of soil. The principle is based on the law of energy distribution in statistical mechanics. The derived equations can be applied to describe the void ratio profile and the compression process of various soils. Case studies show that this theoretical approach agrees well with the experimental data obtained for several soils such as sediments, Mexican City clay, sand and others.

Strength and deformation of soft rocks under cyclic loading considering loading period effects	2009	Soils and Foundations	49	1		51	62		4	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-77649086494&partnerID=40&md5=afd44bd84cce796587f2f2872920b899	Department of Civil Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan	Peckley, D.C., Department of Civil Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Uchimura, T., Department of Civil Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan	Cost-effective design is the primary motivation for adopting the performance-based design method. This method, however, requires that deformations be reliably estimated. While soft rocks are known to be competent foundation materials for large-scale structures, the deformation characteristics of this material when subjected to large cyclic loadings still have to be understood. In this study, the strength and deformation characteristics of soft rocks under cyclic loadings were investigated by conducting cyclic triaxial tests on natural soft rock samples. The loading histories that were applied to these samples were uniform amplitude cyclic loadings with loading periods between 1 s and 9000 s. The tests revealed that the longer the loading period, the larger is the residual strain accumulated for a certain number of loading cycles. This dependency of residual strain accumulation on loading period appears to be an intrinsic material property which is irrespective of loading amplitude and water content. From this finding, it can be inferred that the prevailing practice of soft rock cyclic loading tests at 300 s and 9000 s of cyclic loading periods, which are much longer than that of earthquakes, can result in overestimated residual strains.

Role of fly ash on strength and microstructure development in blended cement stabilized silty clay	2009	Soils and Foundations	49	1		85	98		15	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-77649164927&partnerID=40&md5=577c773f21078793836809dc352cbbcd	Department of School of Civil Engineering, Construction Technology Research Unit, Suranaree University of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand; Department of Civil Engineering, Mahanakorn University of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand; School of Civil Engineering, Suranaree University of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand	Horpibulsuk, S., Department of School of Civil Engineering, Construction Technology Research Unit, Suranaree University of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand; Rachan, R., Department of Civil Engineering, Mahanakorn University of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand; Raksachon, Y., School of Civil Engineering, Suranaree University of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand	This paper presents the role of fly ash on strength and microstructure development in blended cement stabilized silty clay. Its strength was examined by unconfined compression test and its microstructure (fabric and cementation bond) by a scanning electron microscope (SEM), mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), and thermal gravity (TG) analysis. The flocculation of clay particles due to the cation exchange process is controlled by cement content, regardless of fly ash content. It increases dry unit weight of the stabilized clay with insignificant change in liquid limit. This results in irrelevant difference in optimum water content (OWC) for the unstabilized and the stabilized clay since OWC of low swelling silty clay is mainly controlled by liquid limit. It is found from the microstructural and the strength test results that the reactivity of fly ash (pozzolanic reaction) is minimal, which is different from concrete technology. This is possibly due to less amount of Ca(OH)2 to be consumed. The role of fly ash in cement stabilization is to disperse the large clay-cement clusters into smaller clusters. Consequently, the reactive surfaces to be interacted with water increase, and hence the cementitious products (inter-cluster cementation bond). To conclude, the strength development in the blended cement stabilized clay is controlled by cementitious products due to combined effect: hydration and dispersion. Cementitious products due to hydration are governed by cement content, while cementitious products due to dispersion by fly ash content and fineness. Water content of 1.20WC and 10% replacement ratio are regarded as the effective mixing condition for the stabilization, exhibiting the highest cementitious products.

The viscous properties of a wide variety of unbound granular materials (GMs) were evaluated by drained shear tests. The specimens were reconstituted ones that were loose or dense and air-dried or moist or saturated, of mostly natural sands and gravels, having different mean particle diameters, uniformity coefficients, fines contents, degrees of particle angularity and particle crushabilities. The tests were mostly triaxial compression (TC) tests and partly plane strain compression tests, both at fixed confining pressure, and direct shear tests at fixed normal pressure. The viscous properties of GMs were evaluated by stepwise changing the loading rate and performing sustained loading (SL) tests during otherwise monotonic loading (ML) at a constant loading rate. The viscous properties are characterised in terms of the rate-sensitivity coefficient (β), the viscosity type parameter (θ = βrβ) and the decay parameter (r1). Correlations among these parameters and effects of particle characteristics on these parameters are analysed. Creep strains are compared with residual strains by cyclic loading under otherwise the same TC conditions. As the particles become less angular, as the grading becomes more uniform and as the particles become less crushable, the viscosity type deviates more from the Isotach type (i.e.,θ= 1.0) changing toward the P&amp;Ntype (i.e., θ&gt; 0) associated with a decrease in β and ru while creep strains by SL decreases and residual strains by many unload/reload cycles increases.

The P2S effect on the accumulation of residual strains in soft rocks due to irregular cyclic loading	2009	Soils and Foundations	49	1		63	74		1	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-77649112731&partnerID=40&md5=d1289cc4a3537cb4ae6fa4f339e9b397	Department of Civil Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan	Peckley, D.C., Department of Civil Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Uchimura, T., Department of Civil Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan	Data and information on the cyclic loading behaviour of soft rocks, especially behaviour under irregular cyclic loading, are very limited. This paper shows that the present procedure of estimating residual strain accumulation due to irregular cyclic loading using a fatigue model from uniform amplitude cyclic loading can result in underestimated residual strains. Such underestimation occurs because the present procedure fails to take into account the so-called P2S effect on the softening behaviour of soft rocks under cyclic loading. The parameter P2S is defined as the sum of the magnitudes of the increments in residual strains due to the previous two loading half-cycles. When P2S is large, a large residual strain increment can be expected. This paper also shows that taking the P2S effect into account can improve the simulation of residual strain accumulation due to irregular cyclic loading.

Large-scale monotonic and cyclic tests of interface between geotextile and gravelly soil	2009	Soils and Foundations	49	1		75	84		4	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-77649122183&partnerID=40&md5=e2fecce3c2b2b3873eb71aeec8d8d450	State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China	Zhang, G., State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Zhang, J.M., State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China	A series of monotonic and cyclic shear tests, as well as pullout tests, were conducted on gravel-geotextile interfaces using a large-scale apparatus, with development of a new special pullout test element. The macroscopic response of stress and displacement, as well as the movement and crushing process of soil particles, were observed and measured. The interface exhibited evident strain-softening and aeolotropic normal displacement, which were significantly influenced by normal stress. Shear strength decreased and normal displacement increased with increasing number of shear cycles. Shear deformation was composed of slippage at the contact surface and deformation of the soil con strained by the geotextile; and the thickness was estimated at 5-6 times the average soil grain size. There was significant evolution of physical state due to shear application, including soil particle crushing and soil compression, as well as damage to the geotextile. The pullout test underestimated shear stiffness of the interface due to significant deformation of the geotextile itself. Shear strength increased with increasing normal stress, described by a logarithmic equation, according to the pullout tests, rather than the linear relationship obtained using direct shear tests. Therefore, an appropriate test method should be selected with careful consideration of the site conditions.

A series of model loading tests on a simulated lunar soil (lunar soil simulant) and Toyoura sand were conducted on an aircraft that flew in parabolic paths to generate partial gravity fields. As a result of the model tests, it became clear that bearing characteristics, including the coefficient of subgrade reaction and ultimate bearing capacity of the lunar soil simulant in a low gravity environment is hardly influenced by the gravity levels, while Toyoura sand exhibits a high dependence on gravity. From the observation of the failure mechanisms, it was found that the gravity dependence seems to correlate well with soil compressibility. To rationally explain the dependence of ultimate bearing capacity on gravity, theoretical evaluations were attempted in the framework of the upper bound method. The proposed calculation method not only makes it possible to correlate quantitatively the failure mode with dependence on gravity, but also may allow us to predict the ultimate bearing capacity in the lunar surface environment.

The paper briefly reviews a total of eight instrumented wall sections that can be used to estimate anchor loads at the end of construction. Measured loads are compared to predicted values using equations found in current design guidelines. The comparison shows that the current Japanese and UK design methods to compute anchor loads are reasonably accurate for walls with frictional backfills provided Ka is calculated using the Rankine equation. For walls with cohesive-frictional backfills, current design methods over-predict anchor loads by as much as a factor of two. The eccentricity term in current UK and Hong Kong design methods is shown to not improve the accuracy of load predictions and it is recommended that this additional complexity be removed from these equations. A new load equation is proposed and constant coefficients are back-fitted to measured anchor load data. The new method is demonstrated to give quantitatively better predictions of anchor loads based on the statistics for load bias values computed as the ratio of measured to predicted anchor loads at the end of construction.

The present study is aimed at examining the evaluation of undrained shear strength of silty sands from field with Swedish weight sounding tests and cone penetration tests. Based on the outcome of the previous studies on laboratory triaxial tests, the undrained shear strength ratio is defined as the undrained shear strength divided by the initial effective major principal stress. The undrained shear strength ratio is then formulated with respect to the relative density. The penetration resistances of Swedish weight sounding and cone penetration tests are then formulated with respect to the effective overburden stress and relative density, based on laboratory calibration chamber tests. By combining these formulations, the correlations of the undrained shear strength with Swedish penetration resistance and cone tip resistance are established. The range of values of penetration resistances indicative of soil layers susceptible to flow deformation is discussed. The correlations of the undrained shear strength with field penetration resistances thus derived are then examined from case history studies. Two case history studies are carried out with Swedish weight sounding tests at the sites of flow failures induced during the recent earthquakes. A series of case history studies are reexamined, which were carried out with Dutch cone penetration tests in the past studies.

The viscous properties were evaluated by stepwise changing the strain rate, ε̇, and performing sustained loading during otherwise monotonic loading (ML) at a constant ε̇ and also by performing ML tests at different constant values of ε̇. Four basic viscosity types, Isotach, Combined, TESRA (or Vis-cous Evanescent) and Positive &amp; Negative (P &amp; N), which were recently found are described. The Isotach type is the most classical one and, in the case of ML, the current viscous stress component is a function of instantaneous irreversible strain, εir and its rate, ε̇ir. So, the strength during ML at a constant ε̇ increases with ε̇. With the other three types, the viscous stress increment that has developed at a given moment, denoted as Δσv, decays with εir towards different residual values during subsequent ML. With the TESRA type, Δσ v decays eventually totally and the strength during ML at constant ε̇ is essentially independent of ε̇. With the Combined type, Δσv decays with εir like the TESRA type, but it does not decay totally. So, the strength during ML at constant ε̇ increases with ε̇ like the Isotach type. With theP&amp;N type, found latest, a positive value of Δσv decays towards a negative value. So, the strength during ML at constant ε̇ decreases with an increase in ε̇ . The viscosity type tends to change with εir: e.g., from Isotach toward TESRA and from TESRA toward P &amp; N. A general mathematical expression that can describe these four viscosity types and transitions among them is proposed. Numerical simulations of typical drained triaxial compression tests of geomaterials based on a non-linear three-component model incorporating the general expression of the viscous stress are presented.

The effect of fines on critical state and liquefaction resistance characteristics of non-plastic silty sands	2008	Soils and Foundations	48	5		713	725		6	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-72449160666&partnerID=40&md5=5d6351c77916b83192a9d88903d89336	Department of Civil Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece	Papadopoulou, A., Department of Civil Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece; Tika, T., Department of Civil Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece	Monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests were carried out on sand-silt mixtures for the investigation of the effect of fines content on their critical state and liquefaction resistance characteristics. Both the undrained and the drained monotonic tests produce a unique critical state line for each tested mixture, which moves downwards with increasing fines content up to a threshold value of 35% and then upwards. At a given void ratio and mean effective stress, the liquefaction resistance ratio decreases with increasing fines content up to the same threshold value of 35%, and increases thereafter with further increasing fines content. However, at a given intergranular void ratio, defined as the ratio of the volume of fines plus voids to that of sand particles, liquefaction resistance ratio increases with increasing fines content up to the threshold value. The threshold fines content value, which is an important parameter in determining the transition from the sand dominated to the silt dominated behaviour of sand-silt mixtures, is related to their particle packing. An expression is proposed for the estimation of the threshold fines content as a function of the mean diameter ratio, d50/D50, and the void ratio. The results, presented herein, also show that for each tested mixture the liquefaction resistance ratio is related to the state parameter and that this relation is influenced by the effective stress level and fines content. The results on the sand-silt mixtures are supported by similar results on natural silty sands.

Frictional pressure loss arising at the interface between the consolidation ring and the specimen must be considered, when the specimen thickness increases. This study uses a special oedometer that can evaluate the quantity of the frictional pressure loss. Incremental loading oedometer tests are carried out in order to evaluate the frictional pressure loss in the normal oedometer test using a specimen with a height of 20 mm. The frictional pressure loss ratio generally exceeds 0.2 when the consolidation pressure is less than approximately 300 kPa, rather than the overconsolidation range. Consequently, a series of inter-connected type consolidation tests, in which the frictional pressure loss can be minimized by limiting the thickness of each specimen element, are carried out in order to investigate the scale effect of the specimen thickness in the range of 20-200 mm. The end of primary consolidation (EOP) can be clearly identified in the excess pore pressure dissipation. The law of squared if is essentially valid for the pore water pressure dissipation. However, the EOP becomes unclear in the strains when the specimen thickness decreases. The compressive strain at the EOP stays constant or slightly increases with the specimen thickness.

Temperature and frequency effects on specimen behavior and on specimen degradation have been studied under the cyclic loads in both isotropic and anisotropic initial stress conditions. For investigation of the fatigue behavior, thousands of cyclic loads were imposed on some of the specimens. Moreover, to study any sign of material degradation due to the cyclic loading, the post-cyclic monotonic stress-strain curve was compared with the corresponding curve for specimens that were not first subjected to cyclic loading. Geotechnical parameters to be used in dynamic numerical analysis models are also presented. Copyright© 2005-2009 National Institute of Informatics.

The paper concerns the method developed in a series of laboratory model tests to experimentally determine p-y curves. Bending moment curves are differentiated by using curve fitting method of cubic polynomial function. The study includes effect of slope angle and relative density on bending moment, lateral soil resistance, lateral deflection and non-dimensional p-y curves. The non-dimensional p-y curves for piles on sloping ground under surcharge load are developed modifying API RP 2A (2000) method by including a Reduction Factor (R) using the experimental results.

In order to identify the frequency response of testing apparatus, bender element tests using frequency-swept signals are performed. Received waves for one-period sine pulse transmitting with various frequencies are calculated and compared with observed waves in several kinds of soil samples and testing apparatuses. The linearity of the testing system is also confirmed by coherence function. It is shown that calculated data are less affected by random noise and show good agreement with observed data in regards to not only waveform itself but also resulting shear wave velocity. It is mentioned that this technique can provide simulations for arbitrary transmitted waveform with high signal/noise ratio after laboratory tests are performed. It is also mentioned that this technique is advantageous when sufficient amplitude of received wave cannot be ensured or shear wave velocity must be verified, for example, due to uncertainty of arrival time by near-field effect.

For undisturbed volcanic ash soils, recent studies have shown that a linear Dp(va) model, taking into account inactive air-filled pore space (threshold soil-air content, va, th) captured the Dp data across the total soil moisture range from wet to completely dry conditions. In this study, we developed a simple, easy to apply, and still accurate linear D p(Va) model for undisturbed volcanic ash soils. The model slope C and intercept (interpreted as (va, th) were derived using the classical Buckingham (1904) Dp(va) power-law model, va X, at two soil-water matric potentials of pF 2 (near field capacity condition) and pF 4.1 (near wilting point condition), and assuming the same value for the Buckingham exponent (X=2.3) in agreement with measured data. This linear Dp(va) prediction model performed better than the traditionally-used non-linear Dp(v a) models, especially at dry soil conditions, when tested against several independent data sets from literature. Model parameter sensitivity analysis on soil compaction effects showed that a decrease in slope C and v a, th due to uniaxial reduction of air-filled pore space in between aggregates markedly affects the magnitude of soil-gas diffusivity. We recommend the new Dp(va) model using only the soil-air contents at two soil-water matric potential conditions (field capacity and wilting point) for a rapid assessment of the entire Dp-vafunction.

Illustrative simulations of rate-dependent stress-strain behaviour of geomaterial under typical laboratory test conditions were performed to analyse the structure of the model. The versatility of the proposed model and its applicability to a wide variety of shear loading histories is examined and demonstrated by these simulations. The following results are shown. Commonly with different basic viscosity types, Isotach, TESRA and P&N, the viscous stress component has a positive component that increases with an increase in the irreversible strain rate, which makes feasible stable and realistic simulations of rate-dependent stress-strain behaviour, including creep deformation, based on the proposed model. With different unbound granular material types having similar relative densities, the creep strain in TC tests and creep shear displacement in DS tests that develop by sustained loading at a given shear stress level for a given period tends to decrease with an increase in the particle roundness. This trend of behaviours is explained by a decrease in the viscosity type parameter, θ, associated with an increase in the particle roundness based on the simulations of these tests.

Ltd., Japan	The time effects on the stress-strain behaviour of geomaterial consist of effects of loading rate and ageing. The positive ageing effects are analysed based on the results from drained triaxial compression (TC) tests on cement-mixed kaolin and well-graded gravelly soil and incorporated into a non-linear three-component model that can simulate the elasto-viscoplastic behaviour of geomaterials. The inviscid yielding is controlled by the inviscid yield stress that develops basically by irreversible straining and time elapsing following, respectively, a basic inviscid strain-hardening function and an ageing function. The inviscid yield stress may develop additionally by positive interaction between ageing and inviscid yielding following an interaction function, which expresses an additional strength gain by longer ageing at higher shear stress levels. Positive interaction effects are damaged by subsequent irreversible straining following a damage function. These functions are formulated based on experimental results. Illustrative model simulations are presented to describe the structure of the proposed model. The model is validated by simulating drained TC tests exhibiting significant effects of loading rate and ageing.

In the tests, cyclic shear strain was applied to fine clean sand with the same dry density but different initial suction states under the undrained condition. During cyclic shear, the volume change of the soil particle skeleton, the pore air pressure and the pore water pressure were measured continuously. Having used the effective stress defined by Bishop (Bishop et al., 1963), where the net stress and suction contribute to the effective stress, our test results showed that unsaturated sand specimens with quite a low degree of saturation lose their effective stress due to cyclic shear. At a zero effective stress state, unsaturated specimens behaved similarly to liquids in much the same way as saturated specimens. From experimental and theoretical considerations, the zero effective stress state (i.e., liquefaction) for unsaturated sand was found to have been established when both the pore air and water pressures build up to the point where it is equal to the initial total pressure. A volume change of pore air under the undrained condition, if a volume change of pore water is negligible, is equal to that of the soil particle skeleton. Therefore, it can be concluded that the liquefaction of unsaturated soil generally depends on the volume compressibility of the soil particle skeleton and the degree of saturation. On the other hand, according to the ideal gas equation of Boyle-Charles law, the volume change required to bring about a zero effective stress state can be calculated from the initial pore air pressure (usually the atmospheric pressure) and the final pore air pressure (the initial confining pressure). Therefore, the liquefaction of unsaturated soils also depends on the initial confining pressure. Based on this concept, the liquefaction potential of unsaturated soil can be evaluated by comparing the volume compressibility of the soil particle skeleton and the volume change of the pore air required to bring about a zero effective stress state.

Moreover, the anisotropic permeability test was performed to those three kinds of specimens. Then, a s-eries of cyclic simple shear tests was conducted on the specimens of HY and WT to investigate the dynamic deformation properties of the sand. The influence of fabric orientation for each kind of specimens to both permeability and dynamic deformation properties were discussed based on the testing results. It is observed that the difference in fabric orientation of the testing soil given by various sample preparation methods results in the difference of permeability and liquefaction resistance. On the other hand, the strength as well as deformation properties obtained by different shearing apparatus appear to have different results. Nevertheless, from the viewpoint of fabric orientation with respect to flowing direction and shearing force direction, an identical conclusion can be obtained. These phenomena demonstrate that the anisotropic characteristics of the soil have significant effect on the permeability, shearing strength and deformation behavior.

Effects of water content distribution on hydraulic conductivity of prehydrated GCLS against calcium chloride solutions	2008	Soils and Foundations	48	3		407	417		3	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-70849099460&partnerID=40&md5=d515111605403e368cc3a7f1174cc4ba	Graduate School of Global Environmental Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Department of Civil Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Japan	Katsumi, T., Graduate School of Global Environmental Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Ishimori, H., Department of Civil Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Japan; Ogawa, A., Department of Civil Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Japan; Maruyamam, S., Department of Civil Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Japan; Fukagawaiv, R., Department of Civil Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Japan	When geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) are applied as bottom liners at waste containment facilities, they are naturally prehydrated by absorbing moisture in the underlying base layers. In order to evaluate the effects of cations contained in waste leachates, this study investigated the effects of the water content distribution of the GCLs prehydrated with actual soils on their hydraulic conductivities against CaCl 2 solutions. The prehydration tests, which were conducted prior to the hydraulic conductivity tests, showed that the water content distribution of the prehydrated GCLs depends on the properties of the GCLs and the base layers. In particular, drastic differences between GCLs with powdered ben-tonite and GCLs with granular bentonite were observed in the prehydration water content and its distribution. Prehydrated GCLs with powdered bentonite had a higher water content and a more homogenous distribution than those with granular bentonite. The hydraulic conductivity tests showed that most of the prehydrated GCLs exhibit a low hydraulic conductivity of k ≈1.0 x 10 -8cm/s against CaCl 2 solutions with 0.1-0.5 M. However, GCLs with granular bentonite may be difficult to homogeneously prehydrate and exhibit an unstable hydraulic conductivity, which varies from A: = 2.9x 10 -9cm/s to k= 1.5 x 10 -6 cm/s. The homogeneity of the water content distribution has been consi-dered an important factor to obtain a required barrier performance under prehydration conditions, which are naturally generated in actual sites.

Local tensile strains in the reinforcement were measured by using two types of strain gauges. Sustained loading (SL) under fixed boundary stress conditions and cyclic loading (CL) tests were performed during otherwise monotonic loading at a constant strain rate to evaluate the development of creep deformation by SL and residual deformation by CL of geosynthetic-reinforced sand and also residual strains in the reinforcement by these loading histories. It is shown that the creep deformation of geosynthetic-reinforced sand develops due to the viscous properties of both sand and geosynthetic reinforcement, while the residual deformation of geosynthetic-reinforced sand during CL (defined at the peak stress state during CL) consists of two components: i) the one by the viscous properties of sand and reinforcement; and ii) the other by rate-independent cyclic loading effects with sand. The development of residual deformation of geosynthetic-reinforced sand by SL and CL histories had no negative effects on the subsequent stress-strain behaviour and the compressive strength was maintained as the original value or even became larger by such SL and CL histories. The local tensile strains in the geosynthetic reinforcement arranged in the sand specimen subjected to SL decreased noticeably with time, due mainly to lateral compressive creep strains in sand during SL of geosynthetic- reinforced sand. This result indicates that, with geosynthetic-reinforced soil structures designed to have a sufficiently high safety factor under static loading conditions because of seismic design, it is overly conservative to assume that the tensile load in the geosynthetic reinforcement is maintained constant for long life time. Moreover, during CL of geosynthetic-reinforced sand, the residual tensile strains in the geosynthetic reinforcement did not increase like global strains in the geosynthetic-reinforced sand that increased significantly during CL. These different trends of behaviour were also due to the creep compressive strains in the lateral direction of sand that developed during CL of geosynthetic-reinforced sand.

Formulation of A dusty gas model for multi-component diffusion in the gas phase of soil	2008	Soils and Foundations	48	3		419	432		4	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-70849114470&partnerID=40&md5=e8bdcd5ab588954c821f4bdc0577ffd1	Department of Environmental Science and Technology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Meijo University, Nagoya, Japan	Hlbi, Y., Department of Environmental Science and Technology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Meijo University, Nagoya, Japan	Soil vapor extraction and bio-venting have been utilized for purification of contaminated soil or groundwater. It is necessary to predict the movement of gas phase components in soil for the design of soil vapor extraction and bio-venting systems. Though chemical substances migrate with advection and diffusion in gas phase of soil, we investigated multi-component diffusion systems in gas phase of soil. Numerical modeling for multi-component diffusion is useful to the prediction of the movement of components. A dusty gas model for multi-component diffusion systems has not so far been formulated by the Finite Element Method; furthermore it has not been applied for assessing the movement of components in the gas phase of soil. Accordingly, a dusty gas model for three gas phase components was formulated by the Finite Element Method in this study, and the concentrations of components in binary and multi-component gas systems were calculated by numerical methods developed in this study. As a result, it was found that the dusty gas model must be applied for study of diffusion in a multi-component gas system; and the study showed that the difference between molecular weights of gas phase components influenced the movement of components in the gas system.

Due correction was made for the effect of membrane force on the measured shear stress. After exceeding a certain level of overall shear strain, the specimen deformation became non-uniform, which is called as strain localization in the present study. The initiation of such localization was associated with the changes in the cyclic amplitude of deviator stress and the increment of shear strain. In the case of Toyoura sand, the limiting value of shear strain to initiate strain localization was found to increase with decrease in the relative density, and such a trend was consistent with the empirical correlation of soil liquefaction when the relative density is higher than 30%. In the case of in-situ frozen sandy samples, their limiting shear strain values were smaller than those of the reconstituted specimens, suggesting that their soil structures were different from each other under different degrees of natural aging effects.

Most of these studies are aimed at calculating the secondary consolidation with high accuracy in order to evaluate the long-term settlement of large structures. In this study, as the first step toward improving the accuracy of the evaluation of long-term settlement at the Kansai International Airport, the consolidation characteristics of Osaka Bay clay are examined and organized based on the isotache concept. This study proposes a simplified model based on the isotache concept by using a compression curve and the relationship between the consolidation yield stress and the strain rate. The former and the latter are obtained from the constant rate of strain consolidation (CRS) tests and long term consolidation (LT) tests, respectively. The latter is expressed by an equation with three isotache parameters. This model is very practical because it requires a minimum of only one CRS test and one LT test. It is widely applicable to the Osaka Bay clay. The isotache parameters used in this model can be commonly deter-mined for the Osaka Bay clays retrieved from various depths at the Kansai International Airport.

The formulations are derived on the basis of a new model framework, with test-basis concepts and assumptions, for a unified description of monotonic and cyclic behavior of such an interface. The model parameters, with physical meaning, are easily determined from a group of cyclic shear tests and a confining compression test. The comparisons of model predictions with the results for a series of tests under varying loading conditions demonstrate that the EPDI model is effective in accurate description of monotonic and cyclic stress-strain relationship of the interface between a structure and gravelly soil with capturing new features, including: 1) shear stress-strain relationship and comprehensive volumetric strain response (e.g., partly dependent on shear strain); 2) volumetric strain response that is dependent on the shear direction; and 3) evolution of behavior of the interface associated with the evolution of physical state.

The prediction of lateral buckling in design requires accurate assessment of the lateral breakout resistance. This Technical Note describes upper bound plasticity analysis of a partially-embedded pipe on undrained soil. The purpose is to generate failure envelopes for vertical and horizontal loading to provide a theoretical basis for estimating breakout resistance. The following cases have been considered: smooth and rough pipes, with and without separation at the rear face of the pipe. The envelopes are similar to those developed previously for surface foundations, but capture additional effects that are due to the curved geometry of the pipe surface. The breakout resistance and the movement of the pipe at failure are strongly influenced by the separation condition. Pipe roughness and soil self-weight have a relatively minor effect on breakout resistance. Existing empirical expressions usually assume a linear variation in breakout resistance with embedment and vertical load. This theoretical analysis demonstrates that these relationships are non-linear. The resulting envelopes provide a more rigorous basis for predicting the breakout resistance of partially-embedded pipelines. Copyright © 2005-2009 National Institute of Informatics.

Sensitivity analyses of model parameters are also conducted. Results show that three-dimensional creep analysis, although very time-consuming, is necessary in order to obtain more realistic numerical results. Creep effects have been found to account for 1.5 degrees out of the total 5.5 degrees inclination. Creep causes stress states in the clay layers to move away from the critical state line. It was also found that the deformation behaviour of the soil is not sensitive to any specific parameters. This helps to clarify that the total tilting angle of 5.5 degrees cannot be achieved by creeping of the soil. There must be other reasons that also contribute to the tilting of the tower, which cannot be considered by the constitutive model. Nevertheless, the current study could calculate the tilting history of the tower within reasonable accuracy during its construction period and illustrate more or less, the same trend as observed through the last four centuries. The model could also match the observed maximum settlement on top of the upper clay layers extremely well. Therefore, this study provides considerable insight into the deformation history of the soil and the stresses that are likely to exist in the soil.

Ltd., Japan	In order to directly evaluate the effects of soil improvement by the Sand Compaction Pile (SCP) method on the density, deformation, and static and liquefaction strength characteristics of sandy soils, a series of field and laboratory tests were performed. Laboratory tests were performed on high-quality undisturbed samples obtained from sandy soils both before and after soil improvement by the SCP method. The high-quality undisturbed samples were recovered by the in-situ freezing sampling method. The drained shear strength (internal friction angle, φ d), liquefaction strength (R 15: cyclic stress ratio needed to cause 5% double amplitude axial strain in 15 cycles), and cyclic deformation characteristics (G∼ y and h∼y relations) were determined by performing a series of laboratory tests on the undisturbed samples. Both the in-situ density and the relative density were measured on the undisturbed samples used in the laboratory tests. A standard penetration test (SPT) and a suspension-type P-S wave logging test were performed to investigate the soil profile of the test site before and after the sand compaction. Both the static and the liquefaction strengths of the sandy soils obtained in the laboratory tests were also compared with those estimated by empirical correlations used in practice based on the SPT N-value and soil gradations.

A macro-element approach is revised assuming elasto-uplift-plastic behavior, in which uplifting and coupling effects of vertical, horizontal, and moment loads are taken into account. Large-scale shake table experiments of model pier footings are also conducted and simulated using the revised macro-element model. The numerical result reveals that the shape of the hysteresis loops for coupled load-displacement relationships is predicted very well, including the effects of uplift. In addition, the revised model can account for settlement with some inclination that has accumulated during the excitation.

Numerical analysis of time-dependent behaviour for the leaning tower of pisa	2008	Soils and Foundations	48	2		207	220		1	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-70949095550&partnerID=40&md5=7169cc08b3c9ed528d9ecba65492466c	Engineering Department, The Metropolitian Water Reclamation of Greater Chicago, Chicago, United States; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada	Bai, J., Engineering Department, The Metropolitian Water Reclamation of Greater Chicago, Chicago, United States; Chan, D., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada; Morgenstern, N., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada	This study investigates the significance of the creep characteristic in the deformation behaviour of the Pisa Tower through the simulation of creep tests as well as plane strain analyses conducted under non-creep and creep conditions. Creep effects account for up to 1.7 degrees of tilting and one meter of settlement. In addition, creep increases the mean effective stresses and decreases the deviatoric stresses in the clay layers. An extensive model parameter sensitivity study shows that the deformation behaviour of the Tower is not controlled by any specific model parameter, but each model parameter becomes more sensitive under high stress level. The total tilt of 5.5 degrees could not be achieved by simply changing the values of model parameters. Other factors may have also contributed to the deformation of the tower, which could not be considered by the current model.

In the approach, the adjusted cyclic stress ratio is calculated with a recent formula created by Idriss and Boulanger, and the cyclic resistance ratio is determined as a function of both adjusted cone tip resistance (qtlN) and soil behavior type index (I c). The new method is established through artificial neural network learning of documented cases. One unique feature of this method is the inclusion of excess porewater pressure ratio (B q) in the formulation of I c as per Jefferies and Davies. The proposed method is shown to be more applicable to a wider range of soils, including geomaterials that were previously considered too clay-rich to liquefy. The ability of this method to delineate liquefied cases from non-liquefied cases is clearly depicted with 3-D and 2-D graphs. Case studies of selected ground failure sites in Adapazari using the proposed method yield results that agree well with field observations in the 1999 Kocaeli earthquake.

On the other hand, it is emphasized that the adoption of the linear relation of void ratio vs. logarithm of pressure is impertinent for the constitutive equation describing the finite deformation although it is most widely used for constitutive equations of soils.

Undrained end bearing capacity of an improved soil berm in an excavation	2008	Soils and Foundations	48	3		433	445		1	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-70849093063&partnerID=40&md5=d853c174512e98d4dbec9811f84101f2	Centre for Soft Ground Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore	Zhang, Y.D., Centre for Soft Ground Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; Tan, T.S., Centre for Soft Ground Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; Leung, C.F., Centre for Soft Ground Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore	For a wide excavation in soft soil, the excavation can be stabilized by an embedded improved soil berm to increase wall stability and control soil movement. An embedded stiff berm essentially behaves like a horizontal pile subjected to a load applied by the retaining wall and derives its resistance to horizontal movement from both end bearing and inter-facial shear resistance on the top and bottom of the berm. This resistance helps to restrain the wall from moving inwards to the excavated side. However, to date, there is no known reported literature on the determination of the un-drained ultimate bearing capacity of such a berm, especially for the unit end bearing, ?h. In this paper, the undrained end bearing of an improved berm under a. plane strain condition was determined. The undrained end bearing capacity was first derived using a solution from a proposed upper bound analysis based on observations from centrifuge tests and then modified, taking on the basis of an equivalent finite element analyses. The proposed end bearing capacity factor Nc lies between the upper bound and lower bound solutions. The solution showed that the undrained end bearing capacity is not a constant but decreases during the excavation process. Furthermore, it was shown that the existence of an improved soil berm will provide an additional pressure relative to the passive pressure to control the wall displacement.

This modified formulation is based on smoothed discretisation of the pile surface using Bezier polynomials. The finite element code based on this formulation is then used to analyse the loading of piles with enlarged ends of different shapes. Very simple material models are used to represent the behaviour of the soil and the pile. The numerical predictions are compared with the laboratory measurements. It is demonstrated that the new finite element formulation can produce reasonable results for the pile loading problem that involves large interfacial sliding and surface separation.

Stationary piston sampling was carried out to obtain high quality undisturbed soil samples for laboratory tests and reliable engineering characteristics of the clay. It was assumed for the design of PVD spacing and preloading that the ratio of apparent value of horizontal coefficient of consolidation c h(ap)to vertical coefficient of consolidation c v is equal to 1.0. The settlement monitored in the field, which clearly showed that the actual settlement was faster than expected, resulted in the c h(ap) value 1.5 times as much as cv determined by the laboratory test.

In this paper, we propose methods to evaluate in-situ strength and dilatancy of sandy soils based on cone penetration test (CPT) results. It takes into account the silt content, relative density and stress state of the sand. A series of laboratory test results from fundamental property tests and triaxial tests are analyzed to develop methods for in-situ evaluation of strength and dilatancy for sands. Based on test results, modified and simplified dilatancy equations, in terms of the cone penetration resistance qc and intrinsic soil variables, are proposed. Results from proposed and original dilatancy indexes show close agreements for various soil conditions. Values of intrinsic variables for the proposed dilatancy relationships were proposed as a function of silt content. Based on TX test results, a direct CPT-based correlation, applicable to both clean and silty sands, is proposed as well. In order to verify the proposed methods, calibration chamber CPT results obtained in this study and collected from the literature are adopted. It is observed that the results from the proposed methods show good agreement with the measured results.

The results from the simplified slip line analysis are compared with those by Prater and results from numerical modeling. It is found that Prater's method may give surprising results and the limitations of Prater's results are also discussed in this paper. The authors have also investigated the importance of the lateral stress coefficient and the lower bound of the coefficient which are not considered in the past.

A number of natural sands having different particle shapes and sizes as well as uniform glass beads having different particle sizes were used. The viscous properties were evaluated by changing the shear displacement rate many times during otherwise monotonic loading (ML) at constant shear displacement rate and normal pressure. Creep loadings were performed in two tests. Different types of viscous properties, which are affected by the particle shape but essentially independent of the particle size, are reported. The viscosity type varies as the shear displacement increases from the pre-peak regime towards the residual state. A new viscosity type, called Positive &amp; Negative, was found with relatively round granular materials in the pre-peak regime and with relatively angular granular materials in the post-peak softening regime and at the residual state. Peculiar rate-independent unstable behaviour is observed with round natural sands and glass beads in the post-peak regime, which is more significant and frequent with glass beads. Controlled by the particle size, this behaviour is caused by the so-called stick/slip phenomenon. The viscous properties observed in the DS tests are quantified by the rate-sensitivity coefficient denned in terms of the shear and normal stresses, which are then converted to those defined in terms of the major and minor principal stresses, β13. These β13 values are consistent with those directly obtained by the triaxial and plane strain compression tests. The effects of particle size on the β13. value are negligible and the β13. value tends to decrease as the particle shape becomes more round.Copyright© 2005-2009 National Institute of Informatics.

The tests were performed on dense, air pluviated sand with loading frequencies of 0.1 and 1.5 Hz at varying confining pressures, cyclic shear stresses, and peak shear stresses. Under certain loading conditions, the frequency of loading did have a noticeable effect on the response of the sand; larger axial sAtrains were measured in the samples that were subjected to the lower frequency of loading. This difference in response measured at the two loading frequencies occurred mainly in the first few cycles of loading, when the difference in the strain rates was the greatest. Conditions that resulted in larger axial strains, such higher stress levels and larger cyclic shear stresses, also resulted in a greater difference between the axial strains measured at the two loading frequencies.

In this framework, this paper addresses a unified thermo-mechanical experimental study of saturated and unsaturated states and, in so doing, contributes to the understanding of the non-isothermal mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils. The present experimental program has been carried out on a sandy silt called Sion silt using two thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) cells, one isotropic and one oedometric. The characteristics of these two cells are briefly presented, as well as the THM paths followed. The main results are presented and interpreted in the light of a suitable THM constitutive framework. The compressibility of the soil tested appears not to be affected by the temperature but decreases with a suction increase. As far as the apparent preconsolidation stress is concerned, the results show a decrease of the yield limit with increasing temperature, while a suction increase tends to enhance this limit. Finally, an analytical expression is proposed to describe the evolution of the apparent preconsolidation stress with respect to temperature and suction.

Nakano M., Yamada E.	Ground improvement of intermediate reclaimed land by compaction through cavity expansion of sand piles	2008	Soils and Foundations	48	5		653	671		7	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-72449150183&partnerID=40&md5=a01cc0dfe61f6be4e3a8e87991522ca5	Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya University, Japan	Nakano, M., Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya University, Japan; Yamada, E., Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya University, Japan	The crushed Tertiary Period mudstone used as the geomaterial for the artificial reclaimed land in the Joetsu Region of Japan consists of coarse and fine fractions of about 50% each and is classified as an intermediate soil. Unlike sand or clay soils, no constitutive equations or sufficiently established design methods have been available until now for evaluating intermediate soils. This paper first utilizes the SYS Cam-clay model (Asaoka et al., 2002) to identify the soil profile of intermediate reclaimed land through comparison of laboratory test results with the calculated responses of the constitutive equation. Next, the soil profile obtained is used to carry out various soil-water coupled finite deformation analyses. The main conclusions reached are as follows: 1) The rates of decay/collapse of the soil structure, loss of overconsolidation, and evolution of anisotropy of the soil materials that constitute the Joetsu reclaimed land lie midway between those of typical sand and clay. 2) Ground improvement by cavity expansion of sand piles is effective in converting the reclaimed land from a highly structured ground having heavier overconsolidation to a lightly overconsolidated ground with a low degree of structure by increasing the confining pressures within the ground. In particular, the reduction in the specific volume of the soil elements in the vicinity of the sand piles becomes large. 3) In the case of small vertical displacement, the composite ground containing the sand piles exhibits a bearing capacity of about 1.5 times that of an unimproved ground, and in the case of large displacement, the bearing capacity is about 2 times larger.

A new method for a slope stability analysis, taking the effects of the IASIA method (Inherent And Stress Induced Anisotropies) into consideration, is proposed. The applicability of the IASIA method and the optimum embankment design are examined through case histories of embankment failures on soft soils. The undrained strength anisotropy cannot be estimated by parameters such as the I p value because of the complicated relationship with the factors influencing undrained anisotropic strength. It must be directly measured. The IASIA method was recommended from a study of a failed embankment. The probability of failure (P f) and consumer's risk (P c) from half of the unconfined compressive strength (q u/2) were (2.5̃25. 5)% and (4.7̃42 .3)% less than those of the Iwai q u/2 (IASIA) and Urayasu q u/2 (IASIA). Therefore, the design results were underestimated by disregarding strength anisotropies. If, P f and P c were considered, the C t values increased. However, the P c values drastically decreased to 24.8% from 54.3% concerning the 75-mm sampler and n increased, thus avoiding latent risks.

Adopting a new hardening parameter with the crushing stress, an jlastoplastic constitutive model considering sand crushing is proposed. Comparing the conventional triaxial compression test results with the model prediction, it shows that the proposed model can reasonably describe the dilatancy of sand from positive to negative.

This model simulates the distribution of bending moments of the pile by using a composite function of which the upper part is modeled by a polynomial and the lower part is modeled by the characteristic function of an analytical solution for a semi-infinite pile supported by uniform Winkler soil springs. Through successive regressive analyses, the optimal composite function obtained can effectively simulate the pile responses including the deflections, bending moments, shear forces, and the associated soil reactions. For verification, both the solution of a finite element analysis and the results of an in-situ load test have been adopted and the results of regressive analyses can satisfactorily obtain the pile responses. In addition, on the basis of curves of pile deflection and soil reaction deduced from the results of the pile test, a set of site-specific p-y curves can thus be established. Finally, a parametric study has shown that accurate estimate of moment-curvature relationship of a pile section is essential to the accuracy of the deduced pile internal forces, soil reactions, and p-y curves.

A set of monotonic loading (ML) tests were performed at different constant values of vertical (axial) strain rate, ε̇. The έ value was stepwise changed many times and several sustained loading (SL) tests were performed during otherwise ML at a constant ev in other tests. A number of SL tests were performed during global unload and reload cycles to infer the stress-strain relation when ε̇= 0. The elastic properties were evaluated by applying minute unload/reload cycles during otherwise ML. The rate-dependent stress-strain behaviour observed in these tests was described by an elasto-viscoplastic model (i.e., a non-linear three-component model), for which the vertical (axial) stress, σv, consists of inviscid and viscous components, σ fvand σvv, while ev consists of elastic and irreversible components, ε̇cvand ε̇irv.It is shown that the viscous property of EPS geofoam is of Isotach type in that, under the loading conditions where ε̇irvis always positive, the current &lt;7v value is a unique function of instantaneous εirvand ε̇irv, therefore the strength increases with εv. This viscous property was quantified based on the test results and incorporated into the model. The rate-dependent stress-strain behaviour, including the creep behaviour, observed in the experiment is simulated very well by the proposed model. In particular, the fact that the creep strain becomes significant when the sustained σv, value becomes larger than the inviscid yield vertical stress is well simulated.

Bearing capacity of shallow skirted foundations in compression is moderately well understood while there is still considerable uncertainty over uplift capacity, particularly for loading sustained over a period of time. This paper reports results from beam centrifuge tests on a shallow skirted foundation in clay, subjected to uplift and compression. Rapid and sustained loading is considered and the effects of consolidation stress level and stress history on undrained capacity and sustained load response are reported.

Two series of tests were conducted, which were continuous monotonic loading (ML) tests and ML tests intervened by sustained creep loading and minute cycles of unload and reload. Relatively small vertical and horizontal strains were locally measured by means of a pair of local deformation transducers (LDTs) and a set of three clip gauges, respectively. The paramount importance of measuring local strains in compression tests on EPS to reliably evaluate its stress-strain properties, in particular those at relatively small strains, is demonstrated. The initial modulus, E0, and Poisson's ratio, v0, were evaluated from initial stress-strain relations at small strains obtained by these ML tests. The tangent parameters, Etan and vtan, were also evaluated from the ML stress-strain behaviour. The equivalent parameters, Eeq and v eq, were evaluated from the stress-strain behaviour during minute cycles of unload and reload. The stress-strain behaviour is essentially linear only at small strains, and it becomes highly non-linear and a significant drop of stiffness occurs as observed in the overall stress-strain behaviour. The Poisson's ratio for inelastic deformation is found to be negative. Copyright © 2005-2009 National Institute of Informatics.

This paper deals with the development of a practical method of assessing laboratory compaction curves of fine-grained soils. It is found that for a given fine-grained soil compacted at a particular compaction energy, the relationships between water content (w) and degree of saturation (S) are represented by power function, which are w = AdSBd and w=AwS Bw for the dry and the wet sides of optimum, respectively (where Ad, Aw, Bd and Bw are constant). The Bd and Bw values and optimum degree of saturation (ODS) are mainly dependent upon soil type irrespective of compaction energy. The Ad and Aw values decrease with the logarithm of compaction energy and the decrease rates are practically the same for any compacted fine-grained soil. This leads to a simple and rational method to assess the compaction curve wherein the compaction energy varies over a wide range using a one point test (a single test). Assuming that fine-grained soils compacted under standard Proctor energy behave in agreement with Ohio's curves, the modified Ohio's curves for the other three compaction energy levels (296.3, 1346.6 and 2693.3 kJ/m3) are developed based on the proposed method. These curves can be used to assess the entire compaction curves at the required compaction energy based on a single set data of dry unit weight and water content.

Mechanical behavior of bentonite-sand mixtures as buffer materials	2008	Soils and Foundations	48	3		363	374		4	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-70849097485&partnerID=40&md5=95ab0553df7032e4e1b0ea940de93376	Department of Civil Engineering, Nihon University, Japan; Hokkaido University, Japan	Mltachi, T., Department of Civil Engineering, Nihon University, Japan, Hokkaido University, Japan	For the purpose of establishing the method for estimating in-situ mechanical behavior of artificial buffer materials, stress-deformation behavior of bentonite-sand mixtures were investigated through oedometer test, consolidated un-drained triaxial compression test and expansive stress-strain measuring test by changing the clay content as 30, 50, 70 and 100%, and by changing the range of initial dry density of mixture from 1.4 to 1.8 g/cm 3. Oedometer test results suggest that the magnitude of consolidation yield stress almost coincides with the maximum expansive stress (Ṕ s)max irrespective of bentonite-sand mix proportion, initial density of mixture and the magnitude of molding stress at the specimen making. Strong correlation between consolidation stress and initial tangent modulus during undrained triaxial compression test is observed, and it is found that the reduction rate of rigidity is hardly dependent on the specimen making method, molding stress and the consolidation stress. From the two series of expansive stress-strain measuring tests, it is recommended to perform the measurement of expansive stress by feed back system with the load cell installed at the base of the specimen. A unique relationship is found between the maximum expansive stress (Ṕ s)max versus bentonite specific volume vb, which is defined as the specific volume calculated by excluding the volume of sand particles. The line showing the unique log vb versus log (Ṕ s)max relationship can be recognized as the state boundary line prescribing one-dimensional expansive stress-strain behavior of the bentonite-sand mixtures.

Prediction of lateral effective stresses in sand using artificial neural network	2008	Soils and Foundations	48	2		141	153		5	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-70849084929&partnerID=40&md5=1872e0542c03415977e7ae5fdc169c7d	Department of Civil Engineering, University of Cukurova, Turkey; Department of Civil Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Turkey; Department of Civil Engineering, University of Erciyes, Turkey	Uncuoglu, E., Department of Civil Engineering, University of Cukurova, Turkey; Laman, M., Department of Civil Engineering, University of Cukurova, Turkey; Saglamer, A., Department of Civil Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Turkey; Kara, H.B., Department of Civil Engineering, University of Erciyes, Turkey	Predicting the lateral effective stress and the coefficient of lateral earth pressure at rest values is an important task in geotechnical engineering since it is used in the design and analysis of earth retaining structures, slope stability, piles and pier foundations. It needs sophisticated test procedures. The laboratory and in situ tests are also expensive and time consuming. In this study, an artificial neural network model is developed to predict the σh?, lateral effective stress in co-hesionless soils. Back propagation neural networks are used for function approximation and model has been trained by Levenberg-Marqurdt (LM) learning algorithm. The data used in the running of network models have been obtained from extensive series of oedometer tests on Kilyos, Ayvalik and Yalikoy sands. Tests were carried out on loose, medium dense and dense state of compactness in normal loading, unloading and reloading conditions. The test results demonstrate that there is a linear relationship between vertical and lateral stresses for normally loaded cohesionless soils under K0 conditions. K0 values obtained for the loose state of compactness are higher than for the dense state of compactness. The results of the artificial neural network model indicate that the model serves as simple and reliable tool to predict σ h? and also K0 in cohesionless soils. The variation of K0 values with internal friction angles is obtained and a simple expression is derived from this relationship.

An air-injection technique may be a simple, inexpensive method - this leads the saturated soils to the desaturated by injecting pressurized air, resulting in a higher liquefaction strength and lower susceptibility. The objective of this study is to investigate the evolution of desaturation process during air injection into saturated soil deposits and verify the validity of a multiphase flow simulator if it is capable of being applied for predicting the process as well as the distribution of degree of saturation after the air injection ceased. In this study simplified model tests that simulate the air injection into saturated soils using air-injection probes, are conducted using two different sizes of soil containers. The experiments using the small container are aimed to examine the nominal rates and magnitudes of the soil desaturation driven by air injection, whilst those with the large container are performed to obtain not only the rates and magnitudes but also the distributions of the desaturated zones within the soil. The results obtained indicate, although clearly depending on the physical properties of targeted soils, that the evolution of desaturation is strongly controlled by the air pressures injected and the soil permeabilities. Numerical analyses are also conducted using a multiphase flow simulator to describe the evolution of the soil desaturation, and to examine the applicability of the model as a prediction tool enabling an evolution of desaturation in situ to be followed with time and space. Predictions show a relatively good agreement with the experimental measurements regarding the rates, magnitudes, and distribution of desaturation specifically for the small-container experiments although predictions of desaturated domain slightly overestimate the measurements for the large-container experiments. Thus, this study indicates that the numerical model described is applicable to field problems when the soil properties in terms of flow transport are well-constrained.

This paper describes an investigation on the reinforcing effect of soil-root matrix in the laboratory using a modified large shear box apparatus (300 mm x 300 mm). Four different species of plant namely Vertiveria zizanoides, Leucaena leucocephala, Bixa orel-lana and Bauhiniapurpurea were planted in special boxes containing residual soil compacted to a known density. The results show that roots significantly contribute to the increase in soil shear strength. The presence of the roots only affects the apparent cohesion of the soil and no significant change in angle of friction is observed. L. leucocephala shows the outstanding increase in its root strength in which the strength varies with depth and time e.g., under soil suction-free condition (matric suction = 0), the roots have increased the cohesion by 116.6% (0.1 m), 225.0% (0.3 m) and 413.4% (0.5 m) after six months of growth. In twelve months, it is observed that the increase in cohesion is more than three-fold of the six months growth period at 0.1 m depth. The results also indicate that shear strength is influenced by root profile and to some extent, the physiological parameters of the plants. Copyright © 2005-2009 National Institute of Informatics.

The dormitory encountered excessive differential settlement due to the variation in soil profile. Part of the building was underlain by very stiff to hard SUT silty clay and part by loose clayey sand. Underpinning to extend the foundations down to stable stratum was employed to strengthen bearing capacity and minimize settlement. The underpinning design and procedure were summarized. In practice, the static formula was used for the preliminary micro-pile design (selection of pile section and length for different loads and soil profiles). The undrained shear strength (Su) of SUT silty clay was approximated using the Stress History and Normalized Soil Engineering Properties (SHANSEP) technique and standard penetration number (N). The finite element method was employed to predict the load-settlement curve of the micro-pile. Modified cam clay model was proved as a suitable model for this prediction. The measured settlements of the underpinned foundations after one year service were less than 0.5 mm. This small settlement guarantees the stability of the underpinned structure. It is also found that the settlement ratio (ratio of the measured settlement of underpinned foundations to the predicted settlement of single micro-pile) varied from 0.7 to 3.0.

Uzuoka R., Sento N., Kazama M	Seepage and inertia effect on rate-dependent reaction of a pile in liquefied soil	2008	Soils and Foundations	48	1		15	25		5	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-70849085513&partnerID=40&md5=5b936c082e07339052db1da27cd5a065	Tohoku University, Japan	Uzuoka, R., Tohoku University, Japan; Sento, N., Tohoku University, Japan; Kazama, M, Tohoku University, Japan	The seepage and inertia effects on the rate-dependent subgrade reaction of a single pile in liquefied soil are clarified through numerical studies. The quasi-static (for seepage effect) and dynamic (for inertia effect) numerical analyses are performed with a soil-water coupled formulation and a simplified cyclic elasto-plastic constitutive model for liquefied sand. The constitutive model can explicitly deal with the liquefaction intensity by changing the lower bounds of the mean effective stress. The liquefied soil at a certain depth around a pile is modeled with finite elements under a plane stress condition. The results of the quasi-static analyses under monotonic loading conditions show that the apparent rate-dependency of the subgrade reaction is caused by the seepage of pore water around the pile due to soil positive dilatancy under large strain range. The results of the dynamic analyses under cyclic loading conditions show that the positive correlation in ap-v (subgrade reaction-pile relative velocity) relation can be explained with the phase difference in movement between a pile and the neighboring soil around the pile due to inertia under small strain range.

Kohgo Y.	A hysteresis model of soil water retention curves based on bounding surface concept	2008	Soils and Foundations	48	5		633	640		11	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-72449208541&partnerID=40&md5=c8ce2b8beba8bff26570a295cd2bdb1f	Graduate School of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan	Kohgo, Y., Graduate School of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan	This paper presents a hysteresis model of soil water retention curves based on bounding surface concept. In the bounding surface concept, the plastic modulus is defined as a function of the distance between a current stress point and the conjugated stress point on the bounding surface. We adopt the similar idea that the slopes c (= -∂Sr/∂s) of soil water retention curves are defined as a function of the normalized distance between a current point and the conjugated points on main curves (main drying and wetting curves). The modeling of main curves was conducted by Tangential model proposed by the author. Tangential model insures the continuity of slopes of soil water retention curves. The model may well trace the soil water retention curves as if pore water pressures are both positive and negative. The model needs not to identify the parameters. Only three points are selected and the values of degree of saturation Sr, suction s and slope c at the points are input. Soil water retention curves for three samples with cycles of drying and wetting were simulated using the model. The simulation results showed good agreements with the experimental ones.

Formulation of Gmax from reconstituted clayey soils and its application to Gmax measured in the field	2008	Soils and Foundations	48	6		821	831		3	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-72749098642&partnerID=40&md5=f157b35f69d571c682f5928a46cd6367	Department of Civil Engineering, Hakodate National College of Technology, Japan; Division of Solid waste, Graduate School of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Japan	Kawaguchi, T., Department of Civil Engineering, Hakodate National College of Technology, Japan; Tanaka, H., Division of Solid waste, Graduate School of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Japan	The elastic shear modulus of natural sedimentary clay ground, G max, is estimated based on laboratory tests for fifteen different reconstituted clays. Two types of tests were performed, i.e., Bender Element and Cyclic Triaxial tests. The proposed formulation is not based on void ratio, e, but consists of only three parameters: WL (liquid limit), p' (the current mean effective stress) and pḿax (the maximum mean consolidation pressure). To apply it to the field, this equation is modified for using σv?o (the in situ effective overburden pressure) and OCR, instead of p' and P'max. Since existing formulae for Gmax are mostly based on e, they are not able to apply to both reconstituted soil and field, without considering the correction factor for structure. This is because e in the field is much larger than that for reconstituted soil even though their consolidation pressures and OCR are the same for these clays. The applicability of the proposed formula was examined by using investigated results from the in-situ seismic surveys performed at eleven worldwide sites. It is well demonstrated that the proposed equation in this paper is capable of predicting G max of natural sedimentary clay deposits with higher accuracy than the existing empirical formulae using a function of e.

The particulate nature of soil results in highly complex, non-linear response characteristics, and developing models that can capture soil response under cyclic loading is non-trivial. The distinct element method (DEM) can be used to study the fundamental, particle-scale mechanics of granular materials, and offers much promise as a tool to advance understanding of soil response. The first stage in adopting DEM to model cyclic soil response is to quantitatively demonstrate that a DEM model can replicate physical test data, as analytical vali-dation of DEM models for random assemblies of particles under repeated loading is not viable. This paper describes a series of strain-controlled cyclic triaxial tests on an ideal granular material (steel spheres) that were used to validate the capability of an axi-symmetric DEM model to analyse cyclic loading. The DEM model was then used in a parametric study to examine the particle-scale mechanics of the response of specimens of uniform spheres to 50 cycles of loading with various strain amplitudes. The distribution of contact force orientations and magnitudes during testing was exam-ined. The simulations indicate that both the fabric anisotropy and coordination number continued to evolve over the 50 cycles considered. While the variation in the macro-scale response was less marked, there is a clear relation between the micro-scale parameters and the overall specimen response.

Soil-water coupled finite deformation analysis based on a rate-type equation of motion incorporating the SYS Cam-clay model	2008	Soils and Foundations	48	6		771	790		17	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-72749086159&partnerID=40&md5=58c027cd12b0b3944f16250c6eab3ede	Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya University, Japan	Noda, T., Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya University, Japan; Asaoka, A., Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya University, Japan; Nakano, M., Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya University, Japan	This paper presents a new method of soil-water coupled finite deformation analysis of saturated soils that considers inertial forces. This method allows changes in the geometric shape of the soil to be taken into account and is capable of dealing with all types of external forces irrespective of whether they are static or dynamic. To be more specific, the paper describes the following points, which differ from the conventional methods: I) the governing equations for saturated soil including the rate-type equation of motion containing a jerk term of the soil skeleton conforming to u-p formulation and updated Lagrangian, 2) derivation of a weak form of the rate-type equation of motion and discretization of the finite elements, and 3) use of the implicit time integration method for application of the conventional linear acceleration method (which assumes linear variation of acceleration) to the jerk term. By mounting the elasto-plastic constitutive equation (SYS Cam-clay model), which can cover a wide range of soils and soil conditions, onto the above method of analysis, examples of simulation of dynamic/static triaxial laboratory testing of saturated soil specimens are described. The soil specimens were assumed to be medium dense sand under conditions of small-amplitude cyclic loading, partial drainage, and constant cell pressure. The simulation yielded the following results: (I) In the case of low frequencies, compaction occurs during loading and compression progresses over the entire specimen. (2) In the case of high frequencies, during loading and in the period in which wave propagation continues within the specimen after the end of loading, compaction occurs at the drained end of the specimen, whereas liquefaction occurs in its interior. After this stage, massive compression takes place within the specimen, leading to consolidation (consolidation after liquefaction).

From observed liquefaction characteristics, clayey sands with different clay contents can be grouped as sand-like or clay-like soils depending on the clay content and the transitional fines content of the sand-clay mixture. A simple equation is derived and verified to correlate the transitional fines content with the void ratios of the clean sand and the pure clay consisting of the mixture. In addition, a new relationship for clay content correction is proposed based on the linear relationship between the cyclic resistance ratio and the clay content at the same intergranular void ratio. The cyclic resistance ratio of sand-like clayey sands can be divided into two components: (1) the resistance of the sand skeleton at the specific intergranular void ratio, and (2) the increment of cyclic resistance from clayey fines. The rate of increment for cyclic resistance varies with the properties of contained clay particles. Data from three independent studies have shown the proposed procedure is promising.

Strength and deformation characteristics of scoria in triaxial compression at low confining stress	2008	Soils and Foundations	48	1		27	39		2	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-70849119209&partnerID=40&md5=07dc13e78e1bcac69e7717fe9e2b45d6	Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Yamanashi, Japan	Agustian, Y., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Yamanashi, Japan; Goto, S., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Yamanashi, Japan	Scoria deposit can be found around many volcanoes of the Quarternary epoch in the world. In Japan, Mount Fuji is one of volcanoes, where surface area is widely layered by scoria. From a geotechnical engineering point of view, scoria has many problems because of its physical characteristics by means of its collapsible properties. Since scoria is a non-cohesive material, it is vulnerable to water-induced change and fails easily due to rainfall or snow melting. These are the primary causes of debris flow which frequently occurs in the Mount Fuji area. Typically, this type of debris flow is called  Yukishiro in Japanese. For better understanding of the shear behavior of scoria within low stress level condition, drained triaxial compression tests were performed on loose dry scoria under low confining pressures (10-80 kPa) which are assumed as representative of the field surface stress conditions. The effects of grain size, dry density Pd and effective confining stress σ'c upon stress-strain behaviour and angle of internal friction φd were investigated. Attention was also paid to level of grain breakage Bg and reproducibility of the test. Grain breakage investigations were carried out on the particle breakage phenomenon, which occurs during testing. Additionally, initial Young's modulus of scoria was identified. As a result, reproducibility of the test is good in terms of stress-strain curves, however volumetric strain versus axial strain exhibits less reproducibility than stress-strain curves. At stress level of 10-80 kPa, it was found that the dependency of φd on σ'c is almost negligible, while there is noticeable dependency of φd on grain size. The effect of grain size on stress-strain relationships was observed. It was also found that grain breakage was noticed at stress level of 10 ∼ 80 kPa, which describes the dependency scoria parameters on confining stress and the effect of grain size upon Bg-σ' crelationships was also observed.

Under various stress stages imposing under triaxial condition, the deviator stress had an indiscernible influence on the elastic shear modulus. The path of vertically logged elastic shear modulus of clay could reasonably be expressed in terms of mean effective stress. Two pairs of bender elements were installed in the square oedometer so that shear wave velocities of samples which were trimmed parallel or perpendicular to their bedding direction can be measured in the vertical and horizontal directions. For sample trimmed parallel to the bedding direction (conventional one), the horizontal shear wave velocity was larger than the vertical one. The opposite observation, however, was observed for sample trimmed 90 degrees apart. The extents of different in vertically and horizontally logged shear wave velocities from both types of samples were almost similar. This clearly indicated the influence of inherent anisotropy rather than the stress induced. The mean effective stress can well represent the stage variable of elastic shear modulus.

The experimental parameters were the difference in loading methods (i.e., dynamic and static), input seismic motions (i.e., intensity and number of cycles), soil densities (i.e., dense and medium dense), and the ratio of horizontal and overturning moment loads. The experimental data set contains the accelerations and displacements of the soil and foundation as well as the distributions of normal and shear reaction forces at the foundation base. The experimental results provide crucial data to model the coupling effect among vertical, horizontal, and overturning loads, the accumulation of irreversible displacement, and the foundation uplift, and so is one of the most complete benchmark data sets for the development and validation of numerical models for the nonlinear response of shallow foundations to strong earthquakes.

A series of undrained torsional shear tests with constant a and b-values were conducted by hollow cylindrical torsional shear (HCTS) apparatus on Firoozkuh sand containing a wide range of silt percentage. The dry deposition method was selected in the tests. The principal stress direction or inclination angle with respect to the depositional (vertical) direction has a considerable effect on the response of sand that is related to inherent anisotropy in sand fabric during sedimentation. In addition, adding different amount of silt to the host sand causes dramatic strain softening response in the behaviour even at high relative densities, whereby silty sands present higher tendency to flow compared to pure sands. The results show that adding silt to sand skeleton decreases the anisotropy effect up to a certain silt content and then it starts to increase. This phenomenon is attributed to the mixture's unstable structure. Sand-silt-sand contacts cause the meta-stable and unstable fabric. Flow potential increases by increasing the silt content till thirty per-cent and it has a direct relation with inclination angle a. Also, brittleness index is influenced much more by silt content at thirty percent compared to inclination angle. Copyright © 2005-2009 National Institute of Informatics.

Previous work, however, has shown that the maximum interior temperature of field test bodies reaches to about 90°C. On the other hand, industrial waste disposal is an increasing problem. PET (polyethylene terephthalate) waste is now generated in vast quantities to increased consumption of drinking water sold in PET bottles. Making effective use of PET waste as a ground material may help solve the problem of its disposal. This paper describes the effects of initial high temperature curing on unconfined compressive strength and the microstructure of foamed mixture lightweight soil containing PET flake. Increase in PET-cement ratio lessened the decrease in unconfined compressive strength with increasing initial temperature. This property makes PET flake useful as a construction material. However, unconfined compressive strength decreases with increasing initial temperature at all PET-cement ratios. Observations show that the microstructure of foamed mixture lightweight soil containing PET flake have noticeable cracks if samples are cured at 90°C for 1 day; the PET flake is not completely combined with the matrix. The formation of this microstructure is the main factor of the remarkable strength decrease based on initial high temperature curing.

A series of laboratory tests was carried out in order to obtain the cyclic shear characteristics of scoria. Undrained cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on reconstituted scoria deposits obtained from Mt. Fuji, Yamanashi Prefecture. To evaluate the degree of particle breakage due to shearing, the grain size distribution has been evaluated before and after cyclic triaxial tests by traditional techniques. The differences in liquefaction characteristics between Scoria and other materials from previous studies were demonstrated. From the results of undrained cyclic triaxial test on the scoria, it was understood that the effect of relative density Dr on the cyclic shear strength of scoria material is small, in the range 43.8% to 97.7% of Dr. Comparison results between monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests on grain breakage due to shearing shows that the degree of grain breakage for cyclic triaxial test is relatively higher than from monotonic tests for a similar dry density.

Mobilisation of earth pressure acting on pile caps under cyclic loading	2008	Soils and Foundations	48	6		741	754			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-72749084861&partnerID=40&md5=94f529a5b87bbea01c2d71c3527f0d34	Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan; Public Works Research Institute, Japan	Takahashi, A., Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan; Sugita, H., Public Works Research Institute, Japan; Tanimoto, S., Public Works Research Institute, Japan	In lateral resistance of piles with a pile cap, marked contribution of the pile cap resistance can be expected. For seismic performance assessment of pile foundations, mobilisation of the earth pressure acting on pile caps, induced by interactions between the pile cap and surrounding soils, has to be properly considered. In this study, a series of centrifuge model tests were conducted (1) to examine the effect of strain history on the mobilization of lateral earth pressure acting on pile caps and (2) to show the importance of considering strain history when modelling the interaction between a surface soil layer and a pile cap. Observations into the physical model tests reveal that mobilisation of the earth pressure acting on pile caps under cyclic loading can drastically change depending on soil type and/or conditions. Especially, relocation of soil adjacent to the pile cap in unload-reload phase plays an important role for the earth pressure mobilisation, as it completely alters the shape of the earth pressure-displacement curves. Based on the physical model test results, a simple empirical model that can be used for the beam on non-linear Winkler foundation type analysis is proposed and compared to the test results.

Firstly, the constant pressurize rate tests were carried out for the material having various specifications. Secondly, the cyclic pressurize test was carried out to examine the self-sealing function as a buffer material. Thirdly, the constant pressure test was carried out to observe the change in strength during seepage. The observed phenomena were analytically examined. As a result, it was found that the strength for hydraulic fracturing of the buffer material increased with the increase of initial dry density, decrease of sand-mixture ratio and decrease of water content. The swelling pressure of the buffer material worked as a constraint stress for the strength for hydraulic fracturing. The fracture made by hydraulic fracturing was fixed through the supply of water. However a long period of low-pressure supply was needed to recover the strength at the failed parts. While the tensile failure was dominant, the specimen having a low dry density might be failed initially by the shear failure. When the water content became large during seepage, the strength for hydraulic fracturing reduced. Copyright © 2005-2009 National Institute of Informatics.

The pile-group was embedded in dry sand and subjected to sinusoidal waves and an earthquake motion recorded from the 1995 Hyo-go-ken Nanbu (Kobe) earthquake. The load transfer between soil and pile was derived and the group effect was captured. Numerical simulations were also performed using a Beam-on-Nonlinear-Winkler-Foundation approach with a new hystereticp-y curve. A comparison of the experimental and numerical results revealed that the numerical simulation is capable of accounting for the soil-pile interaction observed in the experiment.

Khan M.R.A., Hayano K., Kitazume M.	Investigation on static stability of sheet pile quay wall improved by cement treated sea-side ground from centrifuge model tests	2008	Soils and Foundations	48	4		563	575		2	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-70849083488&partnerID=40&md5=a45cc9c1a7a00f91cc64316462fa059a	Yokohama National University, Japan; Port and Airport Research Institute, Geotechnical and Structural Engineering Department, Japan	Khan, M.R.A.; Hayano, K., Yokohama National University, Japan; Kitazume, M., Port and Airport Research Institute, Geotechnical and Structural Engineering Department, Japan	The static stability of sheet pile quay walls on a thick clay deposit against horizontal loads was studied through a series of centrifuge model tests. In the tests, an overconsolidated Kaolin clay layer was prepared over a layer of dense Toyoura sand in a rectangular container. The model quay wall was set to the bottom of the sand layer. The sea-side area adjacent to the quay wall was improved with cement-treated Kawasaki clay. Under 50 g centrifugal acceleration, the clay deposit was consolidated and horizontal line loads of about 0 to 70 kN/m were applied to the quay wall. The width and the depth of the improved area were varied and its performance was compared with that of a quay wall em-bedded in unimproved ground. Results of the study indicated that the improved ground provided significant resistance against horizontal loading. In addition, a numerical model to estimate the mechanical behavior of the sheet pile quay wall is presented. The outcomes of the numerical model show good agreement with the centrifuge test results.

Huang C.-C., Kang W.-W.	Seismic bearing capacity of a rigid footing adjacent to a cohesionless slope	2008	Soils and Foundations	48	5		641	651		1	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-72449159637&partnerID=40&md5=08f3ea6db855df09e6e169dbb88413fb	Department of Civil Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan	Huang, C.-C., Department of Civil Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Kang, W.-W., Department of Civil Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan	At present, analytical or empirical formula for seismic bearing capacity of footings adjacent to slopes is not available. This study uses a pseudo-static-based approach in conjunction with rigorous Janbu's slice method to derive analytical values of seismic bearing capacity factors (N y) and correction factors for the effects of inertia of soil mass and load inclinations for a rigid footing adjacent to cohesionless slopes. It is shown that both the bearing capacity factors (Ny) and the correction factors for the seismic bearing capacity of footings placed on level ground derived herein are comparable with those reported in the literature. Empirical equations regarding the effects of slope angles and load in-clinations, expressed using generalized forms of those proposed in the literature, are also derived. It is also found that the empirical equations derived in the present study provide values of correction factors in good agreements with the analytical ones, indicating the validity of using these empirical equations for assessing the bearing capacity of rigid footings situated on the slope subjected to pseudo-static seismic loading.
