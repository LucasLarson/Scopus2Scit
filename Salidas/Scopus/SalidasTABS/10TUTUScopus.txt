Charles Pearson envisioned a plan that involved construction of a huge central station for the London City with underground railways connecting the main-line termini that were developing at the edge of the city. reformer. He wanted to make it easier for the poor of London to move out of their slums and travel easily and cheaply into London from new towns planned for locations such as Hornsey or Tottenham. The 1854-5 Commons Select Committee on Metropolitan Communications took a favorable view of Pearson's arguments and recommended the construction of an underground railway to connect the various termini with a central station at Farringdon. compensation. Financial backing for the Metropolitan Railway Company was slow to materialize. While the Great Western Railway was prepared to invest GBP 175,000 the Great Northern was more reluctant.		railway construction; railway transport; tunnel; underground construction; urban planning; England; London [England]; United Kingdom						Wolmar, C., The Subterranean Railway, , Atlantic Books; Bownes, D., Green, O., Mullins, S., Underground.

TBMs were chosen for the twin drives of the 4.6km-long legacy tunnel in the Queensland capital of Brisbane. Not only are hard rock machines well suited to the sound igneous rock underneath the houses of the well-off western suburbs, but also because there were machines available in the city. The TBMs also happen to be the right size and capacity. Like the Clem 7, which opened in 2009, the Legacy tunnel will be a twin, two-lane motorway, running beneath and into the central part of the city, which has been growing more and more congested. The first, Clem 7, tunnel runs from the southern suburbs underneath the Brisbane river, and the new tunnel will bring in traffic from the west. The Transapex project, as it is called, has so far seen the building of the Clem 7 and the Y-shaped Airport Link into the northern suburbs and as the name suggests to the airport near the coast.		drilling; project assessment; suburban area; TBM; tunnel design; tunneling; Australia; Brisbane; Queensland							Greeman, A.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The article discusses the need for improving underground infrastructure in London in light of the population that is projected to rise from 7.6 million in 2007 to around 10 million by 2030. The number of jobs in the city is projected to rise by approaching 20 per cent in the same period. The London Underground is the busiest it has ever been. In recent years annual passenger journey numbers have risen steadily reaching over 1.2bn in the 2012/2013 year. On a typical week day over 4M individual journeys are made. On Tuesday August 7, 2012 during the London Olympic Games a record peak of 4.57 million passengers used the Tube. Looking ahead current projections suggest annual journeys will reach 1.5bn by 2020. LU has committed to a program of line and station upgrades. The line upgrades deliver new signaling systems and in many cases also new trains, to increase capacity by pushing more trains through the existing infrastructure.		future prospect; infrastructural development; infrastructure planning; railway transport; transportation planning; travel behavior; England; London [England]; United Kingdom															0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The London Underground was poised for growth at the start of the First World War in 1914. All but the Metropolitan were incorporated in the Underground Electric Railway Limited, which had been formed by the American tycoon, Charles Tyson Yerkes. The most serious danger in the First World War in London was bombing either by Zeppelins or planes. There were complaints about this as they interfered with the passengers. As the Underground was perceived as safer and with the additional numbers due to many troops moving around the capital, the use of the system increased dramatically during the war. People became more accustomed to using the underground. Eventually, it was decided that trains should proceed slowly during raids. The impact of the Second World Warfrom 1939 to 1945 on the London Underground was much more profound and dramatic. The war was not unexpected and plans for the emergency were made as early as 1937.		historical geography; metropolitan area; perception; railway transport; transportation history; transportation system; urban transport; war; England; London [England]; United Kingdom						Wolmar, C., The Subterranean Railway.

London underground 1963-2013 funding gap	2013	Tunnels and Tunnelling International		SEP		33	36			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84884230948&partnerID=40&md5=2c2c0b0786f0c564ffc2087411b508d8		Conacher, A.	The article discusses how underground infrastructure faced neglect and underinvestment during 1963 and 2013. With the nationalization of Land Transport in 1948 it became a part of the behemoth that was the British Transport Commission (BTC). It was a period of state control of services, but this was an interesting step as it effectively renationalised a public sector entity. The Treasury effectively controlled the BTC. With a nation crying out for improvements to health, a need for electricity and major new house building projects; London's infrastructure needs were perhaps a secondary concern. BTC was abolished in 1963 in favor of direct ministerial control of the network. However, this didn't benefit the budget. Records show GBP 1.1M available for improvements annually. In 1970, LT became part of the iocai government body, Greater London Council (GLC). However, since the New Works Program of the 1930s, the Underground had languished through three decades of neglect.		infrastructural development; investment location; local government; project management; railway transport; transportation history; transportation infrastructure; transportation planning; England; London [England]; United Kingdom						Bownes, D., (2012) Underground: How the Tube Shaped London; Brux, S., (1996) London's Jubilee Line Extension; Gaffney, D., (2000) Funding London Underground: Financial Myths and Economic Realities; (2002) World Best Metro Practice - Meilleur Metro Mondiale: Papers from a Conference at the ICE, , ICE Transport Board, London; (1994) Jubilee Line Extension: NATM Particular Specification, , London Underground Ltd; Mitchell, B., (2003) Jubilee Line Extension: Concept to Eompletion; (1995) Jubilee Line Extension Project: Archaeological Excavations in Westminster, , Museum of London Archaeology Service; (2004) London Underground PPP: Were They Good deals?, , National Audit Office; Jubilee Line Extension: NCE Supplements, Feb. 1994, Sep. 1996 and Oct. 1999, pp. 94-99. , NCE; (1990) 2nd Report: LU's Financial Deficit, , Parliament: Commons Transport Committee; (1991) London Underground (Victoria) Act 1991, , Parliament; Powell, K., (2000) The Jubilee Line Extension; Schabas, M., (1994) Burnt Offering: Jubilee Line Extension; Times, T., (1985) Going Ahead on the Victoria Line: Special Report on the ICE	Conacher, A.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The article discusses making road tunnel environments safe through effective filtration. The original tunnels built were done so for the task of overcoming geological problems namely rivers and mountains. Now they are also used to overcome manmade obstacles, cities. The vehicular traffic has increased to such a degree that to travel through a city by car takes as long in the 21st century as it did in the 19th century. The energy requirement increases so when the fan is sized for the system the fan must be able to still collect dust when the bag is full and requires changing. Electrostatic precipitators have changed over the years. The original precipitators had wires in the ionizing section to generate the corona discharge which is necessary for the precipitator to work. The problem with using wires was that they could break due to the high voltage vibrating the wires and electro-discharge machining.		safety; tunnel design; tunneling; underground construction							Gale, R.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The drilling units actually driving the tunnel are two Sandvik DD320-40 twin boom drill rigs mounting HLX5 drifters. One drills from the south end of the tunnel and the other from the north. These drive the 10m high by 12.3m wide tunnel by first drilling and blasting a top heading, leaving a 3.5m bench which is then mined out after the top heading is mucked out. A design advance rate of 4m per round was given, though realized rate has been 3.75m on average. Mucking out is with a Cat 966 wheel loader tipping into contractor-owned 30t on highway trucks. The muck is delivered to stockpiles near the site which may be used for road stone by the Turkish Roads Authority. The current schedule calls for one 4m round to be drilled, blasted and mucked out per shift, with two working shifts per day.		blasting; drilling; tunnel design; tunneling; underground construction; Turkey							Williams, L.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The Branisko tunnel is a 5km long road tunnel with bidirectional traffic in Eastern Slovakia, which was opened in 2003. An escape tunnel is situated parallel to the road tunnel. The tunnel is equipped with a semi transversal ventilation system with smoke extraction dampers, which was designed in the 1990s. The first test was a success. Although the smoke extraction capacity was not sufficient, due to high duct leakages, the fire ventilation system was able to limit the spread of smoke and finally to remove the fumes from the tunnel. However, the safety issue is more complicated in tunnels with bidirectional traffic or in unidirectional city tunnels, where congestions are supposed to happen and people may be trapped on both sides of the fire location.		safety; tunnel design; tunneling; ventilation; Slovakia							Pospisil, P.; Tunnelventilation.proSwitzerland								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Qatar is preparing to set new records in tunneling with 26 TBMs simultaneously boring 59km of twin bore tunnels creating the first phase of the vital Doha Metro. The metro project is a key element of the Qatar Rail Development Program, which also includes a 400km heavy rail link that will connect the country with the wider GCC railway, and a 38km light rail network around Lusail City to the north of Doha. After a huge international procurement program that saw Qatar Railways present its scheme all over the world, the first major design and build tunneling contracts were awarded in late May 2013. Qatari companies are included in all of the consortia, which was a requirement from early bidding stages. The second contract is for the southern section of the red line running from Doha south to the Sheikh Hamad international Airport. it is slightly longer that the northern section with 13.8km of twin bore, and also includes a 1.2km single operational link.		railway transport; transportation development; transportation planning; tunnel design; tunneling; Doha; Qatar							Ballantyne, B.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

It is all for the new Eglinton Scarborough Crosstown LRT (ECLRT), a cornerstone of the City of Toronto's transit infrastructure upgrade. Contract ECLM6-2 Supply of Precast Concrete Tunnel Lining Segments was released for bid to prequalified companies in late 2010. The manufacture of the tunnel lining segments was not part of the tunneling contract. Tunnel segment manufacturing was a single contract. Metrolinx chose to put the manufacturing in the hands of actual manufacturers in a complete reversal of the traditional approach. Historically in this business, tenders were released for contractors to bore the tunnel and supply the tunnel liners. So now, gone are the days of contractors having molds made and partnering with precasters or establishing a temporary facility to make the liners.		development project; infrastructural development; railway construction; tunnel design; tunnel lining; tunneling; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto							Erskine, T.; Lvely School of BusinessUnited States								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Sweden and Finland are planning to bury high-level nuclear waste in an underground area around the early 2020s. The elected site in Sweden is at Forsmark, north east of Stockholm, and it had to compete for the right to be the candidate site. After years of site investigation, the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co filed an application for the license to construct and operate the high level waste vault in 2011. Site investigation data had revealed stresses in the granitic rock mass, which is part of the Fennoscandian Shield, to be less than expected; the stress profile did not rise with depth as quickly as had been estimated. Less stress meant more opportunity to excavate, and at deeper depths, to create storage vaults without detrimental stress release and negative effects on the quality of the rock mass. The result was that a vault could be located about 470m below the surface at Forsmark, or almost the same depth Oskarshamn.		radioactive waste; rock mass response; site investigation; stress analysis; underground construction; underground storage; waste disposal; Baltic Shield; East European Craton; Finland; Forsmark; Kalmar [Sweden]; Oskarshamn; Stockholm [Sweden]; Sweden; Uppsala [Sweden]							Reynolds, P.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Tunnel fires can generate large quantities of very hot smoke. This smoke is thermally buoyant and tends to accumulate in a hot layer immediately below the soffit of the tunnel. In the UK, as in many other European countries, it has become standard practice to include the installation of passive fire protection as a part of the design considerations for a tunnel refurbishment. The application of passive fire protection serves to thermally insulate the structure of the tunnel from the effects of a fire, thereby protect it from fire damage. The application of thermal insulation does not, of course, reduce the amount of heat energy emitted by the fire. It simply prevents that heat energy from being absorbed. A good starting point to start to look at potential fire damage is to examine in more detail the structure of tunnel cables.		fire management; insulation; temperature effect; tunnel design; tunneling; United Kingdom							Evans, A.; Aegis Tunnel ConsultingUnited Kingdom								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The first tunnel fire suppression systems in the UK were commissioned in the New Tyne Crossing in 2011, and the installation of high-pressure mist systems is currently ongoing in the Dartford Tunnels between Kent and Essex. Other tunnels in the UK are actively considering such fire suppression systems. However, tunnel operators are certainly justified in asking what the benefits of fire suppression are, and whether their price tag can really be justified. Suppression systems have the potential of reducing the intensity of any fires, so as to reduce the extent of any damage to the tunnel structure and equipment, and also serve to protect tunnel users from the effects of fire.		fire management; installation; risk assessment; safety; tunnel design; England; Essex [England]; Kent; United Kingdom							Tarada, F.; PIARCUnited States								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The continuous increase in demand for better and more sustainable travel facilities in major cities has led to a significant increase in the interest in routing roads, railways and metros through tunnels. Due to the abundance of existing underground infrastructure at deeper depths, tunnels in urban areas are often being constructed at shallow depths. Bottom-up construction involves the excavation of a trench in which the tunnel is erected. Temporary structures, such as sheet pile walls, secant pile walls, tangent pile walls or sheet pile walls are usually required and installed before the excavation takes place to support it. Providing unreinforced side slopes may require the removal of up to six times more material, and spread an additional three tunnel diameters on either side of the excavation for tunnels with depth of cover equal to its diameter.		sheet piled wall; stiffness; stress; tunnel lining							University of New BrunswickCanada								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The primary objective of all tunneling works at TCRSU was to minimize ground movements. To this extent reducing excavated area, speed to tunnel ring closure and controlled tunnel advances were critical. The primary ground support for the main tunnels is steel fiber reinforced sprayed concrete with a spray applied waterproof membrane located at the boundary between the primary and secondary linings. The installation of the steel frames was made significantly easier because they were carried out within the temporary SCL shell. Removal of the crown segments of the platform tunnels required a full line closure and each was carried out during a 52 hour weekend possession. To ensure speed of installation, steel I-beams were half cast in concrete so they could be lowered into place and act as permanent formwork for the overbridge floor slab.		bridge construction; ground movement; reinforced concrete; tunnel lining; tunneling						(2006) Guideline Sprayed Concrete, , ÖvBB, August; (1996) European Specification for Sprayed Concrete, , EFNARC	London OfficesUnited Kingdom								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Technical journalist Adrian Greeman asks some of its engineers to recall their engineering achievements and innovations for Brisbane's Airport Link tunnel in Australia. Some 1,700 engineers and designers in total and, at peak, some 3,500 constructors from site workers to miners, supervisors, managers and directors, created in under four years a major underground freeway just more than 6.7-km long from a busy city center and passing beneath continuous built-up residential suburbs. It is one of Australia's and indeed the world's biggest road tunnels speeding traffic from the city center and the south, to the airport area, situated close to the Pacific coast on the north side of the Brisbane river estuary. To create the project, the design build partnership of joint venture consultants Parsons Brinckerhoff and Arup, and the contractors Thiess and John Holland have essentially had to carry through two giant tunnel projects, one by TBM and one by rock excavation.

A dramatically increasing amount of traffic in the city of Stockholm in the mid-2Oth century led to a plan for a ring road around Stockholm?s inner city, to relieve the center from most traffic. A new concept for the tunnel inner lining structure has been utilized on this project which comprises the use of precast elements, a suspended shell structure and also a sprayed concrete lining. The primary function of the inner lining is to protect the traffic against ice, dripping water, fire and the force. The tunnels are located within the Stockholm granite and granite gneiss which is characterized by vertical dipping joints! fissures and horizontal layering.		drill and blast; gneiss; granite; road transport; tunnel design; tunnel lining; underground construction; Stockholm [Sweden]; Sweden							Hochtief Solutions, Norra LaenkenSweden								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Round-lining interaction control is one of the most critical processes during a tunneling project's implementation. Some of the design and construction decisions during a tunnel project are very critical to reduce the ground movements around the excavated tunnel. Tunnel linings are structural systems, but differ from other structural systems in their interaction with the surrounding ground, which is an integral aspect of their behavior, stability and overall load carrying capacity. The loss or lack of support provided by the surrounding ground can lead to a failure of the lining. The tunnel lining deformation allows the moments in the tunnel lining to redistribute the main load inside the lining which are axial or eccentric load. The most efficient tunnel lining is one that has high flexibility and ductility.		deformation; ductility; ground movement; innovation; tunnel design; tunnel lining; underground construction						Beniawski, Z.T., (1984) Rock Mechanics Design in Mining and Tunneling, , Balkema; Barton, N.R., Lunde, J., Engineering classification of rack masses for the design of tunnel support (1974) International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Science & Geomech, , Abst.25, No. 13-13; Bringiotti, M., (2003) Guida Al Tunnelling: l'Evoluzione e la Sfida, pp. 403-406. , 2nd Edition, Parma; Design of composite steel and concrete structures (2004) General Rules and Rules for Buildings, , Eurocode 4, EN 1994-1-1; Hock, E., Bray, J.W., (1981) Rock Slope Engineering, , Institution of Mining and Metallugy, London; Lunardi, P., Froldi, P., Fornari, E., Rockmechanics investigations for rock slope stabiiity assessment (1994) International Journal of Rock Mechanics, 31 (4), pp. 323-346; Lunardi, P., (2008) Design and Construction of Tunnels, Analysis of Controlled Deformations in Rack and Soils (ADECO-RS), p. 576. , Springer, Belin; (2008) Nuove Norme Tecniche per le Costruzion, , NTC 2008 - i - DM 14 gennalo; Zenti, C.L., Lunardi, G., Rossi, B., Gallovich, A., A new approach in the design of first lining steel rib (2012) Proc.

Due to hardware requirements, creating a large model covering all new tunnels in a single 3D-FE model was not feasible. The water table stands 6-m below ground surface. The majority of the SCL tunnels are located within the London Clay stratum with a very low permeability. Therefore undrained soil parameters are considered for the analysis of tunnel excavation stages and the primary lining installation. The primary lining is designed only to carry temporary loads and the final lining to sustain the probable long term loads, assuming that the primary lining deteriorates in time. Prior to activating the secondary lining in the model, the primary lining becomes sacrificial by setting its stiffness to one per cent of the original value, hence the loads undertaken by primary lining become negligible and the loads are transferred to the secondary lining.		excavation; London Clay; permeability; stiffness; three-dimensional modeling; tunnel lining; tunneling; water table						(2008) Design of Concrete Structures - Part 1-1: General Rules and Rules for Buildings, , British Standard, Eurocode 2, BS EN 19921-1:2004; (2010) ABAQUS Analysis User's Manual, Version 6.10-EF, , Dassault Systemes Simulia; (2010) German Guideline for Steel Fibre Concrete, Deutscher Ausschuss fur Stahlbeton, , DAfStb-Richtlinie Stahifaserbeton, March; Feiersinger, A., Mitsch, T., (2010) Tunnelling Journal, , Deformation comparison at Green Park, issue December/January 2011; (2011) Bond Street Station Upgrade Project, Final Geotechnical Interpretative Report (GIR), , London Underground, ATK-C125-8799-TUN-R-30109, Rev. 3, April; (2007) Standard, Civil Engineering - Deep Tube Tunnels and Shafts, , London Underground, 1-055, October; (2008) Österreichische Vereinigung für Beton- Und Bautechnik, , Richtlinie Faserbeton, Austrian Guideline for steel fibre concrete, July edition; (2006) Determination of Energy Absorption Capacity of Fibre Reinforced Slab Specimens, , Testing sprayed concrete, BS EN 14488-5	Dr. Sauer and Partners' London office, Crossrail and LUUnited Kingdom								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The change of political system, and therefore the possibility of importing modern technologies, was a turning point in Prague's metro construction. The application of NATM gained pace, and was used for stations, escalators and running tunnels. Contrasting with the earlier projects, the application of precast segmental linings was completely abandoned. For subsequent running tunnels however, this construction was considered not quite suited to the situation. This was often championed by the noted Czech consultant Zdenek Eisenstein. The trench for the first tube was dug in the riverbed, the trench for the second one was dug after complete placement of the first tube.

As a summary, the following points are recommended: ■ Even the most sophisitcated numerical model is incapable of giving an exact answer. Numerical models do have limitations, and peril to the project lurks when the results of a model are trusted blindly. However, when the limits of the model are understood, numerical solutions can yield veiy useful information. As with most tasks, we need to know what we know, but we must also know what we don't. ■ Models are but mathematical calculations based on fundamental laws of physics and engineering theories. Engineers should always question and challenge their models up to the point they are able to explain and defend the results based on theory and/or experience. Confidence in the analysis results should arise from agreement with relevant past experience, cross checking with analytical or simplified numerical solutions, and above all common engineering sense. ■ Modelling engineers should know the 'habits' of the software they are using, its pros and cons, and to develop a thorough checklist that simplifies the modelling and moreover the debugging process. Note also, in a poorly constructed model, debugging may take up to 90 per cent of the overall effort. ■ Decisions on the analysis approach need to be aligned with the characteristics of the project team. It is sometimes preferable, depending on the capacities of the parties involved, to use simpler models (e.g. simple constitutive laws) that are better understood and communicated. Numerical models are built in order to support a pre-specified engineer's decision and they should be understood in this context. This, when balanced with the project budget can lead to an efficient analysis campaign.

The bedrock consists mainly of palaeozoic age rocks (mostly ordovic), and also to a lesser extent the rocks of Mesozoic era, as chalk period sediments were encountered during construction of Petriny Station on extension of Metro Line V.A. The bedrock outcrops are rather rare; bedrock is covered by weathered materials and alluvial and fluvial sediments. Geological conditions were sometimes complex, with some incidents of, for example, running sand lenses, which called for lagging of the tunnel face. For example, compared to segments there might be fewer problems arising from joints, settlement, and safety. in the future, the existing extruded lining under the Vitava River will be a good reference point. The extruded lining is, in respect of its watertightness, still in a good condition.		bedrock; ground conditions; metro system; tunnel design; tunnel lining; tunneling; Czech Republic; Prague; Vltava River							Stehlik, E.; Czech Contractor Metrostav, Metrostav's Division FiveCzech Republic								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The article discusses how selecting the most efficient mining machine is crucial to the profitability, and productivity, of the mine, especially when the mining industry is renowned for its low return on investment. On the surface, this could be considered straightforward. Earth movers above ground have no restrictions on their size and, when it comes to choosing bucket capacity payload size and the most fuel-efficient design, there are limitless options. Electric machines tend to be used mainly in mass mining methods such as block and panel caving. The major advantages of electric machines are their running and energy costs which are considerably lower than diesels. Electric machines run at 95 per cent efficiency whereas only 30 per cent of the fuel's energy in a diesel motor is used in loading and tramming operations, with the rest lost as heat.		machinery; mining; mining industry; productivity; profitability							Satterthwaite, J.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The caves, like any tunnel structure, can be subjected to temperature changes, corrosion damage and freeze-thaw cycles which affect the structure's durability. Proper waterproofing prevents the penetration of moisture and chemicals into the concrete and reinforcing components, ultimately protecting the durability and structural integrity of the concrete. When using shotcrete, it is likely that there will be much less uniformity of coverage across a traditional waterproofing membrane, than with other concrete installation methods. The structural bond that must occur between the traditional stick-on waterproofing membrane can be reduced because of overspray from the shotcrete.

URUP, an abbreviation for Ultra Rapid Under-Pass, is a shaftiess shield technology. The TBM is launched and arrives at ground level and drives under shallow cover without ground treatment. URUP was originally intended as a method to bore tunnels passing under roadways or railways in order to technically differentiate Obayashi in the ever more competitive global and domestic tunnelling markets. Obayashi initially carried out an experimental shaftiess tunnel at their research and development institute where a lOOm long bore with cover ranging from 0.65m to 2.2m was constructed using a prototype rectangular shield equipped with an excavation width of 4.8m and height of 2.1 5m. Obayashi confirmed the feasibility of the system by developing a valid lining design under very shallow cover. The TBM reappeared at the starting point after successfully boring under a cover of 1.2m with maximum ground settlement of only 10mm or less. The traffic above the tunnel was uninterrupted throughout the entire duration of tunnel construction work.		cut and cover; ground settlement; TBM; tunnel design; tunnel lining; tunneling							Kanai, M.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Klaus Bonin of Wacker Chemie gives two examples of successful waterproofing in tunnel construction. The first covers water ingress to a mountain mine access tunnel, while the second covers waterproofing for a pressurized water tunnel. Watertightness was achieved by polymer modification. Sprayed concrete is used as the first cover layer in the construction of some tunnels; it generally is not required to perform any other function. Although economic considerations have raised awareness of the value of single-shell tunnel construction, conventional construction methods are generally used. Yet, while the deformation of the mountain subsides with time, and the sprayed concrete layer is disregarded in terms of structural analysis, the inner shell can be calculated accurately, because it is unaffected. The rough sprayed surface of the initial layer suffices to allow for good adhesive bonding between the sprayed concrete layers; the concrete structure can therefore be regarded as monolithic.		concrete structure; construction method; polymer; tunneling; waterproofing						Barth, F., Control of cracking in concrete structures (2001) American Concrete Institute ACI Report, 224, pp. 4-8; Seidel, W.W., Hahn, F., (2009) Werkstofftechnik, p. 309. , ISBN 978-3-446-42064-9, Carl Hanser Verlag, München Page; (2006) English Version of DIN en 1504-3, (PART 3). , Products and systems for the protection and repair of concrete structures - Definitions, requirements, quality control and evaluation of conformity - Structural and non-structural repair; Lukas, W., Rauch, C., Deporta, C.I., (2003) Einschalige Tunnelbauweise., pp. 32-41. , Beton und Zement; Brux, D., Lng, G., (1996) Einschaliger Tunnelausbau Mit Spritzbeto, p. 440447. , Tiefbau, Flüeler, Peter,2004.

The contract involved two bores, 8km-long, 7.7m 1D, 75m below sea level, using four Howden EPBs. The TBM5 incorporated twin track within the gantries, and were considered to have advanced fire-fighting provisions, including two water curtains, AFFF fire suppression systems controlled by a central control panel housed in a non- fireproof container, and 10 fire reels. The well-drilled crew donned MSA sets and gathered at the permanently-available man-rider at the back of the TBM. The TBM engineer and foreman went to the fire control panel but this was inactive as it was connected to the mains supply. They were thus unable to activate the sprinkler system. Extensive repair work was required following the fire. The site took the precaution of constructing two water-tight bulkheads at the portals prior to repair work, and a third bulkhead to enable compressed air to carry out these repairs.		compressed air; construction method; fire management; TBM; tunnel design; tunnel repair							O'Donoghue, B.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The water main will be constructed in a tunnel driven through soil, 35m underneath the riverbed. The 1,000m long, 3.5m diameter tunnel will be excavated under the Fraser River at pressures of up to 6 bar using an EPBM. The south shaft will serve as the launch shaft for the TBM. The shaft will be sunk using slurry diaphragm walls for primary ground support that are 13m internal diameter and nominally 68m deep. The shaft will be excavated in partially flooded conditions before placing a Tremie concrete base. Inclinometers will be used throughout the process to ensure ground movements do not exceed design tolerances. The north shaft will serve as the receiving shaft and facilitate the removal of the TBM. To properly dissipate the EPB pressures from 6 bar to atmospheric to allow for safe and efficient extraction of muck from the working chamber, the total length of screw conveyor has been extended and a double screw system has been used on the Port Mann TBM.		construction method; ground conditions; ground movement; pressure effect; pressure field; TBM; tunnel design; British Columbia; Canada; Fraser River							Rafie, K.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The Northgate Link, or North Link, component of Sound Transit's 23-mile north-south regional mass transit system is a 4.3 mile light rail extension. Connecting the University of Washington to Northgate, via the densely-populated Roosevelt neighborhood, the alignment is mainly in tunnels through soft ground with the last mile elevated as it reaches Northgate's shopping mall. From the University of Washington Station (part of U-Link), the North Link alignment continues north, underground to the U-District Station, then to the Roosevelt Station, also underground. The tunnel will end at a portal and the remaining mile or so will be elevated to the third station, Northgate. Sound Transit will advertise the tunnel construction contract this month and it includes all of the TBM tunneling, the portal at the north end of the alignment, cut and cover excavations for the two underground stations and cross passages.

Detailed analysis of the geological characteristics provides important reference material for selecting a suitable laying method during the planning phase of a project. Planners can also assess whether the desired pipeline diameter can be laid directly in the existing geology, or if laying in stages is required. In case of homogeneous conditions, this assessment is always easier than in conditions with a mix of geologies. The important influencing. In contrast to the HDD method, where the opposite relation applies, in applications using the Direct Pipe method the maximum drilling length increases with the pipe diameter. Because the Direct Pipe method involves thrusting the pipeline into the ground in sync with drilling the bore hole, it substantially reduces the risk to the terrain compared with the HDD method.

Environmental monitoring is getting an increased focus from tunnel clients, designers and contractors. Alex Conacher speaks to a variety of the parties to find out some of the main concerns, and what developments are being made in thinking and technology. Working in the tunnel the air quality was appalling with the workers frequently being dragged senseless up to the surface to recover in the fresh air. In modern times, the view is that health and safety concerns are strong enough to ensure a protected and pleasant working environment. Although the primary causes of accidents in tunnels are slips, trips and falls, and many would have the safety focus on these, there are passive measures that can be put in place to ensure a non-toxic working environment. As evacuation is always the preferred means of worker protection, monitoring systems are key to protection in the tunnel environment.		air quality; construction method; environmental monitoring; health risk; occupational exposure; safety; tunneling; working conditions							Conacher, A.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The largest operational EPBM in the world is currently excavating the south bore of the Sparvo highway tunnel project in Italy. The outstanding size of the 15.615m Herrenknecht machine and complex geology has required 700mm thick segments with a high level of steel bar reinforcement. The production starts with the manufacture of the steel reinforcement, in a 1,800sqm area there are nine workstations. A different cage is assembled in each workstation through the welding of steel bars supplied by Sofer Carpenterie. To maintain a healthy environment, mobile aspirators of noxious gas are installed, and a series of welding machines are fed gas by a centralized plant. Each shift has 15 employees. Close to the carousel system inside the plant, there is a temporary segment storage point where segments are immediately placed after removal from the oven and subsequent de-molding.

The main focus of recent rock cutter research and development has been on metallurgy including steel treatment and alloy compositions. TBM cutters not only have to carry out their main tasks of cutting or crushing materials encountered up to 400MPa, and moving them around to removal apertures, they also have to withstand environmental extremes including ground temperatures of up to 50°C, high groundwater pressures and also intrusive dust. It is possible to design cutters in materials capable of tackling all types of ground but they would be prohibitively expensive for normal construction. However an attempt to slash costs by buying the cheapest cutters that will fit is unlikely to save money over the whole tunnel project due to early failures and especially the costs involved in unplanned interventions for cutter changes in terms of both extra labor costs and project delays.		cutting; drilling; ground conditions; high pressure; high temperature						Box, Z., Development of pressure compensated cutters for EPBs and slurry TBMs in high pressure conditions Proc World Tunnel Cong, , Bangkok, Thailand, 2012-08-18; Draney, S., Innovation in EPB cutterhead wear protection (2012) North American Tunneling Conf, , Indianapolis, US; Frank, G., Remote monitoring of gauge cutter wear in pressurized face tunnelling (2012) North American Tunneling Conf, , Indianapolis, US; Gharahbagh, E.A., Rostami, J., Study of soil abrasion testing and soil abrasivity index for application in mechanized soft ground tunnelling (2012) North American Tunneling Conf, , Indianapolis, US; Gharahbagh, E.A., (2012) Cutterhead Wear Study for EPB TBMs in Glacial Soils, , North American Tunneling, Indianapolis, US; Hauser, G.M., (2012) Brightwater BT-3 Tunnel Completion: Extending the BT-4 Earth Pressure Balance Drive in Complex Glacial Geology, , North American Tunnelling Conf, Indianapolis, US; Jensson, A., Cuttinghead tooling: Types, wear prevention, maintenance', presentation by caterpillar tunneling Canada corp to EPB Tunneling in the Toronto Area' Conf, , TAC Ontario Chapter; Langmaack, L., Grothen, B., Jakobsen, P.D., Anti-wear and anti-dust solutions for hard rock TBMs (2010) Proc World Tunneling Conf, , Vancouver, Canada, May; Walter, B., Adding 'Smarts' to cutting tools (2012) North American Tunneling Conf, , Indianapolis, US; Walter, B., Extending TBM reliability by detecting boulders (2012) North American Tunneling Conf, , Indianapolis, US; Xue, H.H.Y., (2012) 'Conquering Difficult Ground' Presentation, , ITACET Foundation, World Tunnel Congress, Bangkok, Thailand, May	Jones, M.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Innovations on Singapore's Marina Coastal Expressway have enabled faster, more cost- effective construction while meeting the state's famously tough safety requirements. The tunnel is situated in an area of manmade land consisting of 30-40m of under-consolidated marine clay with the consistency of toothpaste. This is underlain by firm Old Alluvium and topped with 15m of reclamation fill. The project is founded on a reinforced concrete base slab, supported with permanent side walls and finished with a cast roof before ground is reinstated over the top. Ssangyong and Samsung saw an opportunity to save cost and add value for LTA by using deep cement mixing (DCM) instead of jet grout ground improvement.

Various forms of tools have been tried for mechanical cutting of rock as part of the general development of tunneling equipment. Most of these have involved the localized crushing of hard rock and simultaneously releasing chips of rock from the tunnel face between the cutting lines of the tools. The force may be applied perpendicularly, as with disc cutters or point-attack road header picks, or at an angle nearer to zero such as by a drag bit. The attempted development of alternative methods to today's range of cutters took place mainly in the 19705, but as if to show that competitive development is rarely as lost cause, this period also resulted in the development by Robbins of disc cutters, of which similar designs are now used worldwide. In the context of rock excavation it is important to distinguish between the capabilities of water jets based on the water pressure developed, with or without other cutting elements.		cutting; drilling; hard rock; tunnel						Research news (1978) Tunnels & Tunnelling, 10 (1), pp. 7-48. , Bergbau Forschung.

Tunneling using slurry shields was first introduced in Singapore for the construction of parts of the Circle Line and Downtown Line Two to cope with particularly challenging mixed ground conditions of the Bukit Timah Granite formation. Slurry shields will also be used on some sections of the future Thomson Line and on the recently awarded Singapore Power cable tunnels. The importance of the five listed functions above varies in differing ground conditions, and some can become primary properties or can be considered of secondary importance. The desired properties for the anticipated ground condition, were determined in advance of tunneling, based initially on the foreseen geology, but then refined further during the tunneling works. The tests produce a numerical value, but in most cases the importance is to track the trend of change between subsequent tests and the observed behavior on the tunneling process rather than focus on the actual value and its units.		advance rate; ground conditions; slurry; tunneling; Bukit Timah; Singapore [Southeast Asia]						Anagostou, G., Kovari, K., (1996) Face Stability in Slurry and EPB Shield Tunnelling, , Tunnels & Tunnelling; December; Osborne, N.H., Knight-Hassell, C., Tan, L.C., Wong, R., (2008) A Review of the Performance of the Tunnelling for Singapore's Circle Line Project World Tunnel Congress, , Underground Facilities for Better Environment and Safety - India; Recommended practice for field testing water-based drilling fluids (2008) Ansi/API Recommended Practice 13B-1 Fourth Edition, , MARCH 2009 or ISO 10414-1: Petroleum and natural gas industries - Field testing of drilling fluids - Part 1: Water-based fluids; Longchamp, P., AFTES Recommendations Concerning Slurry for Use in Slurry Shield TBM	Jones, G.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Jean Launay of Vinci Construction explores the function of rock arch reinforcement and stresses on bolts and SCL. While the vertical and horizontal reinforcement of soils has developed following the use of fully grouted bolts to reinforce a tunnel carrying rock arch, they should be described as their functionality is similar to that of the reinforced rock arch and shotcrete, and is easier to understand. The theoretical works of Combarieu showed the functioning of soil reinforced by vertical inclusions. The inclusions are considered as friction piles, or friction and end bearing piles. The transfer of the loads brought about by a fill or a general foundation slab to a soil reinforced by inclusions occurs through an arching effect between the inclusions. The upper portion of the inclusion is in compression and is loaded along the transfer length while the lower portion behaves as a friction pile and returns the load to the surrounding soil located between the inclusions.		bearing capacity; bolt; friction; pile; reinforcement; shotcrete; slab; soil reinforcement; stress						Combarieu, O., Amélioration des Sols Par Inclusions Rigides Verticales, Application à L'édification de Remblais Sur Sols Médiocres, , RFG No 44; (2005), RFG No 111. 2ème trimestreRabesajet, T., (1974)Launay, J., (1974) Les Procédés Modernes de Construction des Tunnels, , Nice Octobre Réalisation des tunnels de l'autoroute A8; Greuell, E., Thèse de docteur de l'Ecole Polytechnique (1993) Etude du Soutènement des Tunnels Par Boulons Passifs Dans Les Sols et Les Roches Tendres Par Une Méthode D'homogénéisation, , Novembre; Garbhi, K., Projet de Fin d'études, Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées (1994) Etude du Soutènement des Tunnels Par Boulonnage Dans Les Sols Cohérents et Frottant, , June; Rabcewicz, L.V., (1965) The New Austrian Tunneling Method., , Water Power November December 1964, January; Rabcewicz, L.V., (1969) Stability of Tunnels under Rock Load, Water Power, , June July August; Kastner, H., (1971) Static des Tunnel und Stollenbaues.

GRP bolt technology has since found widespread application in mining and civil engineering. Compared to steel, GRP has advantages that can be traced to the properties of the composite material. GRP bolts simply consist of a composite of resin and fiber that is manufactured through the pultrusion manufacturing process which was developed in the early 1970s. FiReP fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) Powermesh was developed to comply with standard grid applications while providing the added benefits of durability and cut ability. High load capacity at each joint, compared to that of welded mesh, is unique and makes the design of FRP grid reinforced concrete structures a viable option for engineers and mining support structures.

Rhian Owen reports on the replacement of the viaduct with more stable infrastructure. During the 6.8 magnitude quake one person died from a heart attack, 400 people were injured, downtown Seattle was faced with power outages, and property damage occurred to the air traffic control tower at Sea-Tac Airport and the Alaskan Way Viaduct, a two-level overpass highway along the waterfront. Since 2001, debate over the viaduct has raged. City planners argued over what is best and most cost efficient for improving Seattle's waterfront safety and proposals included a cut and cover tunnel as well as the deep bored tunnel. An EPB had been recommended to the contractor, though a slurry machine had been an option as well, to deal with the difficult ground conditions.

Canada is a tunneling powerhouse with most major cities expanding their public transport and improving water and wastewater systems, drawing foreign companies to its northern locale. Meanwhile, the US makes progress on its mega projects. Canada's Economic Action Plan funneled money into infrastructure such as the 11km Evergreen Rapid Transit Line in Vancouver, a project estimated to cost CAD 1.4bn with up to CAD 417M coming from the government of Canada. The matching report for Canada finds that the tunneling and drilling equipment category had a $29.2M turnover in 2009, an increase of 9.7 per cent over 2008. Forecasts for 2015 expect a turnover of $31.3M in 2015. The bedrock of the Canadian Shield contains some of the oldest, hardest rock in the world, while past glacial eras have produced extremely variable soft ground conditions, particularly in urban areas where underground infrastructure improvement is usually undertaken.		bedrock; drilling; glacial deposit; infrastructure; public transport; tunneling; wastewater; British Columbia; Canada; United States; Vancouver							Robinson, N., Tunnels North, United States								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Crossing the Elizabeth River, Midtown Tunnel connects Portsmouth with Norfolk. The US Navy's largest installation is located in Norfolk and increasingly relies on the tunnel. The advancements in engineering since the original Midtown Tunnel was constructed in the middle of the 20th century have improved installation techniques and materials alike. Other than both being immersed tube, the new and old tunnel will have very few similarities. The new tunnel's approach on either side of the alignment is close to the existing tunnel. ERC will use sheet pile walls to protect the tunnel at the approaches, and to keep existing surrounding soils in place. As the alignment moves away from the approaches, the new tunnel will bow out into the river.		design; immersed tunnel; installation; twentieth century; New Hampshire; Norfolk [Virginia]; Portsmouth [New Hampshire]; United States; Virginia							Robinson, N.; Tunnels NorthUnited States								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Traditional tunneling is a vague term that can lead to confusion. Often it refers to hand mining regardless of the tunnel lining, in some countries such as Japan it can refer to excavation by semi-mechanized TBM as opposed to a closed shield, and sometimes it can refer to the means of support during excavation. With regards to hand mining, it is never used for excavations of serious length in modern tunneling, purely for economical reasons in an age of mechanization. Tunnel finishing work on the periphery with a spader, or interfacing a new tunnel into an old system, is more likely for the space might projects over the past 50 years, with full procedure details listed beside.

A large number of cost and time estimates are carried out before the contract is signed. The client and his experts and consultants, or the contractors, carry out estimates for the same project using all available tools such as historical data, local experience, methodologies, schedules, productivities, innovative solutions, commercial and also any business incentives. When the project is tendered and the bids received from the contractors, prices may be over or under that which is allowed. However, this is only a temporary situation and the most important is the price at the final completion of the project.

The article focuses on the development of shield tunneling in Japan. Hitachi Zosen have delivered 354 units of these machines so far. But since the 1980's, closed shields have rapidly gained popularity. The major reasons are that closed TBMs have high safety and higher efficiency compared to open shields. Shinjuku Station is one of the major stations in Tokyo, Japan. Traffic, commerce and companies are concentrated around the station and the vicinity is plagued by severe traffic jam and lack of a transfer function. The tunnel passed through a small space. To ensure an adequate earth covering of 6-7m, considering the economic value of the cross-section, a rectangular shape for the tunnel was adopted. This shield body has a rectangular shape, and each side curved. This machine digs a tunnel face with two loading machines installed to the right and left, makes a space, pushes into the space, and builds the tunnel.		construction method; efficiency measurement; railway construction; TBM; tunnel design; tunneling; Honshu; Japan; Kanto; Tokyo [Kanto]; Tokyo [Tokyo (PRF)]							Hanaoka, Y.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

East Sea lsland will eventually host a massive steelworks and accommodate the 20,000 workers expected to flock to the island. The tunnel will carry water south from Wuchuan, located north of Zhanjiang, to feed the steel works being constructed on East Sea island. The entire water transfer scheme is 26.4km long. The tunnel is needed to cross Zhanjiang bay and is being driven from East Sea island, northwards 2.7km. The launch shaft on East Sea island is cut 26.5m deep and the reception shaft on Nanshan island reaches 28.m. The bottom of each shaft is at the same depth below sea level. There were two limiting factors on the shaft depths, the height of the rock layer, which would have been costly to excavate through and the water pressure.		construction method; deep water; high pressure; pressure effect; pressure field; shaft; tunneling; China							Young, J., London, United Kingdom								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The shift towards safety and sustainable solutions in tunneling takes place on two tiers. Firstly, tunnels offer a way to protect sensitive landscapes and to reduce disruption, noise and vibration caused by motorways and other infrastructure on the surface. As blasting initiates from the bottom of the blast hole, it is vital that the burden and spacing between the holes in the blast plane is as planned. If drilling is not accurate, there is no possibility to correct the blast by charging. Therefore, to meet the challenge, the optimal and logical place to begin design of the drilling pattern is from the end of the round, that is, in the blast plane. This approach, combined with a modern accurate drilling rig, guarantees optimized excavation result. Drill plan design and the accuracy of the drilling equipment have a significant role in the overall control and productivity of a tunnel construction site.		accuracy assessment; blasting; drilling; tunnel design; tunneling							Kukkonen, J.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Compliance with the European Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD) is targeted at improving water quality through reducing the amount of untreated polluted water that is discharged into river catchment areas. In the case of the Thames and River Lee, 39Mt of diluted sewage are discharged directly into the river from combined sewer overflows annually. The system cannot cope with the current population, which is only set to rise. The original scheme far surpassed its intended design life, something to consider for the scope of the equivalent modern day scheme. A major factor to add to the complexity of the construction required is the 75m depth of the tunnel and shafts. This is to allow for a minimum flow gradient and to avoid existing underground infrastructure such as London underground metro lines and cable tunnels in the vicinity.		catchment; river flow; river water; tunneling; waste treatment; wastewater; water pollution; water quality; water treatment							Shepherd, M.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

There are two stations constructed in this section, Aiiz and Basauri, located at the focal points of the population centers in the municipality of Basauri. The substantial differences between the entrances in terms of length and vertical level are due to the orography of the municipality, the urban spread of which extends up the slope mountain on its southern side. The excavation and support works were canied out using NATM, with a heavy roadheader and an Atlas Copco two boom jumbo with baskets. It was determined that the limestones were intensely karstified and the presence of a regional fault at the point of contact between the Arraiz limestones and the Ereza sandstones was also confirmed.

The most notable and significant difference is that acrylamide is a true solution grout that contains no particulates and has a viscosity of one to two centipoise (cps) MPas. This feature enables the acrylamide grout to penetrate very small geological features that other grouts could not penetrate and to seal small cracks and fissures where groundwater seepage is occurring. The product also has an adjustable gel set time from a few seconds to several hours which enables the operator to determine the product travel before it forms a gel. Engineers and consultants elected to perform a pre-excavation grouting program around the perimeter of the two shafts prior to construction to prevent problems with water and gas entering the shafts during excavation and construction.		crack; fissure; grouting; tunneling							Gentry, J.; Chemicals Firm Avanti InternationalUnited States								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The main factors contributing positively to tunneling projects in Europe are, on one hand, the move towards European integration, which can only be made through communication of people and goods and the awareness of climate change and the need of development of sustainable infrastructure. The way chosen in Switzerland to finance NEAT has been totally different, as they are financed from a separate budget with different sorts of incomes that have been secured from the beginning.

The Brenner Base Tunnel (BBT) is a railway line running through the Jps, connecting Austria and Italy. At 64km long it will be the longest underground railway connection in the world; a pioneering work of engineering. The BBT will be primarily for freight transport, allowing a shift of traffic from road to rail. Passenger trains will also be able to travel through the tunnel. Due to an almost horizontal gradient, tunnel trains will no longer have to cope with steep up and down slopes. The existing rail corridor running over the Alps is the most overloaded traffic corridor, and is continually under development. It has inclines of up to 28mm/rn, resulting in slow movement of rail freight. The BBT will remove the steep inclines, and so dramatically increase the volume of freight along the European north-south corridor. It was necessary to produce a guide design, to create a basic platform to provide a very clear approach in how to deal with the project.		railway; tunnel; Australia; Italy							Bergmeister, K.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

International projects such as the TEN-T networks, with sections linking north and south, east and west are driving demand for tunnels. As the Eurozone financial and political sectors face another crunch moment to see if Greece has been austere enough to deserve it is final round of bailout loans, tunneling, while competitive, is still strong. It appears that, as might be expected, the Alps constitute the most active center for tunneling in the region, with other localized areas of activity, such as the Bosphorus Strait. A new road tunnel crossing design contract was awarded for this bottleneck last month. Collaborative, international funding being made available to projects, as well as an influx of foreign business to these regions have provided the means, and the requirement for infrastructure upgrades.

The mistake was that NATM was turned into cookbook of the engineering codes and standards beloved of the British engineer and has since evolved into a methodology that would make Delia Smith proud. The fundamental but true criticism of the NATM is that it was never clearly defined as to what it is and is attempting to achieve. Unfortunately the same can be equally applied to SCL. Unfortunately, SCL development appears to have concentrated mainly on the sprayed concrete lining itself. On largely spurious health and safety grounds the use of lattice girders and steel mesh has been ditched and as a result we now have SCL linings double the thickness and twice the concrete strength, totally reliant on chemical additives and quality control of the mix and application for holding it up in the roof.		concrete; methodology; NATM; strength; tunnel lining; United Kingdom; Delia							Hindle, D.; State of SCL DesignUnited Kingdom								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

It discusses the current design of permanent sprayed concrete and sprayed waterproof membranes and how SCL design may progress in the future. Comparative risk assessments have been undertaken to compare a traditional sheet membrane and cast in-situ secondary lining approach with the spray applied waterproofing membrane and sprayed secondary lining for a typical sized platform tunnel in the context of soft ground tunneling in relatively impermeable ground. The advantage that follows on from this is a simplified, faster construction method, saving up to an estimated 25 per cent on program for a typical underground station compared to traditional SCL tunneling designs, with associated cost benefits. The DSL approach assumes a sacrificial primary lining which takes the temporary loads and a secondary lining to take the permanent loads.		comparative study; concrete; construction method; cost-benefit analysis; risk assessment; tunneling; waterproofing; United Kingdom						Thomas, A.H., Pickett, A.P., The design of composite sprayed linings (2011) Modem Use of Wet Mix Sprayed Concrete for Underground Support, , Tromso, Norway; Thomas, A.H., Pickett, A.P., (2012) Composite Sprayed Linings, , Alpbach, Spritzbeton-Tagung; Darby, A., Leggett, M., Use of Shotcrete As the Permanent Lining of Tunnels in Soft Ground, , Mott MacDonald Milne Award submission unpublished; Hilar, M., Thomas, A., Falkner, L., (2005) The Latest Innovation in Sprayed Concrete Lining - The LaserShell Method, 4, pp. 11-19. , Tunel - Magazine of the Czech Tunnelling Committee and the Slovak Tunnelling Committee TA/ATTES; Tucker, N.J., Stephenson, S., Chilton, S., Sequential excavation method tunnelling in weak sandstone using innovative methods (2010) HKIE CMI Division Conference; Naybr, D., Stephenson, S., Salak, P., Practical experiences with Sprayed Waterproofing Membrane on three tunnelling projects in the UK (2011) Underground Construction Conference	Pickett, A.; Mott MacDonaldUnited Kingdom								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

P H Ferreira and Alfredo Piroddi of South African material and services supplier Minova RSA look at the use of thin sprayed liners and lessons that can be learned from experience in the mining industry. Thin sprayed liners (TSL) can address the above mentioned problem. The installation of surface support using remote and rapid spraying techniques has the potential to minimize interference with the mining cycle and reduce costs. TSLs can be applied essentially on or at the face to keep the small key blocks in place and reduce the potential of gravity induced fallouts of small pieces of rock. If unraveling is not prevented, the support resistance within the rock mass will gradually decrease and the demand on the surface support will inversely increase. Being in intimate contact with the rock surface, the coating action of TSLs bridges joints, effectively penetrate fractures and bond the rock mass together, thus restricting inter block movement.

The article focuses on the underground tunneling work through the North-South line in Amsterdam. All have suffered movement over the ages and are sensitive. Even outside the historic center itself there are further pile-founded buildings from the end of the Second World War and equally vulnerable. The original system has been upgraded with the advent of modern laser-based total stations which do not require prisms for accurate readings. These now supplement the building readings with distance reflections direct from the road surface, which means settlement effects can be detected earlier and more directly. Unusual three section telescoping hydraulic rams were also fitted to the machine for its push forwards from the segment ring, shortening them and their mounting points. The shortened shield also articulates at the 55 per cent point along its length to further tighten turning capacity, helping it achieve bends in the alignment down to a 140m radius.		construction method; ground conditions; ground settlement; metro system; railway construction; tunnel design; tunneling; underground construction							Greeman, A.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The article describes how engineering innovations and skills of the engineers made the North-South line metro project in the historic city of Amsterdam a success. The new project was to avoid any past difficulties by using modern tunneling methods, with some major innovations. It would pass underneath the city, leaving old buildings intact and unaffected. Planners and designers believed modern techniques would make the work possible. But they all posed huge difficulties. The Netherlands is famously mostly below sea- level and most of its geology formed by glacial, marine and estuarine deposits, in other words soft, water-filled ground, setting major challenges for tunnels and ground works. Three layers of sand alternate with medium soft clays beneath the peaty top ground, he explains. The first is the traditional founding for historic buildings, the second at roughly 40m depth is used for modern buildings and the third 60m down for a few very high rise modern towers.		civil engineering; construction method; ground conditions; innovation; metro system; structural geology; tunneling; underground construction; Amsterdam [North Holland]; Netherlands; North Holland							Greeman, A.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The March BTS meeting marked the launch of the joint ITA and BTS guidelines for good working practice in high-pressure compressed air (HPCA). BTS input had been through its Compressed Air Working Group. HPCA is being used or considered for contracts from Hong Kong and China, through Singapore and London to vancouver and Seattle involving pressures from five to 10 bar and future contracts with theoretical maximum pressures of 10 to 15 bar are also being considered. The guidelines are aimed at all parties involved in HPCA work including regulators, clients, designers, contractors and insurers. Non-saturation exposures typically allowed 45 minutes working time at six bar. Saturation exposures should be considered from five bar upwards, and should be used from seven bar upwards. Continuing the theme of minimising exposure, Werner Burger gives the design features to reduce the need for compressed air interventions.									Mayer, C.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The article describes how engineers used immersed tube technology to pass through the North-South line in Amsterdam. The immersed tube section, being carried out in 2012, is relatively straightforward compared to many other large and deep immersions worldwide, says Maurice Reijm, senior project engineer for contractor Strukton. The roughly 450m long construction pit was created from an old yacht marina on the north bank of the river and was used to make the elements two at a time. The contractor Zink built the under station element there as well as the three units required for the river crossing. Because of the strange shape he says, the units have a tendency to deviate slightly in the water and need constant correction by the tugboats. This will be part of the challenge in the autumn when they are brought from the Suez. It means ensuring a five tug configuration with four on pulling ropes to adjust the course and one pusher tug.		construction method; ground conditions; metro system; railway transport; technology adoption; tunnel design; tunneling; underground construction; Amsterdam [North Holland]; Netherlands; North Holland							Greeman, A.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The cut and cover technique has been used successfully for shallow tunneling and deep tunnel portals for many years utilizing a host of different techniques to retain the in situ soils in cut to allow the cover to be constructed. These have been cost effective alternatives to bored tunnels and where space constraints in an urban area restrict the use of large open earthwork cuttings. Cut and cover tunnels can be constructed in one of two ways. These are bottom up and top down. Bottom up is the simpler system, where the walls are constructed, excavation of the box is carried out, the base is installed and the cover or permanent props are constructed. Diaphragm walls are a heavy-duty wall that tend to be employed where a stiffer wall is required or where the depth of wall precludes use of secant piled walls due to the verticality and depth.		construction method; cut and cover; diaphragm wall; ground conditions; tunnel design; underground construction							Soletanche, B.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The three stations along the central underground section of the line, Rokin, Vijzelgracht and Ceintuurbaan, have all been a major challenge to construct, each within a huge underground box of diaphragm walls and concrete floors. They are on the critical path for the work and delays here have been the main factor in stretching out the project schedule. Space limits between the buildings mean the finished station here is 11m wide, just under 13m during excavation. To fit the line in, the tracks have to be stacked one over the other instead of side by side. The box is therefore deeper at 31m, if not much more than Vijzelgracht. Full excavation depth reached 33m. Installation was done using an observational method with modifications to the installed pattern made as measurements were taken, and core samples retrieved during the subcontractor's work.		construction method; diaphragm wall; ground conditions; railway construction; tunnel lining; tunneling; underground construction							Greeman, A.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The article explores the results of converging nozzles on loss of impulse, a history of the research, and the latest solution. The actual thrust can only be found by measurement. Action and reaction are equal and opposite so the thrust provided to the air can be evaluated by measuring the reactive force on the fan, as specified in ISO 13350. On a fully reversible fan this approach does not give any real benefit. Should the deflection vanes be attached at some distance from the fan ends, the pressure drop could be reasonably reduced but only a proportion of the spreading plume would be captured and turned, so again the benefit is reduced. The Mojet has been demonstrated to have a sound physical basis, and the CFD analysis has supported this. However, true confirmation can only come with a real installation, or in a test carried out at a 1:1 scale.

The main challenges of tunnel excavation have passed at Ingula pumped storage project in South Africa. The underground construction effort has switched to final lining. Concreting works are also underway for the powerhouse cavern foundations to hold four massive pump-turbine units. But the main challenge was the geology for the underground works. The geology comprises relatively weak sedimentary rock with some faults and fractures in the complex powerhouse area, long-term creep behavior and the relatively low insitu stress at depth for the twin power tunnels. The Ingula pumped storage scheme has been designed to work under a rated head of 441 m between two reservoirs, the upper Bedford and lower Bramhoek, both new impounded water bodes and positioned approximately 6 km apart. The hydraulic system will hold 21GWh, or almost 16 hours of energy generation, although it would take about 20 hours of pumping to charge the system.		ground conditions; in situ stress; sedimentary rock; sedimentary structure; structural geology; tunnel lining; tunneling; underground construction; underground storage; South Africa							Reynolds, P.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The requirement to increase the capacity of a section of road tunnel first emerged at the start of the 1990s, during a study to widen a 40km section of the Al Milan-Naples motorway between Orte and Fiano Romano, near Rome, Italy. The design concept of this project was developed by Pietro Lunardi during the construction of the Baldo degli Ubaldi' single vault underground station for the Rocksoil-designed extension of Line A of the Rome metro between Ottaviano and Battistini stations. Active arch lining refers to a lining that produces immediate confinement of the surrounding ground, without waiting for it to deform and push down on the extrados. A lining of this type is formed by erecting an arch of prefabricated reinforced concrete segments. This is immediately rendered a load-bearing structure by two opposing flat jacks inserted in the key segments which artificially apply the axial compressive stress needed to contrast the loads to be born.		project design; road construction; road transport; tunnel design; tunnel lining; tunneling; Italy; Lazio; Roma [Lazio]; Rome; Carangidae						Lunardi, P., Mechanical precutting fa the construction of the 21.5 m span arch of the Baldo degli Ubaldi station (1997) Gallerie e Grandi Opere Sotterranee, (53). , and others text in English and Italian; Lunardi, P., Construction des stations de grandes portées pour métro (1999) ETH-TunnelbauSymposium, 99. , Zurich, 18 March 1999; Lunardi, P., Une methode de construction innovante pour elargir les tunnels routiers, autoroutiers et ferroviaires sans interrompre la circulation; son application au tunnel de Nazzano sur l'autoroute A1 Milan (1999) Naples, Atti Delia Conferenza Su Instandsetzung Von Tunneln, 21. , Often, October 1999; Lunardi, P., The construction of large-span stations for underground railways (2000) Tunnel, (8). , December; Lunardi, P., Calcerano, G., A new construction method for widening highway and railway tunnels, Atti del Congresso Intemazionale su Progress in Tunnelling after 2000 (2001) Milan, , 10 + 13 June 2001; Lunardi, P., Un metodo costruttivo innovativo per allargare gallerie stradali, autostradali O ferroviarie senza interrompere il traffico: L'applicazione alla galleria Nazzano sull'autostrada A1 Milano-Napoli (2003) Stradě & Autostrade, (2); Lunardi, P., Widening the bad at Nazzano (2003) Tunnels & Tunnelling International, , July; Lunardi, P., Lunardi, G., Cassani, G., Widening the Nazzano motorway tunnel from two to three lanes + an emergency lane without interrupting traffic, Atti del convegno Intemazionale su (2007) Tunnels, Drivers of Change, , Madrid, 5-7 November 2007; Lunardi, P., Design and construction of tunnels (2008) Analysis of Controlled Deformation in Rocks and Soils, p. 575. , SPRINGER, Berlin Heidelberg, Available also in Italian (Ed.

Logistics planning begins with accurate drawings from the engineering department with input from the project manager. Components are most often transported by cargo vessel to ports around the world, and then trucked to jobsites. Air freight is generally reserved for emergency shipments of spare parts, due to its high cost. A similarly complex shipping scheme was needed recently for the Stephandsminda hydropower project in Georgia. The 5.5km headrace tunnel and 68MW power plant construction sites are located 160km from Tbilisi in the mountainous Kazbegi District of northeastern Georgia. Snow often blankets the area, which is more than 1,70Gm high and dips to sub-zero temperatures during the winter.

Passive fire protection is an essential requirement for any type of transport tunnel. While tunnels make a major contribution to modern transport networks, they also pose some significant challenges when it comes to protecting them from fire. Yet that protection is an essential requirement, given that the limited scope for escape and a lack of easy access means that a major tunnel blaze can have potentially disastrous results. Passive fire protection will slow the spread of fire and limit the damage caused by high temperatures, thus providing more time for occupants to escape. They inhibit the escalation of a fire and can also be used to protect elements of an active system such as power supplies or pipe work. Many passive measures also offer thermal and acoustic insulation benefits, which makes them even more attractive.		damage; fire; transport structure; tunnel design; tunneling							Appleton, S.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The materials and methods collectively described as passive fire protection for tunnels are of varied types and mixed benefits. The importance of passive fire protection is often not just a matter of reducing recovery costs by protecting the tunnel structure. Most types only come into play at higher temperatures when life in the tunnel is, hopefully, saved. Another approach in creating fireproofing barriers is spraying fire-resistant material onto the surface to be protected. Advantages include a close fit to the structure or service lines to be protected. Using advanced robotic applicators such as the Meyco's Robojet, applying the correct thickness of lining in the correct places can also save costs and achieves tolerances that are impossible with manually applied products. Application rates at 150-250m2 per hour depending on the specified thickness. Recent applications of Fireshield 1350 have included the Bodio section of the Gotthard rail base tunnel and the Soderledtunnel safety upgrade in Stockholm, Sweden.		fire management; tunnel design; tunnel lining; tunneling; Stockholm [Sweden]; Sweden						Adfil, U.K., Ignis Passive Fire Protection System, Company Product Brochure on Monofilament Polypropylene Fibres; Beard, A., Carvel, R., (2005) Trie Handbook of Tunnel Fire Safety, , Eds Thomas Tetford, London 2005; Breunese, A., (2009) Efectis (Netherlands) Presentation at Fire Protection Workshop, , Meyoo Global Underground Construction, 2009; Clement, F., Focaracd, A., Fire protection in tunnels: Requirements, solutions and case histories (2010) Proc World Tunnel Cong, , Helsinki, 2011, ITA; Khoury, G.A., EU tunnel safety update' (2005) Tunnels & Tunnelling International, 2-7, pp. 827-834. , Feb 2005 41 -43, Progressive Media Group, LondonCanada-US Rock Mechanics Symposium	Jones, M.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Phases one and two focused on constructing the radial routes spreading outwards from a center point. Phase three will add circles to connect these radial routes and phase four, if it goes ahead, will extend the radials while adding more circle routes. The 30 tunnel drives called for this record-breaking number of TBMs working in a single city. Of the 124km to be added to the metro in this phase, 35km were underground.

Additionally the required torque for drilling in the soil sample at variable rotation and thrust will be monitored, thus indicating different torque requirements in various compacted soil-additive-water matrices.		abrasion; drilling; grain size; prediction; soil mechanics; TBM; tunneling						Gharahbagh, E.A., Rostami, J., Gilbert, M., Tool wear in soft ground tunnelling - Developing a reliable soil abrasivity index (2010) Proc North American Tunneling Conference 2010, , SME UCA, Colorado, USA; Gharahbagh, E.A., Rostami, J., Tackling a new soil abrasivity index' (2010) North American Tunneling Journal, pp. 16-18. , Sep 2010; Jakobsen, P.D., Dahl, F., Langmaack, L., Reduzierung der Hartgesteins-Abrasion durch Einsatz von Schaum (2009) Tunnel, 8, pp. 40-47. , 2009, Bauverlag, Gütersloh, Germany; Jakobsen, P.D., Dahl, F., (2010) Soil Abrasion in TBM Tunnelling, , Korean Tunneling Association on Mechanized Tunneling; Langmaack, L., Grothen, B., Jakobsen, P.D., Anti-wear and anti-dust solutions for hard rock TBMs' (2010) Proc World Tunnelling Cong, , Vancouver, 2010, ITA-ATTES & Tunneling Assoc of Canada; Nilsen, B., Dahl, F., Raleigh, P., Holzhäuser, J., Abrasivity of soils in TBM tunnelling' (2006) Tunnels & Tunnelling International, pp. 36-38. , Mar 2006, Progressive Media Group, London; Nilsen, B., Dahl, F., Raleigh, P., Holzhauser, J., Abrasivity testing for rock and soils' (2006) Tunnels & Tunnelling International, pp. 47-49. , Apr, 2006, Progressive Media Group, London; Nilsen, B., Dahl, F., Raleigh, P., Holzhauser, J., SAT: NTNU's soil abrasion test' (2006) Tunnels & Tunnelling International, pp. 43-45. , May, 2006, Progressive Media Group, London; Nilsen, B., Dahl, F., Holzhauser, J., Raleigh, P., The new test methodology for estimating the abrasiveness of soils for TBM tunnelling' (2007) Proc Rapid Excavation and Tunneling Conference (RETC), pp. 104-116. , 2007, SME; Rostami, J., Gharahbagh, E.A., Palomino, A.M., Mosleh, M., Development of soil abrasivity testing for soft ground tunneling using shield machines' (2012) Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology, 28, pp. 245-256. , 2012, Bsevier; Thuro, K., Singer, J., Kasling, H., Bauer, M., Determining abrasivity with the LCPC tesť (2007) Proc 1 St Canada-US Rock Mechanics Symposium, 2-7, pp. 827-834	Jakobsen, P.D.; Norwegian University of Science and Technology, (NTNU - Trondheim) and SINTEFNorway								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The second most populous country in the world, India makes most people think of crowded streets full of noise and commerce. Economists see it as a wealthy nation ripe for trade deals. Most tunnellers probably think of the incredible rates of infrastructure construction to meet demand. The Indus River flows from the Tibetan Plateau to the Arabian Sea. Though largely in Pakistan, which depends on the river for water, part of the 'Father of Rivers' runs through the Jammu and Kashmir region of India. This is a boon for energy-hungry India, and hydropower development on this stretch of water is extensive. of the world. The contractor is commonly asked by the client to carry all of the risk. This has meant that contractors in India have been unable to make large profits and is a risk to the Indian tunneling business. India is a harder place to do business than many other countries in the world, though of course nowhere is easy enough.		infrastructural development; risk; tunneling; underground construction; India; Pakistan						Data and analysis by: timetric.comEase of Doing Business Rankings, , www.doingbusiness.org/rankings	Conacher, A.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The Pir Panjal railway tunnel is a key element of the new Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla broad-gauge railway through Jammu & Kashmir. It is not only the longest railway tunnel in India and the second longest in Asia, but is also being constructed under very difficult conditions of both geology and access to the site. Tunnel construction was split into four contracts, of which cc was awarded the great majority. Contract VA also includes slope stabilization, slope protection and portal construction at the south portal, and an 85m-Iong connection to the access adit. Similarly contract VB includes construction of the north portal. The tunnel is aligned approximately north- south on a straight route for its entire length through the Pir Panjal pass that connects the Banihal valley at the south end with the Kashmir valley at the north end. Vertically the base tunnel passes under mountainous terrain with a maximum overburden of 1,100m.		railway transport; slope dynamics; slope stabilization; terrain; tunnel; India; Jammu and Kashmir; Kashmir Valley						Pir Panjal Railway Tunnel T80, , Geoconsult India, company project report.

Lighting is a key factor in minimizing transport tunnel operating Costs whilst maintaining or improving safety. New designs of low-energy, low-maintenance luminaires promise much, but equally important is how they are installed and used. Siteco Beleuchtundtechnik, an Osram business involved in tunnel lighting design and installation, has been involved with the first tunnel installations of LED luminaires in Germany and elsewhere in central Europe, but also supplies earlier types of luminaires as required by both the tunnel conditions and operators. The corrosion-resistance of the stainless steel case is enhanced with safety glass and an additional protective coating. The luminaires have an 1P66 protection rating against foreign matter and impact. The tunnel approaches are equipped with different Siteco luminaires including 126 NIRO custom luminaires within a dynamic traffic control system and recessed within lateral concrete surfaces and bordering the cycle and pedestrian route around roundabouts.		light; safety; tunnel design; tunneling; Germany							Jones, M.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Mexico's sinking capital finished tunneling its first new metro line in a decade in March 2012. The dynamic project has been well planned from TBM assembly through its completion on March 1, 2012, making it a standard for urban tunneling in complex conditions. At more than four hours per day on average, commuters from the southern neighborhood of Tahoka often spend much of their time in buses and cars traveling to and from work in the downtown area of Mexico City. The variation in conditions required initial muck removal using a sludge pump for the clay, which was changed out with muck cars after passing through Eje Central Station as the ground became harder. Tunneling is located in the complex geological strata of the Valley of Mexico, which was founded on what was once an island in the middle of Lake Mexico, then subsequently drained.		capital city; metro system; TBM; tunneling; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico [North America]; Mexico City; Valley of Mexico							Willis, D.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The neighboring bores on the Pando-Monte Lirio-EI Alto hydro cascade scheme in Panama were set to present the possibilities for unsual challenges for TBMs. The geology consists of highly variable lahar volcanic rock, an uncommon barrier for shields to penetrate. There was potential for quite different experiences within as well as between the drives, and that has proved to be so as excavation has started. As mud flows with such different possible origins, the slurries have quite varied characteristics which further change with progress of the flows, both dropping out material as well as gaining inclusions. Then, solidified, each flow is termed a lahar, and the properties of each matrix are highly varied, even locally. Encountering loose lahar and large water inflows, the machine was stuck, it adds. Seli says that a top heading of approximately 20m in length was excavated to free the shield.		hydroelectric power plant; lahar; mudflow; TBM; tunneling; volcanic rock; Panama [Central America]							Reynolds, P.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The lighting industry as a whole, including small specialist Sectors such as tunnels, has been undergoing great Changes in the last decade. Changes in light source technology, more product suppliers, low energy and maintenance requirements, and even the design of longer and wider tunnels are the leading factors in a sometimes confusing array of procurement considerations. A major characteristic of the lighting market is the huge number of very similar LED luminaries being made available from many different manufacturers in Asia. These are chiefly located in China but also emanate from Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand and other countries. These markets also have varying levels of supplier service support available. Faced with a marketing onslaught, many operators and their consultants have wisely sought independent verification before investing too much faith and money in new designs.		light; tunnel design; tunneling; underground construction; China; Korea; Philippines; Taiwan; Thailand							Jones, M.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The Arroyo Maldonado tunnel project in Buenos Aires, Argentina aims to prevent the floods that periodically inundate the surrounding area of the Rio de Plata river. Some 15km of tunnels are located in difficult urban areas with little overburden. Enrico Dal Negro, Alessandro Boscaro and Richard Schulkins of the Mapel Underground Technology Team explore the difficulties. The project involves the construction of two 7gm-diameter tunnels, with the function of catching and conveying rain water to Rio de Plata River. The client is Gobierno de Ia ciudad de Buenos Aires, with Geodata as designer and Ghella as the contractor. Several tests carried out, firstly in the laboratory using the raw materials received from Buenos Aires and later at the job-site, were useful in finding the most appropriate mix-design according to all the specific requests coming from the project, in terms of pumpability, volumetric stability, jellification and mechanical strength development.		flood control; rainwater; tunnel design; tunneling; Argentina; Buenos Aires [Argentina]; Rio de la Plata						(2005) (French National Tunnelling Association), Choosing Mechanised Tunnelling Techniques, , AFTES, Pans; (2005) Specification and Guidelines for the Use of Specialist Products for Mechanized Tunnelling (TBM) in Soft Ground and Hard Rock, , www.efnarc.org, EFNARC; Guglielmetti, V., Mahtab, A., Xu, S., (2007) Mechanized Tunneling in Urban Area, , Taylor & Francis, London; Linger, L., Cayrol, M., Vinci, L.B., TBM's Backfill Mortars - Overview - Introduction to Rheological Index; Pelizza, S., Peila, D., Bono, L., Dal Negro, E., Schulkins, R., Boscaro, A., Analysis of the performance of two component back-filling grout in tunnel boring machines operating under face pressure (2010) Proceedings of ITA-AITES World Tunnel Congress 2010: Tunnel Vision Towards 2020, , Vancouver, 14 20 May 2010; Thewes, M., Budach, C., Grouting of the annular gap in shield tunnelling - An important factor for minimization of settlements and production performance (2009) Proceedings of the ITA-AITES World Tunnel Congress 2009 , , Safe Tunnelling for the City and Environment, Budapest, 23-28 May 2009	Dal Negro, E.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The lighting installation for the Eastern Busway Two Buranda to East Brisbane, Logan Tunnel was commissioned on 13 July 2011. Like all modern transport tunnels, the Logan Tunnel was clad with interior wall panels, the characteristics of which were carefully specified in the design documents. The application of the reflective panels is intended to provide a higher degree of ambience in the tunnel, improving the visual performance of drivers. With reflective walls the comfort level of the driver is improved, as the dark tunneling effect is reduced. The measurement tool used would be the same luminance meter that was being used to test and commission the carriageway luminance values. Measurements were taken for luminance on barrier surface adjacent to vehicle, carriageway in front of vehicle, bright spots on wall adjacent to vehicle and the headlamps in low and high beam. The vehicle was then moved 10m closer to observer position and the measurements taken again.		light; luminescence; tunnel design; tunneling; Australia; Brisbane; Queensland						Reflection Properties of New Zealand Road Surfaces for Road Lighting Design, , March 2010 -M.

UK gas and electric power network operator National Grid is engaged in a major renewal program to ensure power supplies for the future. One aspect is to install high-voltage cables underground to renew the grid in major urban areas, starting with London. The site is on a natural slope. Preparation of the site included some demolition and the creation of a suitable level surface by retained backfilling, and so creating enough storage space. The initial London Power Tunnels project has several strategic purposes for National Grid. Firstly it will renew the aging main electricity supply routes in the capital, replacing cables of old design that are now approaching the end of their life. Secondly it will provide for the continuously changing power needs of the conurbation. Heavy lifting plays a key role in the set up and operation of the Fade Road and other drive shaft sites of the project.		electricity generation; electricity supply; tunnel design; tunneling; urban area; England; London [England]; United Kingdom							Jones, M.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The Atacama region in South America is a very large mining area producing great volumes of copper and gold, which together are the largest GDP providers in Chile. Labor comes from not only Chile but also the neighboring countries. The miners are drawn to the higher paying locations which are also the most dangerous. The scene of the 2010 accident was the San Jose mine in northern Chile. It started life in 1889 with the existing headgear over the access shaft having been in place since around 1910. The ropes for this do not go down the full depth of the mine, so were no good for the rescue from the deep levels. The 8.5km long ramp used to access the mine face had completely failed. It is believed that over mining of the ramp structure itself led to the collapse. In an effort to make the mine more productive, the operator had re-mined the ramps support structure for any gold or copper left in it.		accident; collapse; mine; support structure; Atacama; Chile							Robinson, B.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

It is well known from tunneling experience that even small convergences of 100-200mm, which would not be problematic in conventional tunneling, may lead to major problems both in the machine and in the back-up area. The computational model was kept deliberately simple, taking into account axial symmetry and the Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion. Concerning the risk of shield jamming, it is essential to have information on frictional force when designing a new TBM and when assessing the feasibility of a proposed TBM drive. The suitability of the nomograms for a quick and cost-effective preliminary assessment of a TBM drive in squeezing ground will be shown by means of an application example concerning a common situation which confronts the tunneling engineer on a regular basis in the planning phase.

The West Island line (WIL) will extend the Mass Transit Railway corporation (MTIRC) Island line (ISL) from the existing Sheung Wan Station to the western district of Hong Kong Island, and add approximately 3.3km of underground route to the existing line. The two WIL caverns will be the first station caverns built by MTRC for over 25 years and will be the first caverns of these spans to be built beneath Hong Kong's densely urbanized areas. There was little local precedent to guide development of the design concepts, which also had to be developed under close scrutiny from Buildings Department and the Geotechnical Engineering Office. Experience with cavern engineering from overseas was combined with knowledge of local practice and design standards to produce an approved reference design. The cavern will be excavated using drill and blast methods with temporary support to enhance the intrinsic stability state in order to provide adequate stability reserve at all stages of construction.		cavern; drill and blast; railway transport; tunnel design; China; Hong Kong; Hong Kong Island						Bandis, S.C., Rock characterization for tunnelling (1997) A Rock Engineer's Perspective, Felsbau, 15 (3); Bandis, S.C., Sharp, J.C., Mackean, R.A., Bacasis, E.A., Explicit characterisation and interactive analysis for engineering design of rock caverns (2011) Proceedings of the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers and Hong Kong Institute of Planners Joint Conference on Planning and Development of Underground Space, , in-print; Barton, N., (1998) NMT Support Concepts for Tunnels in Weak Rocks, , Tunnels and Metropolises, Negro Jr & Ferreira (eds.), Balkema, Rotterdam; Barton, N., Bandis, S.C., Rock joint model for analyses of geological discontinua (1987) Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Constitutive Laws for Engineering Materials: Theory and Applications, pp. 993-1002. , Tuscon, Arizona; Barton, N., Bandis, C.S., Predictive capabilities of the JRC-JCS model in engineering practice (1990) Proceedings of the Internationa Conference on Rock Joints, pp. 603-610. , Loen, Norway; Barton, N., Uen, R., Lunde, J., Engineering classification of rock masses for the design of tunnel support (1974) Rock Mechanics, 6 (4); (1992) Guide to Cavem Engineering, , GEO, Geotechnical Engineering Office, Geoguide 4, Geotechnical Engineering Office, Civil Engineering Department, Hong Kong Government; Grimstadt, E., Barton, N., Updating the Q-system fa NMT (1993) Proceedings of the International Symposium on Sprayed Concrete, , Modem Use of Wet Mix Sprayed Concrete fa Underground Support, Fagernes, Norwegian Concrete Association, Osb; (1997) Design Standards Manual Section 4, , MTRC, Civil Engineering (Rev.

Average expenditure on site investigation (SI) for underground construction it has been reported has reduced to around one per cent of project costs, whereas the expenditure on site instrumentation and monitoring for a project in progress, particular in urban areas, has increased. This obviously reflects concerns about the consequences of third-party damage cause by settlement, but appropriate investment in information collection before final project plans are made will reduce project risk, including that of third party damage. In any case, some degree of site investigation will be needed to select appropriate sites for monitoring instrumentation. For their part, exponents of site investigation have adopted new technologies aimed at minimizing the time and cost involved in site investigation, as well as improving accuracy.

Jet grouting involves inserting a hollow drill bit like a hypodermic needle into the ground and injecting cement grout at pressure so that it mixes with surrounding material. Victoria Station Upgrade is being delivered by joint venture contractor Taylor Woodrow-BAM Nutgall (TWBN) under a design and construct contract, with shared gain/pain. Consultant Moti MacDonald developed LU's concept design, helped steer the project through the statutory processes and is now working as the designer for TWBN. Construction is taking place smack in the middle of one of the UK capital's busiest transport interchanges. The square cross section achieved using hand mining also provides the same passenger capacity as a cylindrical tunnel but with a saving on width. Frames will be installed at 650mm centers.		grouting; metro system; mining; tunnel lining; tunneling; United Kingdom							Mylius, A.; Mott MacDonaldUnited Kingdom								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Tunnelling induced settlements in London clay	2012	Tunnels and Tunnelling International		APR		30	33			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84874173035&partnerID=40&md5=3937d11c36156789f587a502cddec181		Stroud, S.	The basic concept of effects of tunneling on buildings describes the transverse settlement trough caused. The trough conforms to a classical Gaussian equation that can be derived from a fundamental parameter in settlement assessments, the volume loss. A volume loss of around one per cent has been established in many cases in London clay. A number of factors control volume loss, but controlling the face pressure is an important element in controlling ground movement. Mixed ground conditions can- give rise to fluctuations in face pressure but London clay is more uniform and it is easier to keep face pressures broadly constant. Centrifuge modeling tests have examined the modification factor in some detail. Structures of different stiffness and tunnels at different depths and positions in relation to the structure were idealized. If extracting fluid from the annulus of the modeled tunnel accurately controls volume losses, Greenfield settlement troughs can be produced which, with the addition of a flexible building, are similar.		building; centrifugal model test; ground conditions; ground movement; ground settlement; London Clay; tunneling						Farrell, R.P., (2010) Tunnelling in Sands and the Response of Buildings, , Ph.D Thesis, University of Cambridge; Goh, K.H., (2010) Response of Ground and Buildings to Deep Excavations and Tunneling, , Ph.D thesis, University of Cambridge, UK; Franzius, J.N., Potts, D.M., Burland, J.B., The response of surface structures to tunnel construction (2006) Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Geotechnical Engineering, 159 (1), pp. 3-17. , http://www.extenza-eps.com/TELF/doi/pdf/10.1680/geng.2006.159.1.3, DOI 10.1680/geng.2006.159.1.3; Mair, R.J., Tunnelling and geotechnics: New horizons. 46th Rankine Lecture (2008) Géotechnique, 58 (9), pp. 695-736; Mair, R.J., (2011) Tunnelling in Urban Areas and Effects on Infrastructure - Advances in Research and Practice, p. 33. , Muir Wood Lecture 2011 delivered at World Tunnelling Congress, Helsinki, May 2011, published by International Tunnelling and Underground Space Association, ISBN: 978-29700624-4-8; Nyren, R.J., Standing, J.R., Buriand, J.B., Surface displacements at St Jameses Park Greenfield reference site above twin tunnels through the London Clay (2001) Building Response to Tunnelling: Case Studies from the Jubilee Line Extension, 2, pp. 387-400. , London: case studies, Editor(s): Buriand, Standing, Jardine, CIRIA and Thomas Telford, 2002, ISBN:9780727730176; Potts, D.M., Addenbrooke, T.I., Structure's influence on tunnelling induced ground movements (1997) Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Geotechnical Engineering, 125 (2), pp. 109-125. , Thomas Telford, London; Standing, J.R., Buriand, J.B., Unexpected tunnelling volume losses in the Westminster area, London (2006) Géotechnique, 56 (1), pp. 11-26; Standing, J.R., Selman, The response to tunnelling of existing tunnels at Waterloo and Westminster (2001) Building Response to Tunnelling: Case Studies from the Jubilee Line Extension, 2, pp. 509-546. , London: case studies, Ed'itor(s): Buriand, Standing, Jardine, CIRIA and Thomas Telford, 2002, ISBN:9780727730176; Viggiani, G., Standing, J.R., The treasury (2001) Building Response to Tunnelling: Case Studies from the Jubilee Line Extension, 2, pp. 40-432. , London: case studies, Editor(s): Buriand, Standing, Jardine, CIRIA and Thomas Tetford, 2002, ISBN:9780727730176; Wongsaroj, J., (2005) Three-dimensional Finite Element Analysis of Short and Long-term Ground Response to Open Face Tunnelling in Stiff Clay, , PhD Thesis, Cambridge University	Stroud, S.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Trends in the design of modern site investigation rigs have generally kept up with trends in all, chiefly surface, rigs for more efficient, environmentally acceptable drives, better safety as regards operator protection, and the prevention of excessive load handling by the introduction of mechanical drill-pipe handling devices. The manufacturer's Diamec rigs dedicated to coring with diamond or tungsten carbide coring bits are in smaller units, facilitating their use underground, chiefly in the mining industry, and so lending themselves to portability. Atlas Copco also supplies larger reverse circulation rigs for deeper bores with sampling of the drill chippings. The same criteria of accurate recording of the coring horizon and orientation apply as far in-hole testing. Unless the ground consists of competent rock with few fractures, special equipment may be required to recover a useful core in soft or incompetent ground.		drill bit; drilling; drilling rig; ground conditions; site investigation							Jones, M.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The planning of a tunneling project starts with the ground. In renovation work, the ground may play a part, but the main consideration is the state of the existing underground structure and whether it can be made to meet changing needs and modern standards. In many circumstances it may be tempting to solve such problems by relatively expensive, but readily available, new build. Indeed this may be the only adequate solution, but with experience and innovative thinking, the problems of deteriorating or inadequate tunnels can be resolved more economically. Sewers can be a major renovation need, especially in older urban areas where the asset may well be over a century old and brick-built. In more recently developed sewerage systems, often in tropical or sub-tropical climates, the high ambient temperatures can increase corrosion rates of a concrete fabric, necessitating lining with a less corrodible materials, such as glass-fiber-reinforced plastic (grp), or replacement.		corrosion; safety; sewer network; subterranean environment; sustainability; tunneling							Jones, M.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

TBMs in squeezing ground conditions	2012	Tunnels and Tunnelling International		MAR		16	20			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84874181186&partnerID=40&md5=a6d7dfde81be2cc4ee75c9ed45182361		Ramoni, M.	The expression squeezing ground is commonly used with reference to large deformations of the opening after excavation. If an attempt is made to hinder the ground deformations, a high ground pressure may develop upon the tunnel support endangering its structural integrity. The space available for ground deformations in TBM tunneling is very limited, due to the fixed geometry and the limited flexibility of the tunneling equipment (TBM and back-up). The performance of a TBM is the result of a complex interaction between the main system components ground, tunneling equipment (TBM and back-up) and tunnel support. The advance rate influences this interaction too and is not only a result of it. In order to resume TBM operation, the thrusting system must be able to cope with the forces acting upon the cutter head and the shield. In order to move the TBM forward, the effective available thrust force must be higher than the frictional resistance (static friction).		deformation; ground conditions; TBM; tunneling; underground construction						Bockli, O., (2008) Teilabschnitt Faido - Bisherige Erfahrungen Mit Dem TBM-Vortrieb, pp. 49-58. , FGU-Fachtagung für Untertagbau, Swiss Tunnel Congress 2008, Luzern, D0229, SIA Zürich; Flury, S., Priller, A., Gotthard base tunnel - Part-section Faido (2008) Tunnel, 2008 (4), pp. 47-51; Gehring, K.H., Design criteria for TBM's with respect to real rock pressure (1996) Tunnel Boring Machines - Trends in Design & Construction of Mechanized Tunnelling, International Lecture Series TBM Tunnelling Trends, pp. 43-53. , Hagenberg, A.A.

It will connect the Southwestern Motorway (5H20) at Mt Roskill to the Northwestern Motorway (SH1 6), providing a 48km motorway. In early 2009, the government announced it as one of the seven Roads of National Significance', because it will improve transport links and contribute to the country's economic wellbeing. In August 2011, NZTA announced that it had chosen its preferred bidder for the project construction. The project attracted a high level of interest both nationally and internationally and was awarded to a specialist team, known as the Well- Connected Alliance, to manage the design, construction and operation.		motorway; project design; TBM; tunnel design; tunneling; underground construction; urban area; Auckland; New Zealand; North Island							Owen, R.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Australian Architect Hassell has taken on the task of producing the masterplan for the project while Aurecon Australia will be in charge of integrating the North West Rail Link with New South Wales' existing transport infrastructure. As the topography of the land between Cudgegong Road and Bella Vista is fairly flat, planners fear that the addition of a rail link will not only bisect the local community but also have a significant impact on the existing road traffic network and pedestrian footpaths.		railway construction; railway transport; transportation infrastructure; transportation planning; tunnel design; tunneling; underground construction; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales]							Walsh, K.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

When planning future tunnels the alignment should avoid or limit passing through active faults, and avoid placing tunnels too close to slope faces when planning future tunnels. The paper provides a reference for seismic design and construction procedures of tunnel. Longitudinal cracks observed in some tunnels were developed and extended along the whole tunnel. This kind of damage pattern was often found at the crown and shoulder of the tunnels. Cracks in the concrete lining were also developed perpendicular to the direction. Inclined and transverse fracturing: Single fracturing inclined at 30 to 60 degrees to the horizontal was observed. Steel reinforcement damage was found in some of the tunnels, with steel bar distortion and elastic deformation.		construction method; deformation; earthquake damage; elastic property; mountain environment; seismic design; tunnel design; underground construction						Wenchuan Earthquake, , http://www.csi.ac.cn/sichuan/index080512.htm, CSI, China 150[DOI]; Protection of underground structures against seismic effects on underground works' (1984) Advances in Tunnelling Technology and Subsurface Use, 4 (3), pp. 71-117. , ITA 1984 ' 1984; St John, C.M., Zahrah, T.F., Aseismic design of underground structures' (1987) Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology, 2 (2), pp. 165-197. , Bsevier, 1987; Hashash, Y.M.A., Seismic design and analysis of underground structures (2001) Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology, 16, pp. 247-293. , Bsevier, 2001; Wang, W.L., Wang, T.T., Su, J.J., Assessment of damage in mountain tunnels due to the Taiwan Chi-Chi earthquake (2001) Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology, 16 (1), p. 133. , Bsevier, 2001	Hu, H.; Southwest Jiaotong UniversityChina								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

MMSR ventured into the notorious Yarra Delta geology for the first time since the late 1800s. In addition to providing valuable insights into the geology and hydrogeology for future of tunneling projects in Melbourne, the MMSR has delivered an on- grade wet cofferdam crossing of the Yarra River, excavated 35 shafts using a variety of methods, and utilized five different boring machines to construct a total of 4.2km of new sewers. Information from inflow rates and existing groundwater monitoring systems was used to develop two- and three-dimensional hydrogeological models.

Tropical cyclones, government priority shifts and that nasty financial crisis sweeping the globe have all hit the tunneling industry down under. The industry hits the ground running. Ian Hosking, industry director of infrastructure services for Aecom's Australasian operation points to the growth from 50 to 150 engineers in its core ground and tunneling divisions over the last four years. On the Airport link however, the three-lane sections meant a 15.5m TBM would have been required, so it was still more economical to use roadheaders. In the two-lane sections where variable ground was anticipated, they used TBMs. Funding for civil infrastructure has dried up according to Day. The warchest of money has been diverted to stimulus following the global financial crisis and most of the state governments have limited resources.

The last lane has just come into service along with the rest of the improved parts of the northbound motorway to finish the NZD 340M scheme. NZTA was established in 2008, combines the functions of Land Transport New Zealand and Transit New Zealand to provide an integrated approach to planning, funding and delivery of transport schemes. One such transport challenge was how to resolve the congestion of the motorway system at Victoria Park.

Brighton and Hove lies on the south coast of England almost due south of London. Following the adoption of the Urban Wastewater Directive by the European Union in 1991, Southern Water committed to a new wastewater treatment works to replace the existing screening plant and long sea outfall to the east of Brighton. A substantial ground investigation gave confidence that competent chalk would be encountered during the tunneling, for which a Pressure Balance TBM was selected, this being the old Channel Tunnel land service tunnel TBM which was upsized and modified to take a screw conveyor. However, once again, very substantial groundwater inflows caused enormous difficulties, most significantly in the latter half of the tunnel following a change in chalk horizon. The majority of problems encountered on the earlier tunnels were related to groundwater inflows, and so the project team tried to keep the alignment above the water table as far as was practical.		groundwater; inflow; TBM; tunneling; waste treatment; wastewater; water table; water treatment; Brighton and Hove; East Sussex; England; Peacehaven; United Kingdom							Spiby, K.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

EEGf is the specific energy used to rotate the cutterhead against the terrain previously indented by the TBM cutter. In normal conditions, EEGf accounts for 31-41 per cent of the total specific energy of excavation SEE. Contrary to the EEGr, the higher values of EEGf correspond to much lower ratings of RMR. In the opposite case, when the rock mass loses its strength and becomes unstable at the tunnel face, the cutters have great difficulty in being effective, then the other component EEGf amounts to 100 per cent of the total energy.

Vaclav Pavlovsky and Ales Gothard explore Metrostav's involvement in tunneling access shafts for a western metro expansion to the neighboring city, Espoo. The Lansimetro project provides a new transportation link between Helsinki and Espoo, with a capacity of 100,000 passengers a day. It directly links to the only operating metro line. Increasing demands for transport required the neighboring cities to be interconnected with the new 14km link. The existing backbone metro line with the annual carrying capacity of 50 million passengers is 21km-long. The cross-sectional area of the tunnels varies from 31 to 58m2, the rock cover is 5 to 40m high. From the geological point of view, the excavation passes through hard rock, mostly granite, and under the water table. The quality of the rock mass is generally very good, and favorable for tunneling. However, it is variable, ranging from sound compact formations to significantly fissured local failures draining groundwater and sometimes containing sedimentary intercalations.		cross section; excavation; failure analysis; granite; groundwater; hard rock; shaft; transportation; tunnel; water table; Espoo; Finland; Uusimaa							Pavlovsky, V.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Hitachi Zosen has developed special TBM backup equipment and rock crushing systems. Yasuharu Hanaoka of the corporation's engineering department, industrial business unit, and Katsuya Sasaki of the product development division, machinery and infrastructure headquarters, present this paper on automatic segment erection, boulder or concrete demolition and the labor-saving results. Since the construction route of the projects includes a sharp, 120m-radius curve, a manual type of stock conveyor is adopted. However, in other projects, an automatic stock conveyor can be used to transfer the segments directly to the segment feeding system. In order to realize a high speed, each system performs its role in parallel as much as possible without causing interference. The screw diameter and the lift head are 300mm and 5m respectively. Any number of screws can be connected straightly because the support sections coupled with a drive shaft are installed at the top and the bottom of the system.		construction; crushing; demolition; feeding; infrastructural development; product development; TBM						Sasaki, K., Development of splitting technology by using electric discharge impulse crushing system (2011) International Society of Explosives Engineers Proceedings of the 37th Annual Conference on Explosives and Blasting Technique, pp. 301-311	Zosen, H.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Denmark's capital expands its metro system by two-thirds with its new ring line, the Cityringen. The cityringen project comprises an underground metro system within the urban center of Copenhagen, Denmark. Copenhagen is the capital of Denmark with a population of approximately one million inhabitants. In 2002 the first metro line was inaugurated and is a driverless, fully-automated system operating 24/7. The system currently in operation is 23km-long with 8km being underground along with nine of its 22 stations. The ground conditions along the alignment of Cityringen comprise a quaternary sequence of melt water sands and tills resting on Danian limestone. The quaternary deposits are overlain by fill as well as post- and late-glacial deposits. Each of the 20 deep constructions along Cityringen will be built below the groundwater table and will extend into the primary aquifer of the Copenhagen Limestone in the southern part between Aksel Mollers Have and Kongens Nytorv.		aquifer; late glacial; limestone; meltwater; railway transport; till; Denmark							Notarianni, S.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Popular attention to the complexities and increasing size of modern TBMs often leads to overlooking the increasing number of functions that have to be performed with equipment just behind the cutterhead and shield. The entire structure was 600m long and weighed nearly 2,000t. In addition to more normal TBM back-up duties, the worm's function is to recycle rock spoil into tunnel lining. Like the worm, each MSD. Whilst each TBM back-up system tends to be unique as demanded by the characteristics of the project, the diameter of the tunnel is a common limiting parameter for all the equipment that has to be carried. Robbins senior designer Mike Anderson compares the situation to that of making a sausage. One of the trickiest places in any tunneling operation, especially within the back-up area, is the invert. Anything can end up there to make a nuisance for smooth operations.		equipment; TBM; tunnel lining; tunneling							Jones, M.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn. Tunn. Int.	Review	Scopus

Abu Dhabi's public sector has pioneered a range of contract approaches to ensure successful delivery of its new super sewer. Abu Dhabi Sewerage Services Company (ADSSC) urgently needs to increase the capacity of its wastewater network and is currently implementing a master plan. At the same time mechanized tunneling had not been done in Abu Dhabi before so people understandably expected that disruptive cut and cover methods would have to be used. However over time ADSSC convinced the authorities that not only could the deep tunnel be safely constructed without disturbing homes and businesses, it was the best option for providing the much needed new capacity and ensuring that there would be no issues with odor developing. As well as being the program manager, CH2M Hill also has a responsibility to its client under the contract to provide professional training in both an active and passive way. So work shadowing, formal training courses and mentoring are all important components of the project.		public sector; sewer network; tunneling; wastewater; Abu Dhabi [United Arab Emirates]; United Arab Emirates							Ballantyne, B.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Nicole Robinson discusses how San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) will carry out the replacement of the Hetch Hetchy Regional Water System in the face of earthquake-delayed TBM, environmental concerns and alignment limitations. SFPUC is undertaking its $4.6bn Water System Improvement Project to repair and replace the Hetch Hetchy Regional Water System, which serves 2.5 million people. This program focuses specifically on seismic upgrades to ensure high-quality drinking water after an earthquake or during a drought. An EPBM had been recommended to the contractor, though a slurry machine had been an option as well, to deal with the San Antonio formation, a silty clay with some sand. Toward the end of the alignment the tunnel is anticipated to encounter Francisco bedrock for roughly 700ft (213m), and for this the machine has the ability to be outfitted with a full set of 10-inch disc cutters.		distribution system; drinking water; regional planning; repair; seismic design; TBM; tunnel design; water planning; water supply; California; San Francisco; United States							Robinson, N.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Selection of excavation method is one of the most complicated and vital decisions in tunnel construction planning. Developments over recent years in tunnel excavation methods have greatly increased the capabilities of tunneling overall, but they have rarely simplified choice, depending on project conditions. The broad range of possibilities within conventional excavation includes hydraulic excavators and hammers. The second part will cover some of the factors involved in choosing the TBM method, and the choice of TBM type, and try to draw some conclusions. Continuous mechanical excavation, as with TBMs or roadheaders, should produce relatively low vibration. Other than a simple reference laser beam, more complex laser guidance used to be the reserve of TBMs, but now blast-drill jumbos and roadheaders can be equipped with systems that not only ensure accurate alignment of excavation progress but incorporate pre-programmed profiles that assist operators in avoiding over- or underbreak.		development project; TBM; tunneling; vibration							Jones, M.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The starting point for the most economical tunneling method selection has to be the ground or rock condition, especially in terms of strength and stability. The size of the project, in all dimensions and locations, is also a crucial factor. The diagram indicates the capabilities of and relationships between three popular excavation methods for medium-to-hard rock. Drill and blast can be applied to a wide range of dimensions, depending on the size of the drilling equipment chosen. A limit for mechanized drilling at the lower end is determined by safety considerations when working around machinery for drilling and loading out in a narrow space.

Mobility is promoted by the availability of diesel power packs rather than having to handle high-voltage cable feeds for the electro-hydraulic drives. Successful roadheader guidance and profile monitoring systems have now been developed by VMT, Geodata and others. Using a console screen displaying the preprogrammed design profile, the roadheader operator can guide the cutterhead in its optimum excavation sequence up to the profile limit, using continuous calculation of the cutterhead position.

Belgian contractor Denys is preparing a series of pipejack drives for the latest phase of the sewerage improvement scheme along the bay in Algiers. The microtunneling project will jack concrete pipes below the built-up and industrialized coastline, passing below roads, railways and a number of buildings, though always above groundwater level. The entire scheme will be 25km long to drain flows to southwards from the west arm of the bay, and then southeast inland, to the existing treatment works in Barik. The pipejacking is to be performed between five shafts constructed, or modified, for the microtunneling works, shafts P1 - P5, which run from the southern end to the north in that order. A Denys group company, Socea, will manufacture concrete pipes for the pipejackin. Tunneling will be done using a Herrenknecht AVN 1800 TBM and intermediate jacking stations at about 100m intervals.		development project; pipe; shaft; tunneling; underground construction; Alger [Algeria]; Algeria; Algiers							Reynolds, P.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Formwork and concrete mixtures are increasing the efficiency of cast in situ concrete tunnel lining. Euroform, a company in the Herrenknecht group, has developed a new system of tunnel formwork or shuttering that is versatile for different tunnel dimensions. The EP Shutter has a modular design can therefore be used several times, and is easier to handle. Euroform also supplies vibrating systems reinforcement carriages and concrete distribution systems. Putzmeister's Telebelt is a dedicated extending conveyor system that can be used to place concrete at substantial distance from the source, but generally at similar levels or in the invert. BASF's Crystal Speed Hardening (CSH) X-Seed 100 is a liquid suspension of crystal seeds containing synthetic nanoparticles designed to boost the hydration process of early-age cement. Putzmeister has introduced a new Sika-PM4207 concrete spraying system to customer-specified options.

Larger tunneling projects requiring substantial amounts of concrete, whether sprayed or cast will need their own batching plants on or near the surface working site. The use of New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM) in the construction of the 11.7-mile Phase 1 of the GBP 3.31bn Dulles Corridor Metrorail Project in Washington DC involves the use of a special dense sprayed concrete mix including microsilica and steel fibres. A Liebherr Easymix 1.0 plant was used for mixing purpose. The main mixer is a standard 1m 3 ring pan mixer, with 48kW drive, but with the addition of a rotary agitator to better ensure a consistently high quality mix. CIFA's range of concrete batching and mixing plants include both dry and wet work. CIFA's latest truck mixer addition to a wide range is the HD 12 +, which, on a 4-axle carrier with a capacity of over 45t, is designed for heavy-duty applications including payload capacity of over 12m 3.		concrete; development project; mixing; railway construction; tunneling; District of Columbia; United States; Washington [District of Columbia]							Jones, M.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Several ambitious tunneling projects are currently being constructed in the southern European and Mediterranean region, despite the economic instability. The USD 1.7bn Vitoria - Bilbao - San Sebastian rail tunnel project in the Basque region of Spain requires the construction of a series of tunnels. The longest, the Albertia tunnel runs for 4.8km, the Udalaitz tunnel at 3.2km, the Zaratamo at 2.7km, the Induspe at 2.3km, the Galdakao at 1.8km, the Ganzelai at 1.4km and the Luko at 970m. Mont d'Ambin Base Tunnel will be one of the longest in the world, measuring at 51km, when it is completed. The French and Italian governments, as well as the European Union are providing the funding for this USD 9.5bn project. Milan metro extension project will feature tunnels on lines 1 to 6, with two on line 3. Sicily to Tunisia crossing is the largest project on the map. It also envisages the construction of four artificial islands along the route.		development project; European Union; government; railway construction; tunnel design; tunneling; underground construction; Basque Country; Mediterranean Region; Spain; Albertia							Conacher, A.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Tunneling in the Thessaloniki base metro (TBM) in Greece face the challenges of archaeological discoveries, sensitive structures, geology and worksite availability. Thessaloniki base metro line is being developed by Attiko Metro based in Athens. The early challenges for the tunneling works and advancing the TBMs included securing passage below the 15th Century, seismically-weakened Alkazar mosque, but also some difficulties with some recently-built parts of structures for the metro. Ahead, the shields face softer ground, older structures and continued archaeological works around part-build stations. The soft ground for the remaining drives is expected to comprise sand, silt and lower clay content with groundwater pressure around 1.5 bar. In the late 1990s, an effort to have the metro line developed under concession failed and by 2003 the procurement and funding approach had turned to employing both state and EU funding. There followed an extended procurement period that included a few stages before shortlisted parties bid and, finally, the contract was awarded.		failure mechanism; ground conditions; TBM; tunnel design; tunneling; Athens [Attica]; Attica; Central Macedonia; Greece; Thessaloniki [Central Macedonia]; Thessaloniki [Thessaloniki (DPR)]; Thessaloniki							Reynolds, P.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The means of delivery must be reliable and available in tunneling operation, compact enough to work within tunnel section availability and convenient to use at the point of delivery where space is also likely to be at a best. Rail transport specialist Muhlhauser (KHM) offers a wide range of rolling stock for concrete and ingredients transport including both standard and custom-made designs. Standard Muhlhauser concrete remixer cars, with longitudinal axis rotation, have electrohydrostatic drives and a range of capacities from one to 14m 3. Normet Utimec's concrete transport vehicles include a transferable cassette system called Multimec, one cassette of which is a concrete remixer. The Putzmeister range of vehicles can be applied to most operations up to 220m 3/h delivery and 40MPa (400bar) pressure.

It is inappropriate, if not meaningless, to attempt to apply limit state design methods, such as those encapsulated in Eurocode 7, to the design of primary support for tunnels in rock, particularly weak rock or any rock under high stress. By reference to some 41 case histories of major tunnel failures, this article shows that more than 85 per cent were the result of unexpected geology or hydrogeology. It is submitted that the unknowns and uncertainties in geology and hydrology cannot be properly dealt with by applying codified factors to geotechnical parameters. It is concluded that working stress methods should be retained for tunnel support design, and that such design would benefit, far more, from competent geological and hydrogeological understanding, than from faith in code factors.		failure analysis; geotechnical engineering; rock mass response; stress; support structure; tunnel design						Bolton, M.D., Limit state designin geotechnical engineering (1981) Ground Engineering, , September; Day, R.A., Wong, P.K., Poulos, H.G., Fifteen years of geotechnical limit state design in Australia.

Tunneling is flourishing in Italy, with four major projects under construction and a further eight at the tender, design or financing stage. The most significant project being built is the EUR 3.2bn widening of a 62.5km section of Italy's A1 between Bologna and Florence and construction of a 37km bypass, known as Variante di Valico (variation of crossing) through the Apennine mountains. Stretching from La Quercia in the north to Barberino in the south, the Variante di Valico project includes 18 tunnels with a total combined distance of 17.9km. The other main road tunnel project is a EUR 150M program of restoration to 96 tunnels in the Lombardy. Rome's Metro Line C is among the most significant and challenging infrastructure projects underway in the world. The Milan Outer East Orbital is a EUR 1.5bn project that is a 33km new toll road linking the Milan-Venice A4 motorway and the Milan-Bologna A1 motorway between Agrate Brianza and Melegnano.		development project; infrastructure planning; motorway; road construction; road transport; tunnel design; Apennines; Italy							McKenna, J.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Nicole Robinson examines how tunneling for Brisbane's Airport Link and related projects is on track with a little help from revising the alignment. The Airport Link, Northern Busway (Windsor to Kedron) and Airport Roundabout Upgrade projects are being delivered together in a single design and build contract. BrisConnections, consisting of Macquarie Capital Group, Thiess, John Holland, Arup and PB, was awarded the contract worth $4.8bn in May 2008. The 6.7km toll road will be primarily underground and will allow drivers traveling from the city to the airport to avoid up to 18 sets of traffic lights. Moving the location of the TBM launch avoided interference with a local high school and emergency services in the area, however it introduced other issues, as the park is prone to flooding. Generally, geology in the project area is mainly regionally metamorphosed rocks, including hardened shales, greywackes and quartzites.

South East Queensland's entire rail network is capacity-capped by its reliance on passage over a single bridge at the hub of the network in Brisbane. The Merivale Bridge that spans the Brisbane River is the bottleneck of the entire South East Queensland rail network. SEQIPP, along with infrastructure projects from each of the states stands alongside the Government of Australia's Nation Building Program (NBP). With the reference design determined, the environmental impact statement, including the required duration for public comment or objection, and business case are the next steps. The entire detailed feasibility phase has an expected completion date somewhere in mid-2011. Construction will primarily be undertaken by driven tunneling, using two shield TBMs driving parallel from the southern portal to Woolloongabba Station in the middle of the alignment. A series of bores and geotechnical investigations have been undertaken to ascertain the nature of the geology along the study corridor.		geotechnical survey; railway construction; TBM; tunnel design; tunneling; underground construction; Australia; Queensland							Conacher, A.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The human factor, including both management and worker attitudes, is especially important in the working environment. Tunneling can viewed as the meeting of the overly macho attitude of much of the construction industry with the instinctive hazard awareness of the well-trained miner. Other physical threats may not be obvious until an emergency arises, such as inadequate egress routes or ventilation in the event of a fire. The design of safety into equipment, and making sure that safety keeps up with production technology, is vitally important. Virtually any hazard found in tunneling can be greatly reduced by the correct use of technology and design, from controlling working methods to providing the best working environment possible, and from guarding machinery to testing for gases and dust. Safety and health are much more than watching where you go, providing personal protective equipment.		construction industry; health and safety; mining; TBM; tunnel design; tunneling							Jones, M.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Alex Conacher reports how record levels of government investment in infrastructure continues the tunneling boom in Australia as the networks creak with the strain of growing industrial requirements and the demands of a highly urbanized population. The Nation Building Program is one of these spending initiatives. Through this short-term, high-value scheme, the Government of Australia is investing $36.6bn in road and rail. The states each have their own initiatives for infrastructure investment. New South Wales has the State Infrastructure Strategy, South Australia has the Strategic Infrastructure Plan, Tasmania has the Tasmanian infrastructure Strategy, Victoria has the Victorian Transport Plan and Western Australia has several more specific ventures such as the Main Roads Project.

Maurice Jones examines the issues involved in tunneling occupation health, and some other safety hazards, followed by some solutions while drawing heavily on material supplied by Donald Lamont, formerly of the UK Health and Safety Executive. Donald Lamont reports that there is a general low-level of concern over occupational health in construction, aggravated by a previous lack of 'safety culture' in the industry and a macho image/attitude to working practices. It appears that while attention to more obvious and better-known health hazards has substantially improved, overall care for occupational health has not. Major sources of noise in tunneling are drilling equipment, cutterheads, pneumatic and hydraulic power tools, fans and to a lesser extent transport systems. Dust can be categorized into inhalable dust, respirable dust into gas exchange regions of lungs or the more serious respirable crystalline dust at 0.1 mg per m 3 limit.		hazard; health risk; occupational exposure; safety; tunneling							Lamont, D.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

P Greenwell and M Mills of Navigant Consulting examine the evaluation of program and quantum aspects of change in respect of live tunneling projects. A retrospective evaluation requires investigation of the actual position and the separation of the impact of other changes from the change under consideration. While the process of retrospectively unpicking strands of cause and effect from the final position can be complex, the parties are at least aware of the final outcome. The extent to which there will be a contractual entitlement to an extension of time or prolongation will depend upon the requirements of the contract and the responsibilities identified for the change and other impacts occurring during the period. In order to ensure that the program remains sufficiently current both the contractor and the engineer/project manager must perform.

Fathi Tarada, Managing Director of Mosen, discusses whether smoke ventilation is required for tunnels under construction in light of recent dangerous incidents. In the UK, a serious fire occurred in the Channel Tunnel Rail Link's (CTRL) Thames Tunnel on 16 August 2005. Two construction workers were killed in a fire that broke out in a diesel locomotive drawing a construction train south through the 2.5km-long, 8.15m-od eastern bore of the tunnel. As evidenced by the incidents in the Niagara River Diversion Tunnel, Vega del Ciego Tunnel, CTRL Thames Tunnel and others, fires can generate a significant volume of smoke, even with relatively low heat release rates that do not threaten the structural integrity of the tunnel linings. Although the provision of emergency ventilation is not specified by the relevant tunneling standards, the number of recent tunnel fires and explosions as well as their resulting casualties should give us reason to reconsider.

Since the underlying data is relatively old and mostly from tunnels with diameters <6.0-7.0 m, this material is no longer up to date. Also, there has been considerable progress since 1990 in TBM technology, in particular as far as cutters are concerned (material, shape, and diameter of disks). The changed situation has motivated a research group consisting of five university institutes from the Alpine region to pick up the topic of the prediction of penetration rate and cutter wear, with the objective of developing a completely new or improved prediction model. However, penetration rate is only one-although the first and majorparameter to calculate advance rate. The prediction of advance rate is essentially a task of construction planning, in which aspects of machine technology, operation, organisation and logistics must be taken into account. A simple straightforward calculation is insufficient for doing this: calculation must happen in iterative steps. On the basis of a doctoral thesis accepted in 2004 at the University of Innsbruck, an engineering firm specialising in construction planning and economics 11 has developed the software Simtunnel Pro 2.0 making it possible to calculate advance rate in a comprehensible way, taking all conceivable influences and basic conditions into account.		advance rate; cut and cover; TBM; tunnel; tunnel design; underground construction						Home, L., (2005) Penetration Rate Baseline Dilemma, pp. 4-5. , T&T North America, June 2005; Buchi, E., (1984) Einfluss Geologischer Parameter auf die Vortriebsleistung Einer Tunnelbohrmaschine (mit Besonderer Berücksichtigung der Gesteinsanisotropie), , Dissertation, University of Berne, 1984; Barton, N., (2000) TBM Tunnelling in Jointed and Faulted Rock, pp. 51-56. , AA Balkema, Rotterdam 2000; Bruland, A., Hard rock tunnel boring - Advance rate and cutter wear (1998) Project Report 1B-98, NTNU Trondheim, 1998, pp. 33-40; Alaber, M., (2008) An Integrated Approach to Penetration, Advance Rates and Disc Cutter Wear for Hard Rock TBM Drives, pp. 29-37. , Geomechanik und Tunnelbau 1/2008, Ernst u Sohn, Berlin; Leitmner, W., (2004) Baubetriebliche Modellierung der Prozesse Maschineller Tunnelvortriebe im Festgestein, , Dissertation, University of Innsbruck.

The increasing demands on ventilation are not only affecting the design of new tunnels but also creating a major market in refurbishment. A major development in road tunnel ventilation has been jet fans. These work mainly by inducing airflow around them, multiplying the air actually passed through each fan. The wide range of axial and jet fans available from Howden Ventilatoren features corrosion protection and flameproof motors, with auto-variable pitch or variable speed drives, and potential for up to 100 per cent reverse flow. The Banana Jet, available from Witt & Sohn of Germany, improves on installation efficiency by having a housing that directs the jet towards the tunnel centreline at an angle of seven degrees instead of a straight tube. Connols-Air of Singapore supplies the OLS SD60 smoke dampers particularly for metro systems.

Almost 41 per cent of the cost in the construction of Chennai Metro, valued at approximately INR 14,000 crores, will be met directly by the Government of India and the state Government of Tamilnadu on a 50-50 equity basis. The remainder will be funded by a loan granted by JICA. Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) Transportation Networks has awarded the USD 570M contract for the Patnitop tunnel. The National Highways Authority of India will award a semi-annual annuity for the infrastructure and services. Hydroelectric power has been another area of interest for the Indian government.		hydroelectric power; motorway; storm; transportation infrastructure; transportation system; tunneling; Chennai; India; Tamil Nadu							Conacher, A.email: aconacher@tunnelsonline.info								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Where used, the GBR has become a key contract document for a project including major excavation or underground works. It is often the first document to be read by bidders and, in the event of a dispute, the first to be revisited by the client's representative or adjudication panel. As a result, the preparation of a GBR requires specialist experience and skill in its preparation. Numerous heavy civil and underground projects are due to be constructed worldwide. It is believed that for these projects, a properly thought-through GBR is a beneficial investment for a client to give surety of costs. Similarly, potential bidders may be more inclined to tender the work if they perceive that the GBR lends an added degree of fairness under the contract.

Two computational fluid dynamics (CFD) fire simulation analyses was carried out by taking the industry standard approach and the best practice approach, for an improved approach to jet fan performing modeling. The fire is located 260m downstream of the model inlet, which is sufficient to achieve a fully developed flow field at the fire location. The results from the simulation by the industry standard approach show the velocity magnitude in a cross section halfway between a pair of fans and the extent of the smoke spreading. The results from the simulation from the best practice approach suggest that the spreading rate of the jet momentum is not sufficient to ensure a consistent, down tunnel ventilation flow. The difference is caused by the flaws of the industry standard approach, which leads to untrue predictions of the ventilation flow field for cases where the prediction of the jet spreading rate is critical to the ventilation system performance.		computational fluid dynamics; flow field; jet; modeling; simulation; tunnel; ventilation						Pope, S.B., Explanation of the turbulent roundjet/plane-jet anomaly (1978) AIAA Journal; (2008) Standard for Road ∼Tunnels, Bridges, and Other Limited Access Highways, , National Fire Protection Association NFPA502, US; (2000) Best Practice Guidelines for CFD, , Ercoftac European Research Community On Flow, Turbulence And Combustion, January; (2004) Road Tunnels: Vehicle Emissions and Air Demand for Ventilation, , PIARC World Road Association	Buonfiglioli, M., Atkins, Epsom, United Kingdom								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

WRA will offer two calculation schemes for estimating vehicle emissions for a certain design year. The primary air quality criteria in the WRA report remain carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations and visibility limits, with no major changes proposed for design and threshold. The new report will offer guidance with respect to estimation of non-exhaust particulate matter emissions due to resuspension and abrasion; although it recognizes that there are large uncertainties in such estimations.

Change is an aspect of project risk, which can be effectively managed and mitigated throughout the project cycle when industry best practices are applied. Technically, change may result from a wide range of factors that modify the scope, implementation or risk profile of a project, with consequential impacts on cost and program. For major underground projects, particularly in urban areas, early consultation with key stakeholders is important in order to minimize the likelihood of changes in later stages of the project. The use of geotechnical baseline reports (GBR) is a significant development that provides a fixed contractual baseline for ground conditions. The application of industry best practice in the pre-construction stages of a project will help minimize change. Engineering contracts invariably include a clause expressly permitting the client to instruct a change and stating how the cost of the change is to be determined.		ground conditions; stakeholder; tunneling; underground construction; urban area						(2006) A Code of Practice for Risk Management of Tunnel Works, , International Tunnelling Insurance Group; Joint Code of Practice for Risk Management of Tunnel Works in the UK, by the Association of British Insurers and the British Tunnelling Society, 2003	Legge, N.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Maurice Jones reviews some of the latest developments in technologies employed underground to ensure positional accuracy during tunneling. Modern instruments can be set up in most tough tunneling environments and, in many cases, left to operate remotely in a protected position due to the introduction of motorized functions. The Leica range are direct descendents of the Wild Heerbrugg theodolites that have be widely used underground. The Gotthard tunnel client's surveyor, Vermessungsingenieure Gotthard-Basistunnel (VI-GBT), has had the main task of ensuring the correct positioning of the tunnel bores with set-out and check surveys using Leica total stations, digital levels and optical plummets. The latest digital laser theodolites from Topcon (DT-200 series) feature the same absolute circle reading technology as employed in Topcon's total stations, for high accuracy and reliability.

Mexico City's Metro Line 12 project will improve transportation options for hundreds of thousands of people daily. Many of these mountains saw volcanic activity that deposited ash into the lake, forming the clay soil for which the city is known. A low transition zone south of the alignment marks a junction of the lake and hills that formed a gradual beach between hard floors and the soft clays of the lake. Further west, to the south of Mixcoac Station, an area of high transition signifies more extensive beaches or those with a more abrupt thickness formed by alluvial soils mixed with the lake's soft clay. Tunneling has been divided into three more or less equal-sized parts, from the launching shaft to Ermita Station, from Ermita to Parque de Los Venados Station and from there to the exit shaft. The three walk-in access shafts will change as each third completes its tunnelling.		transportation development; tunnel; tunneling; underground construction; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico [North America]; Mexico City							Robinson, N.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Patrick Reynolds examines how EPB TBMs are to drive through highly variable, lahar volcanic rock to bore headrace tunnels for a string of small hydro plants in Panama. The first of the mixed-face EPBMs was tested and is now being shipped to Central America for a January launch on the 7878-m long headrace for the Monte Lirio project. Then, in February, the second machine is to start boring the 5161m-long Pando drive. Excavating the Pando and Monte Lirio tunnels will be a big challenge due to the complex and variable characteristics of the dominant lahar rock. The TBMs are designed to operate in both closed and openmodes without modifying themachine arrangement. The EPBMs are expected to operate in openmode in the presence of rockmass, including highly dense lahar and ancient lava flows.

K. G. Holter and H. O. Hognestad of BASF Meyco focus on the use of modern cost-effective methods and material technology for pre-injections in shallow tunnels. The basic idea of pre-injection is to treat the ground prior to the excavation by injecting a grout into the ground through drillholes and pumping at pressure. It is important to understand a pre-injection scheme in tunneling as a sequence of decisions made at several stages in the injection cycle. Management of the injection works is therefore a crucial factor in order to achieve cost-effectiveness. The process of bleeding, in which the cement grains separate from the grout mix and clog the entrances to the fine joints, does not occur with a stable grout mix. The headrace tunnel for the Maneri Bhali hydroelectric power project phase 2 underpasses a valley with low rock cover. The tunnel was excavated by drill and blast and supported by steel sets and lagging with concrete backfill.		backfill; cement; construction method; cost-benefit analysis; drill and blast; drilling; ground conditions; grouting; hydroelectric power plant; technology adoption; tunnel design; tunnel lining; tunneling						Holter, K.G., Dahl-Johansen, E.D., Hegrenæs, A., Tunnelling through a sandzone.

Nicole Robinson reports on the immersed tunnel of the Marmaray Project under the Bosphorus Strait in Istanbul. The immersed portion of the tunnel measures 1,387m and will eventually be met on the European side with tunnel bores made by two Hitachi Zosen slurry TBMs of 7.8m diameter. Most of the ground below the Bosphorus Strait consists of marine deposits with a small area of Belgrad formation. Two areas within the immersed tunnel alignment required ground improvement. The 11 immersed tunnel elements each measure 15.3m wide and 8.6m tall with two compartments for the rail lines. Each compartment has a 1.4m escape way and a squeeze way for maintenance. The length of the elements varies, with eight measuring 135m, two at 98.5m and one measuring 110m. Much of the immersion work on the Marmaray Project depended on the weather and sea current conditions.		boring; environmental conditions; ground conditions; ground improvement; immersed tunnel; TBM; tunneling; Bosporus Strait; Istanbul [Turkey]; Turkey							Robinson, N.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Maurice Jones reviews some of the best practices and developments to improve the chances of survival in the aftermath of tunnel accidents. Speed and location are vital factors in surviving a tunnel fire, or indeed any other hazardous incident. Securiton also supplies video-based fire detection based on the digitization and analysis of video signals from surveillance cameras. Using special algorithms the presence of smoke or fire in the image can be determined and the difference between them. Fogtec is also being installed in the New Tyne Crossing road tunnel by TT2, as well as the existing tunnel, with fire protection consulting by Halcrow. Tunnel designers cannot expect tunnel users to react to an emergency in an entirely rational way, but the best compromise must be found to encourage them to act in as calm as manner as possible to maximize the chance of survival.		accident; algorithm; detection method; hazard assessment; survival; tunnel design; tunneling; underground construction							Jones, M.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Project management and contracts play a major role in managing ground risk during tunneling. Project management and organization influence the management of ground-related risks. The law approaches these risks and how they may be effectively allocated and managed under a tunneling contract; though there is room for improvement. The incidence of major tunnel failures remains stubbornly high, particularly in the urban environment. The Nicoll Highway failure in 2004 had a number of similarities to the Heathrow collapse 10 years earlier. The Association of British Insurers/British Tunneling Society Joint Code of Practice for Risk Management of Tunnel Works is now a requirement of insurance cover for most major projects. The construction methodology, including the use of additional support measures where required for stability, should have the flexibility to deal with the full range of anticipated ground conditions.		failure analysis; project management; risk assessment; tunneling; urban area							Legge, N.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The Dorchester Collection has acquired a property at 45 Park Lane, close to its prestigious hotel in London, with the plan of refurbishing the existing building to provide a new annex comprising a penthouse suite, 45 exclusive rooms and a restaurant and bar. The 45 Park Lane building required substantial foundation work, refurbishment and internal fit-out to achieve the required standard of construction, and the contract was awarded to Kier Wallis in August 2008. Part of the works would be completed within the basement of the 45 Park Lane building during the substantial main contract refurbishment works. The initial Mott MacDonald outline shaft design included precast concrete segments installed using underpinning methodology, with the lower section of the shaft formed using a primary and secondary SCL. The precast concrete segments originally proposed for the primary lining of the shafts were substituted by steel liner plates supplied by American Commercial.		basement (building); concrete structure; foundation; refurbishment; shaft; tunneling; Dorchester; Dorset [England]; England; United Kingdom							Salak, P.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Five contractor consortia are in the running and expressions of interest have also been invited for a third tunneling contract consisting of a 2.6km section crossing the River Thames, UK. A total of 42km of TBM bores are expected for the massive $24.5bn railway, which will run eastwest across London with 118km of new railway lines starting at Shenfield and Abbey Wood and running through central London to Maidenhead and Heathrow in the west. Construction of the new 256m long, 30m wide station box began in May 2009 and set a tricky challenge for Canary Wharf Contractors (CWC), a subsidiary of developer Canary Wharf Group, which is investing $232M of the total $772M required for the scheme. The next station to get underway was TottenhamCourt Road.

Ian Clarke examines some of the methods that tunnelers can employ to cut the time and cost of tunneling. Where soft ground is present, high water table/pressure, fissured and or water-bearing or potentially unstable rock, the information provided by the ground investigation will indicate whether any form of ground retreatment is desired or necessary to prevent problems during the tunneling phase. While dewatering, or ground water control as it is sometimes referred to, may sound the simplest of the techniques being discussed there are aspects of this option that do bring various complexities with them. Deepwell dewatering systems generally comprise a series of bored wells designed to cover the area over which the dewatering activity is required to be effective. Each bore is fitted with a multi-stage electric submersible borehole pump. The general intent of peripheral freezing is to minimize the amount of frozen ground to be excavated.		complexity; dewatering; excavation; freezing; frozen ground; ground conditions; groundwater control; soft soil; tunneling; water table							Clarke, I.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The Crossrail project in the UK intends to expand rail services through and under London to Maidenhead and Heathrow in the west, and Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east. Work has started in areas like the new ticket hall at Farringdon Station. Contracts have gone also out for station work including one for GBP 500M for the redevelopment of Tottenham Court Road Tube station, and another worth GBP 700M for Victoria station - both to a joint venture of Taylor Woodrow Construction and BAM Nuttall Limited. Potential austerity measures would create another hurdle for Crossrail, not to mention the tunneling industry at large. The coalition government, elected in May, has prioritized deficit reduction as its most urgent issue, and public sector spending is under scrutiny leading up to the October 20 publication of the Comprehensive Spending Review.

John Greenhalgh of Bekaert looks at the increasing use of steel fiber concrete in UK tunnels over the past 20 years. In the UK the first steel fibre segmentally lined tunnel was the 1.4km baggage tunnel at London Heathrow International Airport in 1995. This was a design and build project by Miller Tunneling, now Morgan Sindall, in which the traditional reinforcement cage was completely removed and Dramix steel fibers used. One of the main concerns was the potential of train derailing and impacting the new tunnel lining, so it was decided that a lining incorporating steel fibers with traditional reinforcement would be the appropriate solution. Many projects followed in the 1990s, mainly in the utility sector, and into the new millennium with two major projects - the tunneling works for the new Heathrow Terminal 5 (T5 HEX) and the Channel Tunnel Rail part 2 (CTRL).

Maurice Jones reports on various technical developments currently taking place in pipe and structure jacking. In conjunction with the Aachen RWTH, Herrenknecht has been developing a pipe joint sensing and monitoring system called the Online Load Control (OLC). It has already been used in some pipe jacking applications including the Maerzenbach hydropower scheme in the Austrian Alps. Another recent development by Herrenknecht combines features of pipe jacking with horizontal directional drilling rigs. The Pipe Thruster assists the installation of continuous steel pipelines that, with conventional directional drilling, would rely mainly on the pullback force available from the drilling rig. The installation of relatively large-dimension, often rectangular-section, structures such as culverts, underpasses and subways under surface obstructions such as roads and railways, which may remain active, is something of a niche pursuit within the jacking world. Jacked Structures points out that jacking can be used to create irregular openings as well as the more usual regular sections in large dimensions.		drilling rig; hydroelectric power plant; pipe jacking; pipeline; railway transport; road transport; tunneling; Pisonia aculeata							Jones, M.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Maurice Jones reports on the completion of an alternative by-pass tunnel that was decided upon as part of the Water Supply Improvement Program (WSIP) undertaken by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC). The alternative by-pass was decided upon because the existing Crystal Springs By-pass Pipeline can be affected by seismic activity. In addition to its critical place in the WSIP with seismic upgrading, there was additional motivation for the move to replace the existing Crystal Springs Bypass Pipeline. The new tunnel is 1280m long and 2.44m finished diameter with a welded steel liner, and is due for completion in spring next year. The mix was designed and placed to provide sufficient support for the pipe once cured, but to avoid too much flotation force tending to lift the pipe. Once tunneling had been completed, installation of the pipeline could begin, and Ameron International is assigned to fabricate the water pipe.		distribution system; pipeline; tunneling; water supply; California; San Francisco; United States							Jones, M.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The most traditional material, especially in Europe, is a cementitious grout - made up of water, cement and chemical admixtures, and able to improve the mix pump-ability and to regulate its setting time. The two-component ingredients and their respective dosages have to be carefully studied in order to achieve the most appropriate solution, both from a technical and economical point of view. Once a mix-design was established in the laboratory, the technical assistance of the Mapei underground technology team (UTT) continuously tested the backfilling material produced in the job site batching plant during the first weeks of the TBMs advances.

The West Ham Flood Alleviation Scheme (FAS) serves a densely populated area of East London, approximately one mile south of the 2012 Olympic Park, and one mile north of West Ham's football ground at Upton Park. Under its commitment to The UK Water Regulator (OFWAT) Thames Water was required to take more than 5,500 properties out of flood risk by March 31, 2010, with more than 650 of these from the West Ham scheme. An initial site investigation borehole within the grounds of the Abbey Mills pumping station revealed the ground around T1 to be contaminated with benzenes and other aromatic hydrocarbons. The scheme included 18 microtunnel drives of varying lengths totaling 2.5km of 1.2mID pipes. These were intended to be driven by two TBMs, but at one point eight were employed. But the pipe following the TBM driving from MT10 to MT9 became stuck when the TBM was just 30m short of the reception shaft.		borehole; flood control; pipe laying; TBM; tunnel design; England; London [England]; Newham; United Kingdom; West Ham							Morgan, A.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Choosing the right fibre for the right use	2010	Tunnels and Tunnelling International		JULY		35	38			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-78549233013&partnerID=40&md5=025febec8e294b64c648dd09dc472b0c		De Rivaz, B.	Benoit de Rivaz, global Tunneling manager of Bekaert presents his opinions and supporting evidence on choosing the correct fibers for reinforcing concrete in underground applications. The reinforcing ability of a fiber depends on the anchorage of the fiber into the concrete, the tensile strength and its Young's Modulus. Metallic fibers have a neutral to positive impact on the fire resistance of structures. Due to a decreased spalling effect, a structure in metal fibrous concrete behaves rather better in the presence of fire than a mesh-reinforced structure for segmental lining, according to tunneling specialists. European Standard 14721 specifies two methods of measuring the fiber content of metallic fiber concrete. The test plate usually used is designed to determine the energy absorbed from the load/deflection curve. Fiber concrete is well-known for its ductility. The effect of fibers is a combination of reinforcement and networking.

Deep tunneling will start in the Middle Eastern emirate of Abu Dhabi for the first time later in 2010 in a new 40km sewer project. The organization charged with managing and upgrading the sewer network is the Abu Dhabi Sewerage Services Company (ADSSC), formed in 2005, and until 2009, a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority (ADWEA). ADSSC's masterplan envisaged that to meet such growth the best solution would be a deep sewer tunnel that would collect effluent and transfer it all to a single pumping station by gravitation. This would then move flows to a new sewage treatment works at Al Wathba. The winning bidder was announced as US based CH2MHill in February 2008. The firm was fresh from project managing Singapore's impressive 48km deep sewerage tunnel (DTS) project.

Bernard Berge, product specialist engineer of the Maccaferri fiber division examines the successful use of fiber-reinforced concrete in tunnel lining segments used in the construction of Barcelona's impressive new metro system. The fibers redistribute the forces within the concrete, restraining the mechanism of formation and extension of cracks. The result is a more ductile concrete that is able to maintain a residual capacity in the postcracking phase. Steel fibers within the concrete literally stitch the sides of a forming crack together. When completed it will be the longest and one of the deepest lines in Europe and the longest metro line in the world of entirely new construction. It will also be the most expensive enterprise the Catalan government has ever undertaken. Recently introduced Spanish legislation concerning fire protection in tunnels has obliged contractors to incorporate polymer fibers into precast lining segments.		cracking; metro system; railway construction; reinforced concrete; reinforcement; soil-structure interaction; tunnel design; tunnel lining; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Spain							Berge, B.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Maurice Jones reviews the responses to an information gathering questionnaire sent by the journal Tunnels & Tunneling International to allow readers to make their own judgments over the roles of fibers. The gathering of opinions and evidence was commenced with the issue of the independently verified questionnaire sent out to both specifiers and suppliers covering those fiber properties most often quoted as advantages or disadvantages of the two main types. Supplier respondents to the questionnaire usually indicated that major properties were important whatever the type of fiber, albeit perhaps from different perspectives resulting in major differences of opinion. Macrosythetic fibers have a disadvantage in that their track record is not so extensive as that of steel fiber re-inforcement due to their later introduction and the lack of meeting international standards so far. The efficiency of fiber performance in situ depends on adequate anchorage in or bonding with the cured concrete mix.

Many of these operate with the support of industry sponsors who provide lecturers and often funding. The Crossrail Tunneling and Underground construction Academy (TUCA) is being developed to provide training. The university's Institute for Tunneling and Construction management offers BSc and MSc programs in civil engineering. The Colorado School of Mines currently offers classes geared to tunneling or underground construction and plans to offer a minor in tunneling for undergraduate students in mining engineering, civil engineering and geological engineering majors starting in September 2010, or January 2011.

Bernadette Redfern reports on the growth of Australia's tunneling industry and a series of major upcoming transport projects set to provide a further boost to the sector. Projects like Brisbane's Cross River Rail Link, Melbourne's West Link highway and Perth Metro are also on the horizon leading to optimism within the sector. Firms reacted angrily to the news of its demise with bidders demanding compensation for their extensive bid costs. The government has confirmed that $249m has been spent on the scheme prior to its cancellation, but the bidders, which included a John Holland Tunneling/Theiss joint venture, are also pursuing compensation for their wasted efforts. The reason for the focus on tunneling can be attributed to the massive projects underway and those on the drawing board. The largest scheme on site is the Brisbane Airport Link in Queensland.

The two machines are the first ever TBMs designed by Robbins without roof shield fingers. The two TBMs are excavating from parallel launch chambers just 40m apart, with their back-up and muck haulage starting from bridges across a deep valley. Rock strengths range from 30 to 100MPa UCS. Broken, fractured rock is expected in a 915m wide section of tunnel, with three large faults specifically identified. The ground support systems on the West Qinling machines Include modified mesh installation, ring beam installation, work platforms, and materials handling. Ring beams are installed using an erector consisting of the assembly ring and expander. The rotating assembly ring is fixed axially and used to loosely assemble five ring beam components. The McNally system normally works with a curved assembly of pockets on the outside of the roof shield.		excavation; haulage; support; TBM; tunnel design; China															0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Tunnel monitoring and control Systems not only have to provide and interpret accurate information in a sometimes harsh environment, they have to prioritize this input and initiate the best actions for users' safety and operational economy. There are many different types of monitoring devices to check and measure environmental conditions and hazardous incidents, and of course tunnel equipment has its own control systems, but relatively few companies supply complete control systems. Siemens has developed a system that recognizes overheated truck brakes, even before tunnel entry so that an alarm can be sounded in the event of danger. Siemens fire protection starts with its Surveillance video smoke detection technology with patented edge extraction process. The trials detected test pool fires within 30-40 seconds after ignition, which is about half the time required by the German RABT standards.

A main strength of the NTNU/SINTEF drillability tests is that the test results may be put into prediction models to estimate time and costs of rock and soil excavation projects. TBM tunneling and rock quarrying have been developed by correlating laboratory and in situ geological data with production data from tunnel projects. The models are continuously updated and revised as new tunneling data become available. The NTNU/SINTEF method is today a recognized and widely used test method for TBM performance prediction. NTNU/SINTEF is committed to ensure end users they will get quality assured and reliable drillability test results, which can be used to obtain the best possible time and cost estimates.

A key task for the client Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVN), has been to assess the large-scale tunneling options for cost and program risk during construction. Seven options were examined, four with twin tunnels and three single tubes. When considering the tunneling risks, the double bores appeared the better financial option, and have been recommended for the headrace arrangement.

The head-race tunnel will pass through the complex Lesser Himalayan geology. Site investigation was restricted by topography limiting access and also because the tunnel will have cover frequently in the range 750m-1000m, though the overburden depth on the drive will reach up to 1,400m.

Currently there are several accepted types of design involving sprayed or sheet membranes for waterproofing, but the opinions on how these can be achieved vary considerably. The waterproofing membrane has to be considered as part of the whole lining, and its structural integrity to dealing with any ground movements and changes in groundwater pressure or potential flow. One of the major issues in sprayed waterproofing is, ironically, how tolerant the material is of water. Phil Richardson of NCD has been engaged with Stirling Lloyd and leading UK tunneling contractor Morgan Est in intensive trials of a wide range of spray-on waterproofing products to determine which of these works best, both in applications and longer term in situ.

There exists leading methods of TBM performance and advance rate prediction, taking all applicable factors into consideration, and their suitability for the conditions of the Karaj-Tehran water supply tunnel project in Iran. The penetration rate shows the velocity of machine penetration in rock and is expressed by millimeters for every rotation of the cutterhead or meters per hour. Each of the two presented methods for advance rate estimation needs parameters that sometimes require results from lab studies. Both the Barton QTBMand MRi Norway methods are empirical, based on databases both a minimum of ten years old.

Construction of the Hallandsas railway tunnels in western Sweden has often been described as the most difficult tunneling project in the world. Many readers would probably want to argue that point but there is no disputing how tricky it has been over the 18 years since construction began. The high-speed rail Scandinavian link route, which the Hallandsas Ridge lies across, will join Oslo to Sweden, and, through the Oresund link, Denmark, Hamburp and the rest of northern and central Europe. At 10km wide and tens of kilometers long, the Hallandsas Ridge is prominent above the flat landscape of southwest Sweden. The TBM chosen was a special form of Henenknecht Mixshield named 'Asa' that can operate in open mode or closed slurry-shield mode. Grouting is necessary in many parts of the tunnels for water control, but only infrequently for the purposes of general ground consolidation, despite the broken rock.		grouting; railway construction; TBM; tunnel; tunneling; Scandinavia; Sweden							Jones, M.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Eastern areas of India's Andhra Pradesh state receive only 200mm of rainfall per year, an amount comparable to Africa's Kalahari Desert. Tunneling with three Robbins TBMs has been ongoing at the Pjimineti Madhava Reddy (AMR) and neighboring Pula Subbaiah Veligonda projects since 2008 and 2009, respectively. A combination of atypically hard rock, tunnel length, and jobsite location make the AMR and Veligonda tunnels among the most challenging projects in the country's history. Crews have overcome multiple obstacles including blocky ground, continual power outages, and a once-a-century monsoon. The three 10m diameter Robbins TBMs are identical, and are all designed to bore in the hard rock of India's Deccan Plateau. The bore paths behind all three TBMs are nearly straight, making powerful steel cable belt systems a good option. Initial conditions at the AMR outlet included intermittent power outages, which were supplemented by onsite generators, and unexpected geology.		hard rock; TBM; tunnel; tunneling; Andhra Pradesh; Deccan; India							Willis, D.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Planning for Line 2 of Ho Chi Minh City metro has revealed that it possess some major challenges for tunnel engineers. The planning will provide underway for huge infrastructure works that will give the city's population of over seven million a six line metro system and improved bus links. The greatest challenge for tunnelers is going to be faced on line 2 of the scheme, where the majority of the works are underground. The tunnel's proposed alignment is based on findings from a feasibility study carried out by German consultants Tewet in 2003, and updated in 2005. The horizontal alignment is quite constrained due to locations of the stations within the narrow streets typical to the area, and the need to avoid building foundations. The line remains underground on Truong Chinh past the end of the Tan Son Nhat airport runways, and then surfaces through an open cut transition area of around 23om just beyond Truong Chinh 1 station.		bus transport; infrastructure planning; metro system; tunneling; underground construction; Ho Chi Minh City; Viet Nam							Gritt, E.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The use of simple numerical models coupled with torsional springs to represent the joint stiffness will assist designers to predict the response of existing cast-iron linings during critical construction activities, when failure is most likely to occur. A more accurate prediction of distress, and where and when it is likely to manifest itself, allows proposals that may hitherto be considered unfeasible constructions. The in situ axial loads present in the cast iron lining prior to construction of new works is of paramount importance in the prediction of allowable levels of joint rotation. The advantage of undertaking numerical analysis is that the assumption of uniform elliptical distortion is eliminated; the distorted shape of the existing tunnel linings is better captured.		cut and cover; excavation; numerical model; stiffness; tunnel lining						Angus, H.T., (1976) Cast Iron: Physical and Engineering Properties, , Second Ed.

Direct excavation of a stable open face, where possible, offers operational flexibility, the ability to deal with varying strata, and economy, even if the potential high progress of full-face methods may have to be sacrificed. Flexibility also extends to the section profile being excavated since there is no restriction on shape or width, within the maximum working height of the equipment. Conventional earthmoving plant has long been used to excavate large-section faces in soft-to-medium but stable ground. Terex, which now owns specialist tunneling equipment manufacturer ITC, not only offers ITC breaker-equipped loaders, but also mini-excavators adapted to tunnel use. Crawler-chassis-mounted road headers were first developed as a form of continuous miner for driving development tunnels in soft-to-medium rock mining. An extension to the concept of flexibility is to remove the cutter heads from road headers and to attach them to more conventional excavators.									Jones, M.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Normet has also been strengthening its international coverage, particularly in tunneling. Exceptional development trends include more use of polymers. A specific extension of sprayed concrete lining (SCL) is the CombiShell lining developed by Miller Tunneling and Beton u Monierbau. Shotcrete 513 help builders achieve 5MPa compressive strength at 15 minutes with 65MPa at 28 days. Natural Cement Distribution generally recommends the Lancy Tubaflow shotcrete equipment and, when shotcrete reinforcement is required, Bekaert Dramix steel fibers to increase tensile strength. Normet's build-up over recent years produced its best ever sales year in 2008 and is well positioned technically and logistically to serve tunneling more widely.		compressive strength; concrete; conference proceeding; cost-benefit analysis; efficiency measurement; polymer; shotcrete; tensile strength; tunnel lining; tunneling; underground construction							Jones, M.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The load-deflection response of cast iron can be idealized as liner-elastic with failure occurring through brittle fracture. The complete ring of a bolted segmental lining comprises a number of individual segments and a smaller key segment used to lock the ring in place during construction. A cast-iron flexible lining embodies the expanded ring principle of erection, designed for use in conjunction with a suitable shield. Crack initiation further reduces the bending stiffness at the joint thereby increasing rotation at the joint, tension in the bolts, and hence bending stresses in the end plate. Axial fortes and hence compressive stresses are transmitted in the hoop direction through the flanges or the skin.		brittle fracture; compressive strength; construction method; crack propagation; excavation; failure analysis; railway construction; stiffness; tunnel design; tunnel lining; tunneling; England; London [England]; United Kingdom							Bedi, A.; Mott MacDonald and Imperial College, London, United Kingdom								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Newly developed polymer-modified sprayed concretes help repair existing tunnels at lower costs. Sprayed concrete is a construction material of major importance, and its technical requirements are high. The polymer-modified sprayed concrete adheres excellently, even to difficult substrates like wet tunnel walls and has an improved carbon dioxide resistance. Wacker's application labs for construction materials in Burhausen, Germany, conducted development tests. The first development tests were designed to determine the amount of polymer that reduces sprayed concrete rebound and still provides the desired concrete properties. The construction of a new, 905m-long access route in 2007 allowed standard road trucks to pass through the tunnel. During the construction work the underground construction workers had to penetrate the impermeable layers above and below the rock. Polymer-modified concrete possesses valuable potential, both technical and commercial. The additional costs of modifying the sprayed-concrete are offset by the time and material saved, and converted into profits.		concrete; construction material; polymer; profitability; support structure; sustainability; sustainable development; tunnel design; tunnel lining; tunnel repair; underground construction; Germany							Bonin, K.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The Robbins EPB machine with 10.2 m diameter will be fully assembled at the 250-m long section of Ermita lztapalapa Avenue, a main thoroughfare in the center of Mexico City. The TBM will excavate sections of the Mexican Federal District's first new metro line in ten years, traveling between the southern neighborhoods of TIáhuac and Mixcoac. Tunnel cover is shallow, ranging from just 7.5 m at the launch site to about 14 m between stations. The machine build was accomplished in about ten weeks using Onsite First Time Assembly (OFTA). The Robbins machine was engineered for changing ground conditions, with a soft ground cutterhead, variable frequency drives, convertible muck removal system, and two-stage, ribbon type screw conveyor to handle large boulders and high groundwater levels. Boulders will be disposed of through an initial 1,200 mm diameter ribbon-type screw conveyor.		construction method; ground conditions; railway construction; TBM; tunnel design; tunnel lining; tunneling; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico [North America]; Mexico City							Willis, D.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Adrian Greeman focuses on the challenges that engineers faced while constructing bypass tunnel on the scenic California coast having to avoid the Devil's Slide landslide area on the famous scenic Highway One route. The Devil's Slide name refers to a rocky peninsula and also a short 180m stretch of the highway, though the project will by-pass roughly 5km of the existing road. The proposed new tunnel-route included a 1 250m-long, dual-bore tunnel with a bridge at the northern end, 300m long to leap a final valley. Road approaches of 460m and 305m at the ends complete the link. These have some high retaining-walls with a good area of soil nailed structure. Geology of the region is fairly young and heavily disturbed by the tectonic activity of the region. The tunnel site lays between the well-known San Andreas Fault system east on the San Francisco peninsula and the Seal Cove fault.		bypass; construction method; geological survey; ground conditions; retaining wall; soil reinforcement; tectonic setting; tunnel design; tunneling; California; United States							Greeman, A.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Tutor-Saliba is planning to excavate the 1,033m long tunnel tube through weak, sedimentary rock after winning the $2 14.8M contract to build the fourth bore of the Caldecott Tunnel. Situated in the Bay area of San Francisco, on the border of Alameda and Contra Costa Counties, the Caldecott Tunnel was opened in the 1930s as a twin-bore route. Commuter traffic to and from the Bay area is effectively throttled with the eight lanes of the SR24 reduced to six at the Caldecott Tunnel. Tutor-Saliba submitted the lowest of four bids, which were opened in September. The proximity of neighbours prevented drill and blast during night shifts and much of the day, and traffic flows in live tunnels also restrict the windows of opportunity. Excavation support will mainly be with shotcrete, rock bolts and ribs. Following installation of a waterproof liner a further layer of shotcrete will be placed.		bolt; construction method; drill and blast; ground conditions; road construction; sedimentary structure; shotcrete; support structure; tunnel design; tunnel lining; waterproofing; California; San Francisco Bay; United States							Reynolds, P.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Newcastle's $202 million New Tyne Crossing project involves the construction of a second vehicle tunnel to dual the existing A19 under the River Tyne in UK. Owners, the Tyne and Wear Integrated Transport Authority (TWITA), opted for a public private partnership structure to develop the scheme and appointed the TT2 consortium in 2007 for a 30-year concession period. The 318m-long north section relies mostly on cut-and-cover techniques. The 840m-long south section is also being constructed using cut-and-cover methods, apart from two small-sections of 32m and 40m which are being constructed using sprayed concrete-lining in order to avoid major utility diversions. The north and south sections are joined to the central immersed tunnel section by two transition structures, which act like coffer dams, creating a dry space within which to prepare the connection between the two types of tunnel. Each tunnel element is around 90m long, 15m wide and 8.5m high.		concrete; construction method; cut and cover; public-private partnership; tunnel design; tunnel lining; tunneling; England; Newcastle upon Tyne [England]; Tyne River; United Kingdom							Gritt, E.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The Belfast Sewers Project by Northern Ireland Water will provide Belfast with a modern sewerage system designed to manage its present and future needs. The project was designed by the Morgan Est-Farrens joint venture (JV). The tunnels were bored using a soft ground adapted EPBM (Earth Pressure Balance Machines), a machine that produced a predictable surface impact supplied by Lovat. The work was much more mechanized using High Angle Conveyor (HAC) in the 2.4m diameter section using a high altitude conveyor for the muck removal. The HAC proved a great success on this project coping with sandy soup, gravel, clay, sandstone and blocks of dolerite. Compressed air was used several times on the project, once for damage to the articulation in the 4m-diameter machine and once to a damaged screw in the 2.4m-diameter machine. The project was completed successfully despite tremendous variety and unreliability of the geology in the region.		boring; diabase; sandstone; sewer network; tunnel design; Belfast [Northern Ireland]; Northern Ireland; United Kingdom							Halls, L.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The Pir Panjal railway tunnel is the first major tunnel in India to be constructed using NATM (New Austrian Tunneling method). The tunnel is a part of the New Broad Gauge railway line of the Jammu-Kashmir Rail Link Project from Udhampur to Srinagar and Baramulla. The construction sequence was broken into two projects; the early works and the main tunnel works. The early works included the installation of the primary support of the adit, shaft and the 600m long soft ground section from the north portal. The Geoconsult-RITES (Rail India Technical and Economic Services) joint venture prepared these in separate packages so construction could start ahead of the main tunnel construction. After completion of the shaft cross passage and preparation for driving, excavation of the main tunnel towards the south started in July 2006.

There is a need to explore some ways of incorporating sustainable elements into underground construction projects. The sustainability 'triple bottom line' concept is one that incorporates economic growth, social responsibility, and environmental stewardship, while recognizing the interrelated and inter-dependent relationships for any new activity people can propose. Several sustainable options are being explored for underground construction for multiple benefits, including geothermal heating and cooling for buildings, small hydropower generation in water lines, and using heat collected in transportation tunnels to melt icy pavements at stations or roadways above. There is a wide range of elements that can be incorporated to provide sustainable solutions in terms of tunneling and deep excavation. A tunnel provides a constant temperature and sufficient space to allow for heat transfer, with proper planning and design.		heat transfer; hydroelectric power; motorway; pavement; power generation; tunnel design; tunneling; underground construction															0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Swiss Railways is increasing the capacity of Zurich's main train station by building a new railway line underneath the city, running between Alstetten and Oertikon. Opening in 2013, the double track railway, called the connection line, is being partially constructed by the consortium Weinbet Tunnel (ATW). ATW, which was contracted to build lot 3 of this major project, has contracted the design of supply and removal installations to Rowa Tunnelling Logistics AG under a turn-key arrangement. Designing the muck removal system required close cooperation with the client due to a range of challenging parameters. Transit traffic at the installation site Oerlikon had to be guaranteed at all times. Cramped local conditions as well as the need for a smooth integration of the different interfaces between installation site and Brunnenhof shaft presented challenges. Despite the challenges, Rowa was able to complete the project within the limited timeframe.		ground conditions; parameterization; railway construction; support; tunnel design; tunnel lining; tunneling; Switzerland															0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Shallow tunnels were the solution selected by Austrian Railways and the special Brenner Eisenbahn company (BEG) it set up to carry through the roughly €2.5bn project. Two long valley floor sections used Herrenknecht Hydroshields, and underwater excavation was done for cut and cover and assorted compressed air drives. Excavation was done within the ground tube using compressed air and conventional means. The existing line was then added using cut and cover methods to position it above and the remaining concrete structure completed. The soft ground, comprising alluvial and glacial deposits in terraces was excavated with extensive use of forward grouted tube roof support in a single layer and for some low overburden sections in double layer.		compressed air; concrete structure; grouting; railway construction; slurry; support; TBM; tunnel design; tunnel lining; tunneling; Austria															0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Jon Young discusses how Limerick Tunnel team handled the challenge of controlling concrete cracking on the crucial Southern Ring Road on the outskirts of limerick in Ireland. It is the key to building a watertight 675m immersed tube tunnel under the River Shannon without adding waterproofing. The onsite casting basin is the major piece of temporary works on any immersed tunnel project. The basin at Limerick was dug in line with the tunnel extending from the north end entrance some 560m. The basin was some 30m wide to give enough space to construct the 25.25m wide tunnel elements. A cofferdam wall made of Combi piles separated the south end of the casting basin from the Shannon. Following the first segment the team increased the cooling system to reduce cracking. During the flooding of the basin each tunnel element was weighed down with 2000 tonnes of water in the ballast tanks.		concrete structure; cracking; tunnel design; underground construction; Ireland; Shannon River															0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Confidence that a drive can be completed without downtime due to cutter changes removes a major worry from the project manager. The selection of cutters, and their arrangement on the cutter-head, is chiefly dictated by the expected ground conditions including not only the ground's hardness, measured as Uniaxial compressive Strength. Another factor greatly affecting the choice of cutters is the diameter of the tunnel and TBM. This is because the gauge and other outer cutters have to travel great distances while those nearer the Centrex travel less but are subject to higher axial loading and bearing forces. The development of small ring cutters for smaller diameter tunnel and micro-tunneling drives is continuing amongst specialist manufacturers. Bewarder of Germany offers a very wide range of cutters including static and ring cutter types for all standard BM types.		bearing capacity; cutting; ground conditions; loading; reliability analysis; rock mass response; TBM; tunneling															0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

At the highest level, the procurement of many major tunneling projects will be driven by factors such as governmental policy or the need to comply with regulatory developments. The detailed choice of procurement route, relating to the terms on which a contractor is selected and engaged, will fundamentally depend on the degree of project risk a client wishes the contractor to bear. The drafting of the detailed terms should reflect the desired risk allocation and management processes, rather than drive them.

The bench excavator has been changed to an electrically powered machine, while new diesel-powered face excavators conforming to EU Stage III emission standards have been purchased. The World Road Association (PLAJRC) published a report on 'Pollution by Nitrogen Dioxide in Road Tunnels' in 2000, which proposed a threshold limit of 1 ppm for nitrogen dioxide for healthy people. Mother solution to improving air quality in tunneling sites involves use of mobile filtration devices. Trailer-mounted electro-static precipitators can be driven into tunnels under construction.

The South Cobb Tunnel project is being carried out to meet the infrastructure improvement needs and growing wastewater demands of the South Cobb Water System, in Georgia. The project, which features a 6-mile long, 27ft diameter TBM bored tunnel, will eliminate 87,000ft of aging sewer lines and offer increased long-term conveyance capacity for the region. The joint venture of JF Shea and Trador Brothers is carrying out the excavation of the tunnel using a 27ft diameter Herrenknecht TBM at depths ranging from 150ft to 400ft. The Cobb County Water System (CCWS) requested bids from pre-qualified contractors for the project's main construction contract in December 2007. Shea/Traylor has advanced 4,940ft and is expecting to complete one mile. The majority of the tunnel is being supported using 10ft CT bolts and wire mesh. The last mile of the tunnel alignment may require the addition of steel rings to the immediate support.		excavation; infrastructure; TBM; tunnel design; wastewater; Georgia; United States							Foley, A.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

VMT has developed the 'Tunnel and Underground Information Software Structure' (TUnIS) that offers an advanced data exchange facility to facilitate integration of all common formats into a common database for smooth monitoring of excavation projects. The contractor and the client should agree at the start of any project as to what information shall be collected and who can access the information. A server forming the central part of the system is located at the site office, which is within a local area network and/or a broadband connection for VPN access. The 'Document Management' function allows collating and filing of information and notes. It offers digital filing of documents and is a support system for information exchange during the construction operation. Automated monitoring of parameters also saves time and facilitates the production and transmission of warnings and messages if required.									Remus, K.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn. Tunn.

Northern Ireland Water undertook the Belfast Sewers Project to build a new storm-water system in order to manage all of the excessive flows entering the old sewers, avoid the flooding, and direct the surplus rainwater down to the Belfast Waste Water Treatment Works. The scheme had to comply with the extensive criteria established in the EU's Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive. Atkins was appointed to undertake the project management for the delivery of the Belfast Sewers Project in July 2003. The key design considerations included the size, route and depth of the tunnel. The diameter of the tunnel sections were obtained from the hydraulic model which was developed by Atkins for the Belfast catchment. The model comprised over 40,000 nodes and 1,181km length of sewer pipes. Tunneling completed in September 2009 and handover of the project will take place in the New Year.		flooding; hydraulics; sewer network; stormwater; tunnel design; tunneling; Belfast [Northern Ireland]; Northern Ireland; United Kingdom							Skatas, A.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The project required research into seismic response as it was located in one of the most famous seismic regions in the world. The San Andreas fault runs roughly north-south to the west of San Jose and has a potential for a magnitude 8.0 seismic event. The project was to be designed to the BART Facilities Standard (BFS). The BFS had a number of provisos for segmental linings that tended to be appropriate for steel linings only. SC Solutions brought their expertise in dealing with seismic connections and structural analysis through 3D modeling of the effects on the lining using ADINA software.		dynamic response; earthquake engineering; earthquake magnitude; earthquake mechanism; fault zone; railway construction; San Andreas Fault; seismic design; seismic response; software; structural analysis; structural response; three-dimensional modeling; tunnel design; tunnel lining; California; San Francisco; San Jose [California]; Silicon Valley; United States						Biggart, A.R., Kramer, G.J.E., Walters, A.R., Owner procured tunnel machines (2005) A Discussion RETC Proceedings; Dean, A., Young, D., Kramer, G.J.E., (2006) The Use & Performance of Precast Concrete Tunnel Linings in Seismic Areas, , IAEG; Kramer, G.J.E., Sedarat, H., Kozak, A., Aliu, J., (2007) Seismic Response of Tunnel Linings, , Chai-RETC; Hashash, Y.M.A., Hook, J.J., Schmidt, B., Yao, J.I.-C., (2001) Seismic Design and Analysis of Underground Structures									0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The Ministry of Transport in the Netherlands commissioned a tentative study into the development of cracks in the concrete tunnel structure during fire. The study especially focused on the unexposed side of immersed tunnels, the locations where repair options are limited. A simplified computer model was used with a view to further qualifying and quantifying the gravity of the issue for typical immersed tunnels. The study concluded that although deformations during and after severe hydrocarbon fires, resulting from truck fires and dangerous goods transport, may be negligible. The test results conclude that the application of fire protection is an adequate means to limit and control crack width and number of cracks as well as deflections.		computer; cracking; deflection; deformation; safety; tunnel design						Fellinger, J.H.H., Reparability of immersed tunnels after fire exposure according to the RWS fire curve (in Dutch) (2007), 1, TNO report 2004-CVB-R0362Scholten, R.R., Breunese, A.J., Both, C., (2008) Investigation of concrete cracking due to fire in scaled immersed tunnel elements, Efectis report 2008-Efectis-R1046; Scholten, P.G.R., Breunese, A.J., Both, C., (2009) Investigation of concrete cracking due to fire in scaled immersed tunnel elements: Analysis of test results, Efectis report 2009-Efectis-R0358	Both, C.; Efectis NederlandNetherlands								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Skelhorn S., McNally L.	Practical precast ring selection	2009	Tunnels and Tunnelling International		DECEMBER		13	18			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-76849109338&partnerID=40&md5=d753772db0c1f70d37d68c08dc5512a0	McNally Construction Inc.	Skelhorn, S., McNally Construction Inc.; McNally, L., McNally Construction Inc.	Tunneling requires various support systems such as precast segmental liner rings to deal with challenging conditions. Designers and contractors started experimenting with trapezoidal segments in the early 1980s due to the need to improve water-tightness of the lining and the substitution of rubber gaskets for previously-used hydrophilic gaskets. The advancement in the systems over the course of several projects led to the development of the modem universal ring used today. Modern tapered segmental rings have mitigated many of the early issues, which usually comprise two trapezoidal key segments and numerous rhomboid side segments to make the full ring. Deciding the ring width is an important factor to consider when selecting the optimum ring configuration as tunneling is generally cyclic. The ring taper is generally determined by a combination of the tunnel alignment and width of ring. Modem universal rings make ring building simple compared to the early systems.		experimental design; tunnel design; tunnel lining; tunneling						British Transport Museum, , London England; London Under London - A Subterranean Guide, , Trench/Hillman	Skelhorn, S.; McNally Construction Inc.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The Ceneri adit tunnel and the Olmos TransAndean Tunnel projects have demonstrated how risks can be mitigated on deep bore projects, achieving higher efficiency with help from proper ground support coupled with attentive TBM machine designs. The 5.3m diameter machine was launched in March 2007 for sub-contractor Odebrecht Peru Ingenieria y Construccion, SAC (OPIC). The Robbins Main Beam TBM is boring the 13.9km long tunnel, which will transfer water from the Huancabamba River on the Eastern side of the Andes to drought-ridden areas on the Pacific Ocean Watershed. Despite tough ground conditions, TBM had entered sections of high cover up to 1,000m by 2008. The main adit for the Ceneri Base Tunnel was excavated under 600m of cover using a 9.7m diameter Robbins Main Beam TBM in 2008. The adit, located in Sigirino, Switzerland, will offer access to the site of the twin 15.4 km long Ceneri Base Tunnels.		excavation; ground conditions; mitigation; TBM; tunnel design; Switzerland							Willis, D.								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The Devil's Punchbowl stretch of the P3 was identified as requiring serious improvement works in 1983. Balfour Beatty employed Mott MacDonald as their Designers. Halcrow were subsequently given the task of category III checker. The existing P3 reduces from dual to single carriageway as it heads south just before reaching the Devil's Punchbowl feature. The scheme comprised twin 1.8km dual lane running tunnels with 16 cross passages. A number of suppliers were involved before the decision was made to adopt the solution proposed by VMT, AMBERG and BASE.

Alessandro Ferrari of Lombardi Engineering Ltd. focuses on passive fire protection being employed to protect Gotthard's cut-and-cover Bodio Section to ensure that tunnel remains in use at all times. The main consideration was to ensure safety of people and complete operation of the tunnel and minimization of the service interruption. The cut-and-cover section of Bodio began in 2000 and was accomplished two years later. It had two bores each of 400m in length and one cross-passage, which is located around 260m from the southern portal. A fire protection layer on the existing tunnel lining was needed on the whole length of the cut-and-cover section of Bodio. A cement based fire protection layer was considered to be the best solution for the section and the application of a layer of MEYCO Fireshield 1350 mortar was selected. The fire protection layer was applied on the concrete lining in both tunnel sections.		cut and cover; fire; safety; tunnel design; tunnel lining; tunneling; underground construction; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Gotthard Tunnel; Switzerland						AlpTransit Gotthard AGEngineering Joint-Venture Gotthard Base Tunnel South Lombard Engineering Ltd/Amberg Engineering Ltd,/Pöyry Infra LtdFischer Fixing Systems Walo Bertschinger AG									0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

A study was conducted to examine the fire behavior of immersed tunnels using numerical analysis based on a DIANA 9.3 model of the cross section of an immersed tunnel. A random triangular mesh of continuum elements was used to avoid preference of crack development connected to the orientation of the mesh elements. The model was validated by calculating the tested situations of the scaled tunnel segments. The crack width of 1.8 mm would leave the reinforcement directly exposed to the external environment. The 1:10 scale fire tests and the numerical modeling confirmed the development of large cracks with large crack widths at the unexposed side, even after cooling down. The parametric study suggested that the addition of fibers is not an adequate means to prevent or mitigate the problem. Preventive measures like passive insulation of the concrete or equivalent measures may need to be considered for existing tunnels.		cracking; immersed tunnel; numerical model; parameterization; tunnel design; tunneling; underground construction						Nieman, B., (2008) Cracking on the Unheated Side During a Fire in an Immersed Tunnel, , MSc thesis Delft University of Technology; Fellinger, J.H.H., Reparability of immersed tunnels after fire exposure according to the RWS fire curve (in Dutch) (2004) TNO Report, , CVB-R0362; Scholten, P.G.R., Breunese, A.J., Both, C., Investigation of concrete cracking due to fire in scaled immersed tunnel elements (2008) Efectis Report 2008-efectis-R1046; Scholten, R.G.R., Breunese, A.J., Both, C., Investigation of concrete cracking due to fire in scaled immersed tunnel elements: Analysis of test results (2009) Efectis Report 2009-efectis-R0358									0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

There are numerous macro-synthetic fibers available in the market, created from varied organic polymers and with differing geometries. Currently, the specified test of choice for sprayed fiber reinforced concrete (FRC) in civil engineering structures is the plate test as per the European Standard EN 14487-1, Sprayed Concrete, Definition, Specification and Conformity. The round determinate panel test, ASTM C1550-08, which measures the residual strength for deflections up to 40mm has been promoted by the macro-synthetic fiber industry. Extensive fire tests were carried out during the design stage of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) London tunnels on tunnel segments under loaded conditions.

The new EU directives and upcoming legislation decree stipulate that all the major existing road tunnels need to be upgraded to the latest safety requirements over the coming years. This will place higher demands on fire protection systems needed to fulfil not only fire protection and fire life safety needs but also offer the most economical and durable solutions for the given risks in the tunnel. Numerous bodies have started examining tunnel user safety and methods of protecting the structure from fire. Fiber manufacturers have promoted multi- and monofilament polypropylene fibers to contractors and design teams. Thermal barriers are designed to be installed as a protection to protect the structure from fire at any time. The MEYCO Fire Protection System, MEYCO Fireshield 1350, has recently been applied inside the Bodio section of the Gotthard Base Tunnel.

The Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) has recognized the risks involved with the aging Heroes Tunnel, Connecticut and arranged an inspection. The department called on CDM to inspect the tunnel to manage risk and financial implications of the necessary repairs. The department developed a multi-phase inspection and evaluation program, which involved review of existing data, followed by field studies to recognize tunnel features, constraints, and limitations that could impact the inspection process. Schedules were arranged with CTDOT and various inspection groups to identify available access times for inspections so that tunnel closures could be minimized to avoid impacting the traffic flow. Probable deficiencies in tunnel were recognized and a team involving geotechnical, structural, mechanical, and electrical engineers was brought together. A summary report containing the results, including the rehabilitation work suggestions and associated construction costs, is in progress.																	0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn. Tunn. Int.

There are various issues that need to be addressed when refurbishing ageing tunnel structures to increase their life expectancy and comply with higher national and international safety standards. The European Union Tunnel Safety Directive was approved in 2004 to meet the required norms on key routes by 2014 in most cases. Heavy goods traffic is a main factor in the safety ranking of tunnels even in the absence of identified unsafe loads. Material selection and identification of the properties of existing tunnel structures are very important in tunnel refurbishment for safety upgradation. Modern transport tunnel ventilation and its control require to be integrated with other emergency services like communications and alarms, shining signage for escape routes and fire-fighting systems. The Ekovent-developed 3K/SafeConstruction system of triple ceiling ducts and louvered extraction points facilitates incident intervention and exit to both directions from the fire center without requiring an additional escape tunnel.																	0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The first stage of construction of the Copenhagen Metro included boring two parallel tunnels with a combined length of about 16 km under the center of the city, of which around 14 km was to be bored using the two TBMs, earth pressure balanced machines. The potential consequences of a fire on the TBM were determined on the assumption that releases could be ignited, leading to a series of fire sizes and durations. The program determines the smoke temperature and velocity at various places down the tunnel and calculates the degree of mixing or dilution of the smoke. The mitigating impact of a water spray barrier on the TBM was determined using a separate program with modified fire parameters.

Ground conditions, use of provisional sums, and early use play important role while considering issues concerning tunnel project risks, leading to disputes. Unless the contractor is willing to take the full ground risk, every contract has a 'reasonably foreseeable' clause to define the level of ground risk the contractor is willing to take. The problem with this approach is that purchasers only want to pay for what actually take place, rather than pay a premium for a contingency which may not take place. Many disputes result from matters that are not related to civil engineering activities. Delay in projects also lead to disputes, putting the purchaser at risk of being in violation of third party interface agreements or other statutory duties, with the risk of fines unless the scheme can be used before completion. Disputes can be prevented through effective project planning at the start and also throughout its duration.

Proper construction methods and meticulous planning were used to complete the Hampton Pump Out Shaft Project (HPOS) project, which aims to ensure efficient supply from Hampton Advanced Water Treatment Works (AWTW). Mott MacDonald in conjunction with Thames Water designers developed the outline design. The connection tunnel from the HPOS to the Hampton New Shaft was designed and developed using a similar method to the Sprayed Concrete Lining (SCL) section of the HPOS. The final main piece of construction needed for the project was the pipejack tunnel spanning from the HPOS to Stilgoe House. The 40m long 1.83m ID pipejack tunnel was built from a small 6m ID makeshift shaft to a depth of some 15m, with a back shunt for the jacking rig. The secondary lining and waterproofing of the HPOS is now being done, and the project is slated to be completed at the end of February 2010.																	0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn. Tunn. Int.

The buried service network and pipeline industries can make use of various options available in the market to refurbish pipe systems to increase their lifespan, thus avoiding frequent digging. A UK company has launched a special jet cleaning unit called the Truck Main Cleaning system, which maximizes the cleaning potential. Flusher developed in the UK is a gate system which can be placed at any point in a pipeline and preset to retain flows upstream of the gate before reaching a specific level. Once cleaning is over, next step involves assessing any damage within the pipe and selecting a renovation option to provide the best refurbishment back to the required functional level. Some of the available curing techniques include Cured In Place Pipe (CIPP) and UV, steam, and ambient curing. Moreover, Glass Reinforced Plastic liners and spray lining can also be used to enhance the life expectancy of pipes.																	0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn. Tunn. Int.	Article	Scopus

Steel fibers have a high modulus and a high resistance in traction, which means they are not effective against cracks, while the synthetic fibers have a low Young modulus ranging between 3 and 5GPa and are reactive to potential cracks at an early stage. Conversely, synthetic fibers lose significance as the concrete becomes more mature. Steel fibers do not creep at the levels of strain in concrete, while it is not so with synthetic fibers. Durability of fiber reinforced concrete involves two aspects; the material and the structure. The first aspect concerns corrosion of the fibers, and there is no durability issue in the fiber in the concrete when it comes to synthetic fibers. Corrosion of the fibers may take place in case of steel fibers.									Rossi, P.; France's LCPC's (Laboratoire Centrale des Ponts et Chaussées)France								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn. Tunn.

The Icelandic road authority is trying to build a direct link between the two towns Siglufjördur and Ólafsfjördur so as to cut traveling time and to create better link through the mountains. The work of the tunnel aims to manage the water inflows through good geology with the most challenging section of 2km long downhill with the installation of automatic pumps to remove water from the face. Tunnel excavation was a systematic and repetitive process of drilling usually two 51mm diameter probe holes 25m to 32m into the face with a 6m overlap. The tunnel work was fitted with the semi-automatic system, TCAD that is used to measure the position and the direction of a drilling bit, using a laser beam for guidance.

The implementation of flat arch technology for the renovation of St Pancras Station for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) facilitated the gradual installation of frames to ensure minimal impact on the stability and integrity of the station tunnel rings. The lintel and sill beams were designed as flat arches to minimize the depth of the segment connections so as to eliminate tensile stresses as all the forces are resolved into compressive stresses. The segments were designed in Spheroidal Graphite Iron (SGI) and depended on the rigidity of the lateral elements and the installations were carried out in 52 hour weekend possessions. The deployment was found to be very successful in large tunnels especially with historical deformations and reduced capacity to tolerate further deformations due to excavation works and provided the benefits of structural system with resulting internal forces in pure compression.																	0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The preconstruction investigation of the project included boreholes every 260m along the tunnel's alignment, and reported the need of three types of ground support dependent on the ground conditions as S1, S2 and S3. The in-situ tunnel lining is critical to ensure the project's cost, where both primary and secondary lining use macro-synthetic fiber, Barchip Shogun as reinforcement in place of steel fiber. The expectation of completion of tunnel is for 30 linear meters per day to be poured allowing 10-14 hours setting, curing and pouring and 8-10 hours for concrete pour.		arable land; borehole; canal; dam; drought; infrastructure; irrigation; reinforcement; tunnel lining						EFNARC European Specification for Sprayed Concrete Aldershot 1996(2007), Guidance on the use of macro-synthetic fibre reinforced concrete Technical Report 65 The Concrete Society CamberleyRidout, A., The use of macro-synthetic fibre reinforcement in underground construction (2007) CONCRETE, 41 (3), pp. 39-41. , April; Bernard, E.S., (2008) Embrittlement of fibre reinforced shotcrete, Shotcrete; Bernard, E.S., (2004) Durability of cracked fibre reinforced shotcrete Shotcrete, , More Engineering Developments; Fibres for concrete - Part 2 Polymer Fibres-Definitions, Specifications and Conformity 28 I EN 14489-1	Camara, R.

The design of the completion of Cesana tunnel through asbestos-bearing rock needs to take into account three distinct factors, namely, the design of the tunneling method, the design of underground storage cavern, and the environmental impact study of the tunnel stretch with asbestos. The Piedmont Environmental protection Agency (ARPA Piemonte) ushered an analysis on air and rock samples using an electronic microscope to classify a high-risk zone for asbestos contamination. The project also adopted three different options for handling of the excavated material including the transportation to an existing waste disposal, on site treatment of the muck, and disposal of the muck in an underground deposit. A number of evaluations are also carried out on the project as geological and geochemical according to the Italian regulations.		asbestos; environmental impact; road; tunnel design; tunneling; waste disposal						A Olcese, A Guerini, G Gallingani, S Biagioni, G Ciaroni, A Nosetto, C Plisco, M e Bruzzone, S Figini, (2005).

The American Society of Civil Engineer's report for 2009 has proposed for more than $2 trillion investment in this sector by 2014. The industry appears to be center of innovation, wealth, and creativity stimulating economy requiring critical infrastructure such as tunnels. Urban tunneling systems such as BART, WMATA, and LA's Metrorail, releases bottlenecks whereas, rural tunnels such as LA's Inland Feeder Project protect environment. Tunneling industry requires meeting with challenges, vision and environmental stewardship in the grand attempt that the industry chase, instructing the next generation of tunnel. The tunneling industry and its institutions as servants are the best kind of leaders in hard times. The great efficiency of the private sector free market system in delivering tunnel projects must not be neglected in these challenging times.

The project uses latest TBM technology allowing the alignment to be lifted by around 20m resulting in a significant power saving and reducing carbon footprint of the project. The tunnel uses EPBM, which is capable of operating in open and closed modes and in lifting of alignment. Geotechnical Baseline Report (GBR) is also implemented by the company to manage and share tunneling risk. Higher alignment provides with green benefits such as less water pressure on the tunnel, lower leakage rates leading to saving in treatment costs, and reduced settlement potential. The project also offers social and cultural benefits that are associated with removing the existing sewer that is constructed above the high water level, and is visually intrusive and severs the bay.		project management; TBM; tunneling						H Asche, M Sheffield. 2008.

The online pipe replacement has been an increasing popular technique in recent years. This family of techniques that include pipe bursting, pipe eating, and pipe reaming have been reviewed. The pipe bursting technique was largely based around the use of hammers. Although effective, it has also certain drawbacks such as pipe material has to be relatively easy to fracture. Meanwhile, other technologies have been developed over the years to facilitate the replacement of pipelines. One of the technique was pipe eating that uses microtunnelling techniques. Furthermore, that microtunnelling has seen adaptation for use in the pipe replacement sector, so has Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD). The HDD rigs are set up at an access point atone end of the pipe being replaced, the drill is played out through the existing pipe.		drilling rig; horizontal drilling; pipe; tunneling															0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

These additives are used to condition spoil in the screw conveyor. A crucial component of EPB tunnelling applications is ground conditioning. Thus, in order to permit quantitative measurements of the conditioned ground behavior, it is necessary to develop and use a test able to simulate the extraction of earth from the chamber with a screw conveyor. This reliable test procedure can provide quantitative parameters that can really describe the conditioned soil behavior.		extraction; ground conditions; parameterization; quantitative analysis; reliability analysis; soil reinforcement; tunneling						Bezuijen, A., Schaminée, P.E.L., Simulation of the EPB-shield TBM in model tests with foam as additive (2001) Proc.

The segmental linings offer great potential for project success in terms of cost control and construction uniformity. In order to achieve success, the design of segmental linings should be highly influenced by site investigations and be uniform for long stretches of tunnel. The chosen design must be able to cope up with any range of ground conditions within the tunnel. Currently, many projects involving facilities for the local production of lining segments are led by manufacturers of the segment molds. These molds are designed and manufactured with the aid of 2D and 3D CAD/CAM software making the segments capable of forming a lining ring to the required tolerances.		computer aided design; ground conditions; software; three-dimensional modeling; tunnel design; tunneling; two-dimensional modeling; underground construction															0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Characterized by long length, high overburden, high groundwater pressure, and complex geology, the Access Tunnels are consisted of two parallel tunnels that are spaced 35m apart. Regarding the inflow problems, the largest water inflows experienced were a 7m 3/sec flow into the twin tunnels on the east side, with a judged maximum pressure of 4-5MPa and 3.4m 3/sec with maximum pressure of 6-7MPa in the west side tunnels. Addressing these issues, the water treatment strategy was offered to detect possible large water inflows ahead of the tunnel advance ensuring safe working and to try and avoid delays and extra costs. The methods in detecting water-bearing structures included geological forecasts, geophysical method, and drill holes.		groundwater; hydroelectric power plant; inflow; tunnel design; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East						Rock stability analysis, classification and support (2004) Norcosult Report, , No1, 2004, September; X Ren, T Li & X Chen, 2001.

Thus, a range of full-scale tests have been performed using a linear cutting machine at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM). In simulating full-scale rock cutting conditions, the Linear Cutting Machine (LCM) at the Earth Mechanics Institute of CSM is used. The LCM is proven effective in developing accurate performance estimates for different cutting tools. Laboratory tests performed on nine boulders included Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS), Brazilian Tensile Strength (BTS), static elastic constants tests, and triaxial shear tests. The summary test results concentrates on behavioural modes exhibited by boulders embedded in the stiffest and softest sand grout matrices in order to emphasize basic differences with respect to the behaviour of blocks embedded in matrix materials of significantly different strength and stiffness.		boulder; Brazilian test; compressive strength; shear test; TBM; tensile strength; triaxial test						Dowden, P.B., Robinson, R.A., Coping with Boulders in Soft Ground Tunneling (2001) Proc.

The new driverless subway line will be the longest in Europe when completed, with an overall length of over 44km. It will run across the city connecting Badalona and Santa Coloma de Gramanet, with Zona France and the airport, to the south-west. Based on the typology of the ground, the construction of the line is divided into four sections which involve the use of four tunnel boring machines (TBMs). The tunnel lining is consisted of pre-cast concrete segments. A deep tunnel alignment was selected to allow the alignment to pass below existing underground infrastructure and to reduce the risk of surface settlement as much as possible. A single large tunnel with a double-deck rail track configuration has been selected for the line to allow station platforms to be located within the running tunnel itself, limiting the surface disruption to access shafts in highly congested areas.		infrastructure; TBM; tunnel lining; underground construction; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Eurasia; Europe; Southern Europe; Spain						Della Valle, N., The Barcelona TBMs' Learning Curves (2005) T&TI, p. 26. , February; Della Valle, N., The new Line 9 of Barcelona Metro (2003) Proc.

The contractor for the project is Strabag. The project demonstrated that onsite first time assembly can save both time and money since it is the first instance of a new TBM construction method known as Onsite First Time Assembly (OFTA). This method permits TBM assembly onsite rather than in the facility where it is typically manufactured. OFTA is about eliminating pre-assembly operations and disassembly in workshops. This then results in fewer total man hours while saving time and costs associated with transportation as well.

Ground freezing is notable in that it is the only technology that can create both a watertight seal and provide load carrying capability. Ground freezing is basically about removing heat from the soil, and pored water is turn into ice. Stabilization is obtained since the resulting ice binds the soil particles and this results in strengthened soil. Another result is that freezing the soil makes the soil more stable and stiff.		ground freezing; ground improvement; sealing; soil reinforcement; soil strength						Newby, J., Gilbert, M., CDM, Maday, L., King County DNRP WTD (2006) Establishing Geotechnical Baseline Values for Deep Soft Ground Tunnels. 2006 North American Tunneling Conference, , January, Chicago, IL Proceedings; Hass, H., Consult, C.D.M., GmbH Bochum, Germany, 2006.

Naudts, A., ECO Grouting Specialists Ltd.	Grouting in soil or rock are done to stabilize the ground and to reduce the permeability of formation. Pre-excavation grouting (PEG) also reduces settlement, protects the infrastructure above the tunnel alignment and create a reinforced canopy above the tunnel trajectory. In soils, grouting is conducted by permeation and permeation together with hydro-fracturing. In rock, PEG is done by reducing water inflow. PEG in rocks is done mainly to strengthen the rock formation.		ground improvement; ground settlement; grouting; soil stabilization; soil strength						Hutchinson, M.T., (1989) Combined Grouting and Depressurizing for Water Control During Shaft Sinking: Shaft Engineering Conference, , Harrogate, England; Naudts, A., GFP Theory, ECO Grouting Specialists Ltd (1995) Report for MMSD; Naudts, A., (1994) Handbook on soil-grouting from the Practical Foundation Engineering Handbook, , McGraw Hill Publishing; Naudts, A., (2004) Contemporary Issues in Rock Grouting and Formulation of Engineered Cement Based Suspension Grouts: Caracterisation et traitement pour les ouvrages d'art, , Montreal; Lombardi, G., Deere, D., (1993) Grouting Design and Control using the GIN Principle, , International Water Power and Dam Construction; Heenan, N., Advanced Grouting Program at Penn Forst Dam Results in Reduced Construction Costs and High Quality Products.

The longest road tunnel in Australia will be built in Brisbane to relieve the traffic congestion within the city center. An identical tunnel boring machine (TBM) will be used which is 12.4m in diameter from Herrenknecht machines. This tunnel is a twin one which is 4.8km in length and will be connected to three level interchanges with a variety of bridges and ramps for it to be connected to the city's highway network. However, the project has a challenge in that it has to be finished quickly so as to alleviate the traffic in the city. Then, halfway along the project is the Kangaroo Point which needs a tunnel level interchange as well as ramp side tunnels and slip lanes.		capital city; TBM; tunnel; tunnel design; tunneling; underground construction; Australasia; Australia; Brisbane; Queensland															0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Any in-situ casting of tunnel linings, regardless of the project size, will need to take into consideration numerous factors like ground loading, water control measures, logistical interaction of plant and equipment, and cost and time schedule constraints. The collaboration among tunnel formwork manufacturers and suppliers and tunnel designers and contractors can help mitigate and/or meet some of these challenges. In addition to close relationship among personnel involve, the development of self-retracting and/or mobile forms reduces labor intensive operations and the automated vibration and concrete pumping systems minimizes the need for highly-experienced operatives. Three recent case histories have been presented showcasing the importance of partnerships between project teams and manufacturers: Austria's Kops II project's complex cavern concreting; self-retracting steel forms in Spain's twin-tube highway tunnels; and a rentable solution in Trondheim's highway tunnel.		ground conditions; tunnel design; tunnel lining; tunneling; underground construction															0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

An arbitration agreement involves the parties to take a case outside of the court and take it in private by a neutral third party. Arbitration is also more advantageous than litigation in that it has more control on the party over the proceedings. With this, one party has the option to choose a subject matter specialist arbitrator. Looking on the positive side of it, most jurisdictions in the world agrees on having an arbitration to settle such dispute rather than running it through a litigation. Arbitration agreement has terminology that is useful that it can be inserted into a contract at the outset. There are four layers of control within the conduct of arbitration which include the arbitration agreement, standard rules, control by arbitration and the arbitration law of the jurisdiction.																	0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

A congestion relief scheme will be done as part of the Victoria Station upgrade in London which will be having a sprayed concrete lining (SCL) tunnelling works and jet grouting. Grout forming will be done within most of the ground improvement works over the alignments of the new foot tunnels or Paid Area Link (PAL) with some regular cut-off walls. The solution to the congestion is to add additional access to the Victoria tube platform from the northern end. PAL tunnels will be placed at a level higher than that of Victoria Line station and London Clay for several reasons. The number of tube ticket halls at Victoria will increase due to this relief works while secant pile construction will be used to build the box stations in stages at both locations. However, River Terrace Deposits appears to be of concern for the tunnel works and for the cut and cover boxes. Dewatering will be used for ground treatment whereas the dimensions of most of the PAL tunnels excavation will be 6m high and 5.5m wide. A combination of shotcrete, mesh and lattice arches will be lined to the benched excavation. Finally, a design team will make sure of the constructability of the tunnels.		concrete structure; dewatering; ground improvement; grouting; pile; tunnel lining; tunneling; England; Eurasia; Europe; London [England]; United Kingdom; Western Europe															0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

As compared with earth pressure balance (EPB) machines, the Mixshield's use of a closed slurry circuit as the mucking system enables higher face pressures to be effectively dealt with. A Mixshield requires lower cutterhead torque compared with an EPB shield as the cutterhead is only excavating the ground at the tunnel face into the suspension-filled excavation chamber. Mixshield machines feature advanced wear detection systems for cutting tools and structure; positive ground support of the tunnel wall along the shield skin; advanced ground improvement scenarios for closed mode from within the machine; total integration of the whole package of above ground and underground measurement; approaching diameters of 18m to 20m; and fully variable, multimode concepts.		ground improvement; machinery; performance assessment; tunnel design; tunneling							Burger, W.; Herrenknecht AGGermany								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Solutions for convergency compatible systems in tunnels driven by shielded TBMs with subsequent segmental lining are still under development. One solution - the installation of deformable elements in the longitudinal joints - is unlikely to make its way from use in conventional tunnelling into mechanised tunnelling. Of the two other remaining solutions - ribbed segment with recess, or compressible filling of the annular gap - the latter is the more promising one. Its application will facilitate tunnel driving by TBM through sections of squeezing rock. Since this method provides higher advance rates than conventional methods of excavation and support its application will save cost and time. For huge projects like the Alpine base-tunnels in Austria, Italy and France and tunnels in Jurassic formations this could be of great importance.		support structure; TBM; tunnel lining; tunneling						Pacher, E., (1964) Deformationsmessung im Versuchsstollen als Mittel zur Erforschung des Gebirgsverhaltens und zur Bemessung des Ausbaues; Felsmech und Ing, , Geol, Suppl.

The Glyncastle Minewater Remediation Scheme is specifically designed to address the pollution problems regarding the Glyncastle coal mine. The scheme called on Longbore to do a directionally drilled bore design that will enable the interception and capture of contaminated mine water in the Neath Valley in South Wales. The Glyncastle colliery was abandoned and eventually the adits collapsed resulting in an accumulation of dissolved iron of up to 60mg/l within the mine water. Longbore thought of making use of horizontal directional drilling techniques to pull the plug out of the bath and to eliminate the mine water in a controllable manner. This design was then approved whereby Longbore was sub-contracted to complete the required drilling work and used American Augers DD-6 HDD rig as well as its associated equipment. The remediation scheme was of a success which was able to capture the contaminated mine waters and eliminated emanations from the diffuse discharge points. Due to its success, a United Kingdom Society of Trenchless Technology (UKSTT) New Installation - Small Project Award and an International Clean Up Innovation Award were both awarded to Longbore.		coal mine; drilling rig; horizontal drilling; iron; mine waste; remediation; water pollution; Eurasia; Europe; Neath Valley; South Wales; United Kingdom; Wales; Western Europe															0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The sealing of tunnels involves making them waterproof as well as reduce noise. The tunnels use structural concrete that is of low water absorbency, but there are other alternatives like mix ingredients and additives to better the concrete's inherent impermeability. One ingredient is Sika ViscoCrete range, which improve impermeability by reducing the possible water/cement ratio. Improvement in water impenetrability also involve pozzolanic materials and microsilica to reduce permeability to prevent aggressive agents from penetrating and attack the concrete and reinforcement as well as improving sulphate and chloride resistance.

Slurry generated from TBM use in Singapore show that the Code of Practice for tunneling rightly requires risk assessments to be carried out prior to tunneling. There have been a number of incidents of localized loss of ground. There has been the variation in ground conditions and the use of inefficient machines. There is therefore a need to review the geotechnical and topographic data available, recognize its reliability, assess the machinery obtainable and the workforce available, and evaluate the risks that may arise. A comprehensive contingency plan must be in place and practiced so they can be rapidly implemented if the need arises.		ground conditions; reliability analysis; risk assessment; slurry; TBM; tunneling; Asia; Eurasia; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Southeast Asia						Shirlaw, J.N., Rosser, J.C.W., Heslop, P.J.E., Immediate settlements due to tunnelling for the North East Line, Singapore (2002) Proceedings - Geotechncial Aspects of Underground Construction in Soft Ground, pp. 209-2114. , Toulouse, p; Shirlaw, J.N., Boone, S., The risk of very large settlements due to EPB tunnelling (2005) 12th Australian Tunnelling Conference, , Brisbane									0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

Hong Kong is set to spend huge investments in tunneling works. The tunneling projects will be used to expand the rail, road and drainage networks. The largest amount of money will be spent expanding Hong Kong's rail network, spiced up by the recent merger of the area's two rail companies, MTR Corporation and the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation. There are also plans for continuing long-delayed rail projects, including a new cross-harbor rail line, not to mention new road and drainage tunnels and a road tunnel under one of Hong Kong's shipping channels. The rail network there will be expanded by about 50km, the first of which is the project to extend the existing Island Line on Hong Kong Island. The extension will be entirely underground, and this will continue the Island Line to Kennedy Town. The biggest underground rail project is the Sha Tin to central Link and associated Kwun Tong Line extension. In the drainage sector, there are plans for the construction of the 11km Hong Kong west drainage tunnel. Highway projects include three road tunnels which are now at various stages of planning.		investment; railway construction; transportation planning; tunneling; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Hong Kong															0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

In cases where space is limited, high-tech conveyor systems are able to offer practical and flexible solutions to many of logistical issues surrounding construction. For example, vertical conveyors have been implemented on the UK's Lower Lea Valley Cable Tunnels. The site used high angle conveyors (HACs) to empty the side tipping muck skips at the site. Vertical conveyors can also be seen in use at the site on the East Side Access project in New York. The contractor is mucking its rock tunnel via a Robbins conveyor through the existing 63rd Street immersed tube tunnel. Users agree that conveyors can offer very smart solutions when shaft space is tight, especially for deeper shafts, as well as move muck around or off a site.																	0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The first use of tunnel boring machine (TBM) in Iceland is marked by the Karahnjukar hydropower project. The headrace and diversion tunnel have been excavated through varied volcanic and sedimentary rocks mostly by TBM with some drill and blast. The Jokulsa branch is almost completed after the excavation was finished in 2006. However, the view was that the available technical data on roughness of long water tunnels was incomplete and of limited reliability. A team drew upon methodology of wall roughness and hydraulic headloss studies that is based on visual inspection and laser measurement. The data obtained from these measurements were transformed from physical to hydraulic roughness, drawing upon three parameters: equivalent sand grain roughness; a friction factor; and a flow resistance coefficient. The research determined that the overall headloss from friction in te TBM-bored section of the headrace was 64m with a tolerance of 10%, which puts it at the lower end of the initial design estimate.		blasting; boring; drilling; surface roughness; TBM; tunnel; tunneling; underground construction; Eurasia; Europe; Iceland; Jokulsa a Fjollum; Northern Europe; Scandinavia							Reynolds, P., Kŕahnjúkar, Iceland								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

It has been argued that to defeat such a global approach it is simply necessary to defeat one of the grounds for all the others to then fall, put the other way, for the claimant to succeed in a claim with ten heads of claim relating to one lump of money. It is submitted that following the line of common law cases, such a view would not be safe. Some comfort can be taken by contractor claimants that the judicial tide is with them in terms of a reluctance to strike out claims at the first cry of global claim.																	0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

However, many problems arose since the existence in 1977, of which the disposal of ILW waste into shaft that formed part of the Liquid Effluent Discharge Tunnel (LEDT), created an explosion in the head space above the waste column. Some 11 years of the explosion, the long term strategy for Dounreay ILW Shaft was changed to Retrieval of Waste. This retrieval could be carried out as wet or dry retrieval, however, both required groundwater around the shaft to be controlled for the retrieval process. Addressing this issue, a grout curtain was agreed as a solution. Ritchies and Skansa were each awarded a contract to undertake the preliminary modeling and material selection. As of November 2007, the 20km drilling and grouting has been completed.		grouting; tunnel design; tunnel lining; waste disposal							Tiernan, A.; Ritchies								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.

The comparison trench excavation and microtunneling conducted in this analysis, it is showed that if indirect construction costs and social and environmental costs are considered, microtunneling is preferable to traditional trench excavation.		analytical hierarchy process; excavation; infrastructure planning; trench; tunnel design; tunneling						Bottero, M., Mondini, G., Towards the sustainability in mining wastes management: An application of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (2003) International Symposium on Industrial Minerals and Building Stones, , Istanbul, Turkey; Bottero, M., Peila, D., Microtunnelling or trench excavation: A comparison of the two alternatives (2005) International conference ITA-AITES, , Istanbul, Turkey; Gilchrist, A., Allouche, E.N., Quantifications of social costs associated with construction projects: State-of-the-art review (2005) Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology, 20 (1), pp. 89-104; Grillo, L., Alessandrini, F., Meriggi, R., A new system for the construction of large shallow tunnels by microtunelling technology (2000) Trenchlesss Technology, 15, pp. 43-58. , 1; Kramer, S.R., McDonald, W.J., Thomson, J., (1992) An introduction to trenchless technology, , Van Nosrtand Reinhold, New York; Maddison, D., Pearce, D., Johansson, O., Calthrop, E., Litman, T., Verhoef, E., (1996) The true cost of mad transport, Blueprint, , Earthscan, London; Nijkamp, P., Rietveld, P., Voogd, H., (1990) Multicriteria evaluation in physical planning, , North Holland Publ, Elsevier, Amsterdam; Saaty, T.L., (1980) The Analytic Hierarchy Process, , McGraw Hill, New York; Saaty, T.L., Vargas, L.G., (1990) The analytic hierarchy process series, , University of Pittsburg; Stein, D., Mollers, K., Bielecki, R., Microtunnelling (1989) Installation and Renewal, , Ernst and Sohn, Berlino; Sterling, R., Underground Technologies for Livable Cities (1997) Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology, 12 (4), pp. 479-490; Thomson, J., (1995) Pipejacking and microtunnelling, , Blackie Academic & Professional, London	Peila, D.; DITAG, Dept. of Land Environment and Geoengineering, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy								0041414X		TTINF			English	Tunn.
