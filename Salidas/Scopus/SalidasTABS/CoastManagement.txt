Maximum supply pressure of mineral resources in Hebei province, if you do not take effective measures, it is difficult to guarantee the support ability of mineral resources for economic development; there are also mineral resources matching pressure. For next 10 year, the contradiction between demand and supply of mineral resources is still prominent, two resources and two markets are the way to go in the future for Bohai urban agglomeration in the West Bank. Should be strictly in accordance with the Twelfth Five-Year Plan resource constraint index to deploy this area in the future for energy conservation and emission reduction work, make the development and utilization of mineral resources and economic development in the region coordinate as much as possible. © 2012 IEEE.	mineral resources; pressure; situation	Bohai Sea; Demand and supply; Economic development; Effective measures; Emission reduction; Hebei Province; Pressure situation; Resource Constraint; situation; Supply pressure; West coast; Agglomeration; Emission control; Industrial engineering; Information management; Innovation; Pressure; Mineral resources						(2010) 2010Year Bulletin of Mineral Resources in Hebei Province, , Department of land and resources in Hebei province; (2010) 2010Year Beijing Mineral Resources Bulletin, , Beijing Municipal Bureau of land and resources; (2010) 2010 Year Mineral Resources Bulletin, , InTianjin, Tianjin Municipal Bureau of land and resources; (2000) 2000Year Strategy Report of China's Sustainable Development, , Study group of the Chinese Academy of Sciences on Sustainable development, science press; Zhang, L., China's Mineral Resources Development and Regional Development, p. 1. , the Chinese petroleum industry press	Wang, D.; Shijiazhuang University of Economics, Shijiazhuang, China; email: wangdianru@126.com				2012 International Conference on Information Management, Innovation Management and Industrial Engineering, ICIII 2012	20 October 2012 through 21 October 2012	Sanya	94227		9781467319324		10.1109/ICIII.2012.6339746		English	Proc.

This paper analyses the contribution of the Coast Guard in optimisation of monitoring systems in the ecological and fisheries protection zone in view of the drawbacks of the existing sea fishing monitoring system. The existing monitoring system comprises the Fisheries Monitoring Centre with a developed data base and the Fishing Vessel Monitoring System. A SWOT analysis of the Coast Guard capability was made with the aim of improving the existing sea fishing monitoring system in the ecological and fisheries protection zone. The result indicates that the merging of the existing sea fishing monitoring system and the Coast Guard operational units would considerably improve the sea fishing monitoring system in the ecological and fisheries protection zone. Possible improvements of the system were found by comparing the existing sea fishing monitoring system and the proposed conceptual model of a sea fishing monitoring system in the ecological and fisheries protection zone.

Neighbourhood electric vehicles in mature suburbs	2012	26th Electric Vehicle Symposium 2012, EVS 2012	2			1396	1407			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84877630490&partnerID=40&md5=6db8b59a73b9b300369248bfd0c76c30	South Bay Cities Council of Grovernments, United States	Magadan, D., South Bay Cities Council of Grovernments, United States; Seimbab, W., South Bay Cities Council of Grovernments, United States	This is a Report on the first phase of a demonstration of Neighborhood Electric Vehicles (NEVs) in the South Bay Subregion of Los Angeles County. The project is sponsored by the South Bay Cities Council of Governments (SBCCOG) and funded by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD). Active use of the first demonstration phase began May 1, 2010 and ran for 18 months ending October 31,2011. This Report, based on the 18 months of data collection and analysis, aims to identify the positive role NEVs can play in addressing the following issues: Reducing green house gas emissions, criteria air pollutants, and consumption of fossil fuels by passenger vehicles and light trucks. Informing government plans and policies currently being formulated, including the 2012 Regional Transportation Plan, California Energy Commission's initiative for electric vehicle readiness, and the California Air Resources Board AB 118 vehicle voucher program. Implementing the Sustainable South Bay Strategy with its mobility initiative based on transitioning the gasoline fueled passenger vehicle fleet to some form of electric vehicle. Because this study is extremely data rich, a very detailed and scientific analysis has been completed for a somewhat small sample size of 29 participating households. From these findings it is clear that significant GHG and criteria air pollutant reductions could be achieved from wide spread use of NEVs for suburban residential driving. This research has also identified numerous market barriers that prevent wide spread adoption of NEVs as well as strategies to overcome market barriers such as production quality, speed limitations, and NEV prices.

The team consists of scientists, engineers, lawyers, and business managers from academia, private industry, and State of Texas government from the following institutions: (1) Gulf Coast Carbon Center at the Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG), (2) Det Norske Veritas (USA) Inc (DNV), (3) Wood Group Mustang and sister company Wood Group Kenny (Wood Group), (4) Texas General Land Office (GLO), (5) Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi (HRI), and (6) The University of Houston Law Center. Individual team members have expertise in carbon sequestration monitoring, CO2-pipeline design and construction, and domestic and international offshore environmental policy. The BMPs will be reviewed by external experts after it is generated and before being submitted to BOEM. The purpose of the BMPs will be to provide technical guidance to BOEM and BSEE (U.S. DOI Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement) to establish regulatory guidelines for offshore components of future U.S. Carbon Capture and Storage, which is sometimes referred to as sequestration, (CCS) industry. Sub-seabed geologic sequestration (GS) is the process whereby CO2 captured from large volume industrial sources (e.g., power plants, oil refineries) will be (1) compressed to supercritical state and transported via pipeline to offshore injection wells, and (2) injected into geologic strata deep (thousands of feet) below the seafloor. Objectives of the CO2 injection will be for 'pure sequestration' (i.e., long-term storage of CO2 in subseafloor saline reservoirs) or sequestration combined with enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Sub-seabed geologic sequestration is very different from ocean dumping (i.e. dissolution of CO2 into circulating seawater) or injection of CO2 into deep water, shallow sub-seabed sediments. Some researchers proposed in the past that shallow subseafloor depths (< 1,000 ft) were sufficient for permanent CO2 storage in deep marine environments (> 11,000 ft water depth) (e.g., House et al., 2006). However, the shallow sedimentary subseafloor environment could become unstable and allow release of CO2 into ocean water, the end result of which would be ocean dumping. One mechanism of seafloor instability could be the release of gas from hydrates owing to pressure and temperature perturbations that may be introduced by shallow drilling and CO2 injection. Furthermore, the logistics of transporting CO2 hundreds of miles offshore to areas with sufficient water depths for storage in shallow subsea sediments would probably not be economically feasible. We want to emphasize that subseabed GS of CO2 is not ocean dumping. One of the biggest concerns for onshore GS is the potential to impact shallow drinking water resources. Injecting CO2 deep below the seafloor will avoid this potential consequence. But there are sensitive marine environments of concern in offshore settings, protection of which is critical. Environmental monitoring of marine ecosystems (nearshore, along CO2 pipeline corridors, and outer continental shelf) and subseafloor geological strata in which CO2 will be injected will be a large component of the BMPs. Topics being included in the BMPs, a draft of which will be submitted to BOEM in June of 2013, are: (1) site selection and characterization, (2) risk analysis, (3) project planning and execution, (4) environmental monitoring, (5) mitigation, (6) inspection and auditing, (7) reporting requirements, (8) emergency response and contingency planning, (9) decommissioning and site closure, and (10) legal issues. Where possible, we are using existing regulatory, policy, and technical guidance documents as a starting point for the BMPs. We think the most likely location for initiation of U.S. offshore geologic sequestration of CO2 will be in the western or central sectors of the Gulf of Mexico where extensive offshore oil and gas infrastructure already exists. Academic members of our project team are actively working on criteria for site selection [1]. However, private industry is also assessing the feasibility of offshore geologic sequestration below the Atlantic seafloor [2]. © 2012 IEEE.

Morrison J.R., Pettigrew N.R., O'Donnell J., Runge J.A.	Rapid detection of climate scale environmental variability in the Gulf of Maine	2012	OCEANS 2012 MTS/IEEE: Harnessing the Power of the Ocean			 6405064					http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84873601977&partnerID=40&md5=01d5279d172958d72f615664d714af40	NERACOOS, Rye, NH, United States; University of Maine, United States; University of Connecticut, United States; University of Maine, Gulf of Maine Research Institute, United States	Morrison, J.R., NERACOOS, Rye, NH, United States; Pettigrew, N.R., University of Maine, United States; O'Donnell, J., University of Connecticut, United States; Runge, J.A., University of Maine, Gulf of Maine Research Institute, United States	The Gulf of Maine buoy array of the Northeastern Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems (NERACOOS) has been providing continuous oceanographic measurements for over a decade. NERACOOS is one of the eleven regional associations of the US Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). The buoys are deployed and maintained by the Physical Oceanography Group of the University of Maine, initially as part of the Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System. Analysis of this large timeseries (over 105 samples for a single depth) shows statistically significant warming trends at all depths for all locations, providing the first depth-resolved rates of temperature variability for the U.S. East Coast from continuous data. Analysis steps include quality control of the data, calculation and averaging of daily means and anomalies, according to the decorrelation timescale (∼ 20 days) and calculation of rates of change with linear regression. Use of the decorrelation timescale allows for optimal determination of errors by assessing the number of unique samples within the large dataset, in which observations are closely correlated to adjacent records. There are significant relationships between temperature variability and time (p&lt;0.05), and all rates of change are positive and significant (p&lt;0.05), although the temperature variability explained by time alone is low (average 12%). Warming rates are not consistent with depth; the greatest rates are observed mid water column at the deepest locations. Long-term historical time-series indicate that between 1940 and 1950 the Gulf of Maine warmed at approximately 0.25 °C yr-1, followed by over a decade of cooling at a similar rate, all superimposed on an overall warming trend of 0.01 °C yr-1. The period of rapid warming recorded by the NERACOOS buoys since 2004, of similar magnitude to the 1940-50 warming trend, may represent another cycle of decadal variability or perhaps indicate a shift in the long-term warming trend. If current warming trends continue, the Gulf of Maine ecosystem is projected to undergo a transition in species composition and food web structure. Direct effects of warming include changes in thermal habitat (affecting growth, molting and reproduction cycles) and species shifts in local spatial distribution and biogeographic range. While the transition states and their timing cannot be well predicted, the present understanding points to particular impacts on a number of important species that reside at the southern extent of their biogeographic range in the Gulf of Maine. The difficulty in prediction of ecosystem states and impacts reinforces the need to observe not only temperature and hydrographic characteristics, but also lower-level ecosystem productivity, diversity and abundance of key dominant species in the coastal zone, an area not well observed by current sampling strategies. Sustained high temporal frequency, fixed location time series are critical to detection of physical variability in as short a timeframe as possible. Without comparable sampling of ecological variability, we will not have the capacity for timely detection of ecosystem responses. Knowledge of the extent of change in the Gulf of Maine coastal ecosystem will contribute to informed decisions for adaptive management and development of Gulf of Maine ecosystem resources. © 2012 IEEE.

The capacity of efficiently putting in place proper activities allows improving the safety and security of maritime transport forecasting promptly dangerous situations, collisions and threats, such as crossing of the boats close to the coasts or bridges and carrying dangerous goods in protect areas; enhancing maritime traffic for increasing capacity of the harbours, the navigation efficiency, and routes utilization; and supporting the actors during the Search and Rescue phases. The proposed Vessel Traffic Management System attempts to reach the above aims enabling the cooperation decision making among all the actors involved in each activity. In particular, the solution lets on the one hand of sharing information among all actors, improving their situation awareness during all the operative phases, and on the other hand of making decision aids to the operators in both the planning of the mission and in tactical activities. The modularity and scalability gained from the solution architecture allow utilizing the VTMS solution in different and heterogeneous environments, such as national maritime territory, rivers, waterways, etc. © 2012 IEEE.	cooperative and distributed decision; monitoring and control; system of systems; vessel traffic management	Cooperation and coordination; Distributed decision; Distributed decision making; Heterogeneous environments; Monitoring and control; System of systems; Traffic management; Vessel Traffic Management Systems; Coastal zones; Decision support systems; Ports and harbors; Systems engineering; Waterway transportation; Decision making						(1997) Guidelines for Vessel Traffic Services, , Resolution A.857.20,1- IMO; Border, A., Vessel Traffic Systems, Year 1999 (1990) Proc. of Conf.

White Pass and Yukon Railway: Yukon's path to the pacific	2012	Proceedings, Annual Conference - Canadian Society for Civil Engineering	1			203	210			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84875520551&partnerID=40&md5=081c200fe7202140d0b6d1ea36f17a7c	AECOM, United States; City of Saskatoon, Canada	Johnson, K., AECOM, United States; Sexsmith, C., City of Saskatoon, Canada	The Yukon and White Pass Railway was the first major civil engineering project in North America north of the 60th latitude. Constructed in 27 months from 1898 to 1900, this 176 kilometre narrow gauge railway carried thousands of prospectors and their supplies to the Klondike Gold Rush from the Pacific Ocean. The railway provided the first efficient transportation link from the Port of Skagway, Alaska over the coast mountain range into the interior of the Yukon, and opened up the Yukon Territory to significant development by providing a major all-season transportation link for the territory for over 80 years. The railway also had an important role in the construction of the Alaska Highway, and the transport of ore from the Yukon mines to southern markets. The narrow gauge Yukon and White Pass Railway climbs almost 873 metres from sea level at the Port of Skagway to the White Pass summit in a distance of only 32 kilometres. This steep grade over the coast mountains was constructed with manual labour; the main equipment, aside from blasting powder, consisted of picks and shovels. The railway construction was maintained during the severe working conditions of a sub-arctic winter, and necessitated the development of construction techniques for permafrost areas, as well as cold region construction logistics and management.

RTLS performance enhancement through aggressive drag management	2012	AIAA SPACE Conference and Exposition 2012								http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84880965949&partnerID=40&md5=ba72d70bf7b2966355b162a2317bc6e7	Earth Space Applications, Inc, Space and Missile Division, Poway, CA, 92064, United States; Earth Space Applications, Inc, Poway, CA, 92064, United States; General Dynamics Advanced Launch System, Rohr Industries, United States	Hora, R.P., Earth Space Applications, Inc, Space and Missile Division, Poway, CA, 92064, United States; Westergren, D., Earth Space Applications, Inc, Poway, CA, 92064, United States, General Dynamics Advanced Launch System, Rohr Industries, United States	Studies have been performed over the last decade and more, evaluating the Hora-Westergren concept of deploying nearly 1G of drag to accomplish multiple goals. The deployment of drogue devices from a reusable booster, when staging, and remaining attached to those passive drag devices until the first stage booster returns to sufficiently dense atmosphere to commence a glide back towards the recovery site provides multiple benefits. The employment of a residual fuel burn - at low thrust and exhausted through the main nozzle - would provide supplemental propulsion (aka Rocket-Back) in the return glide and negate the otherwise significant base drag of the vehicle during that glide. Calculations will be presented to support the assertions that the result of this approach: 1.) minimizes the damage by plume impingement and potential aerodynamic instability during second stage separation by rapidly providing hundreds of feet of separation in seconds; 2.) passively abates the vertical and down-range coast of the booster vehicle after separation, while maintaining the orientation of the vehicle to the flight vector; 3.) returns the reusable first stage to sub sonic flows at altitudes in excess of 75,000 feet, thereby eliminating the classical reentry environments (experiences 2,000 fps at 90,000 feet); 4.) returns the vehicle to free gliding flight at altitudes above 40,000 feet; 5.) requires nothing more exotic than bare metal for all vehicle skins (a conventional super-sonic fighter could reenter; and 6.) requires nothing more than ordinary aircraft turn-around inspections and services to prepare the airframe for a new launch cycle. An additional benefit is that this concept ideally stages at about 180,000 feet and Mach 5.5. This is a higher altitude and Mach number than publicly disclosed for Rocket Back, and allows much more of the launch energies to be provided by the reusable stage, which will dramatically reduce the operating cost further. In all, this is a lower cost, lower risk and more rapidly cycled system than concepts without such complete passive and active drag management. The opportunity to optimize the reusable booster's aerodynamic design for sub sonic operation (no supersonic, endover- end, or backwards flight) will reduce the development cost as well. Further, this concept represents a low-development-cost opportunity for growth, not inherent in more complex, but lower performing designs. © 2012 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Using the vision of U.S. IOOS for coastal ocean observing, the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Ocean Observing System (GCOOS) Regional Association has begun a pilot project to build an integrated water quality network in southwest Florida that extends from the coastal ocean into the adjacent estuaries and rivers under tidal influence. The pilot consists of four phases: identification of federal and non-federal near real-time observing resources in the pilot area; development of data sharing practices with the area's participating data providers; and integration of the data sets and fusion of data types into products useful to a range of local, state, and federal stakeholders. If successful, the fourth phase of the pilot - expansion throughout the Gulf - will be pursued. The project will be adjusted and then expanded southward through the Florida Keys, northward to the Big Bend, and westward through the Florida panhandle to Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. Through data integration, the individual, single-purpose oceanographic systems will be combined in ways that will improve the decision-support information and tools necessary for coastal managers, communities, and others at the local, state, regional, and national levels. © 2012 IEEE.

Currently, over 130 HF radar units are providing coastal surface current maps to the public via the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (USIOOS): http://www.ioos.gov/hfradar/. These real-time data are used for Coast Guard Search and Rescue, Hazardous Materials Spills Response, Water Quality Monitoring, Monitoring Harmful Algal Blooms, Fisheries Management, Modeling, Marine Navigation, Ocean Energy Production. Techniques for improved, automated quality assurance of the data provided by coastal radar stations, such as the one discussed here, will improve the efficacy of efforts in these areas. Passing vessels provide a steady supply of targets for which the echoes in the HF Doppler spectra can be used as source signals. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) transmissions from these vessels provide the position and, therefore, bearing to the vessel. By associating the known AIS positions with HF Doppler echoes, a low-cost calibration procedure can be implemented which can reduce or eliminate more labor-intensive alternatives. This method is demonstrated using data from mid-range systems in the Santa Barbara channel that are operating in the 13 MHz band. A prototype package has been deployed on a system monitoring the Gulf of Farallones and the shipping lanes approaching the San Francisco Bay. Performance and data quality metrics for this prototype will be discussed. © 2012 IEEE.

The rapid growth of the oil industry in Angola was accompanied by a greater interest in environmental protection, specifically in areas of oil exploration and production operations. The Cabinda Gulf Oil Company - Chevron (CABGOC) - has implemented a successful environmental program to protect three endangered sea turtle species in its Angolan operational areas. The objective of the Malongo Sea Turtle Protection Program to mitigate the influence of the Malongo camp operations on the sea turtle nesting habitat of the olive ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea), leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), and green turtle (Chelonia mydas). The Health, Environment and Safety (HES) environmental team and a team of four surveyors (former Cabinda fishermen) used nest monitoring techniques and high-quality geographic information system (GIS) mapping capability to monitor the sea turtle nests in the 4 kilometers Malongo camp beach. Turtle monitoring included night patrols over a seven month period (September to April), counting nests, GIS mapping of all nests, relocating nests from areas of possible human disturbance, tagging and measuring sea turtles, monitoring hatching success, and releasing sea turtle hatchlings. Since its start in 2002, the program has registered over 1,000 nests, tagged and measured over 40 sea turtles, and released over 29,000 hatchlings to the sea. Additionally, a recent study of the Cabinda coast indicates that the Malongo program is currently the most successful sea turtle protection program in Cabinda in terms of nest hatching success, poaching protection, and documenting nesting patterns. This program has helped build partnerships with the community, oil industry partners, and the Environmental Ministry of Angola as well as increased public awareness on sea turtle protection.

Water is produced as a by-product of the CSG production process, with the management of this associated water (called CSG water) widely accepted as one of the industry's main challenges. The Australia Pacific Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project is a coal seam gas (CSG) to liquefied natural gas (LNG) joint venture between Origin, ConocoPhillips and Sinopec Group. The Australia Pacific LNG project proposes to supply CSG from the Walloons gas fields in south central Queensland to a LNG plant located on Curtis Island, off the coast of Gladstone, on the central Queensland coast. Origin is the upstream operator of the Australia Pacific LNG project (the Project). In the Walloons coal seams, CSG water keeps natural gas adsorbed as a thin film on the surface of the coal. The pressure of the surrounding body of CSG water allows the gas to be retained within the seam by adsorption to the surface of coal particles. Hence to extract gas the water pressure needs to be reduced by transferring the water to the surface. Water from CSG wells extracted to enable gas production is variable in quantity, difficult to predict and influences gas production rates. Variability in water production can be due to the location of the well, communication with other wells, decline in pressure during well life and permeability of the coal seam. The quality of the CSG water can vary from well to well and more noticeably across the project area, but it consistently contains elevated quantities of salts. Appropriate management of CSG water is required to mitigate environmental risks associated with untreated CSG water. Uses for such large and difficult-to-predict quantities of both treated and untreated water in the Walloons gas fields region are limited. As such, it is acknowledged that the treatment, use and disposal of CSG water present a challenge for the Project and the CSG industry in general. This paper will use the Talinga development area, established in 2008 and located southwest of Chinchilla in Queensland as a case study in water management adopted by Australia Pacific LNG. In particular, this paper focuses on the discharge of treated CSG water to surface watercourses (creeks/rivers) - one of a suite of water management options used by the Project. This paper explores the regulatory framework governing this aspect of water management and Origin's approach to ensuring the environmental values of receiving waters are preserved. At time of writing, the gas production from the Talinga field has been operated under an Environmental Authority (EA) with provision for an initial 18-month continuous discharge to the Condamine River of 20 ML/d as the preliminary water management option underpinning a broader management strategy. The broader strategy includes transitioning to a managed discharge flow regime that mimics the natural flows of the River.

The Mid-Atlantic Regional Association Coastal Ocean Observing System (MARACOOS) was established to coordinate the variety of oceanographic data collectors and information providers in an effort to leverage efforts across the region and enable the efficient development of meaningful information products and decision tools. Although MARACOOS partners have experienced numerous successes over the past 8 years, traditional aspects of the historical development of IOOS continue to challenge MARACOOS' ability to provide meaningful products. The imbalance between the push of the research community and the pull from the user community results in miscommunication and less effective product development. A structured approach is needed to enhance the user community 'pull' and move toward more effective and efficient product development. This structured approach could be realized through a stakeholder engagement infrastructure and process to strengthen user inputs into needs assessments and product design. A formal stakeholder engagement infrastructure will require investments that result in more focused product development and a stronger foundation for investments into new platforms and sensors, modeling, and data management. Ultimately, the result will be better information products that lead to better decisions that help save lives and livelihoods, and maintain the quality of life in the Mid-Atlantic Region. © 2012 IEEE.	applied data; applied research; coastal; coastal ocean observations; end user; forecasting; integrated ocean observing system; IOOS; MACOORA; MARACOOS; MARCOOS; Mid-Atlantic; observing; ocean; ocean observing; physical oceanographic data; product development; regional association; research to operations; stakeholder; user	applied data; Applied research; coastal; Coastal ocean; End users; Integrated ocean observing systems; IOOS; MACOORA; MARACOOS; MARCOOS; Mid-Atlantic; observing; ocean; Ocean observing; Oceanographic data; Regional associations; stakeholder; user; Forecasting; Information management; Investments; Oceanography; Product design; Research; Product development						Kuska, G.F., (2005) Collaboration Toward A More Integrated National Ocean Policy: Assessment of Several U.S. Federal Interagency Coordination Groups, , Ann Arbor, MI: UMI; Kuska, G.F., Thoroughgood, C.A., Moore, P., (2012) Enhancing Stakeholder Engagement: Toward Next-Generation Product Development in the R2O Process, , Washington, DC: IOOS Summit; Lanzerotti, L.J., Research to operations paired with operations to research (2011) SPACE WEATHER, 9, 1p. , S02003; Malone, T.C., Research to operations and back again (2006) MTS/IEEE Oceans 2006, , Boston, MA; (2000) Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, , Merriam-Webster.

Ganesha 10, Bandung, Indonesia	Jakarta is the capital of Indonesia and is home to approximately 10 million people on the coast of the Java Sea. The subsidence due to groundwater extraction, increased development, natural consolidation of soil and tectonics in Jakarta has been known since the early part of the 20th century. Evidence of land subsidence exists through monitoring with GPS, level surveys and preliminary InSAR investigations [1]. World Bank studies conservatively estimate land subsidence in Jakarta occurring at an average rate of 5 cm per year, and in some areas, over 1 meter was already observed. Recent studies of land subsidence found that while typical subsidence rates were 7.5-10 cm a year, in localized areas of North Jakarta subsidence in the range 15-25 cm a year was occurring, which if sustained, would result in them sinking to 4 to 5 meters below sea level by 2025. Land subsidence will require major interventions, including increased pumping, dikes and most likely introducing major infrastructure investment for sea defence [1]. With the increasing prevalence of Earth Observation (EO), the World Bank and the European Space Agency (ESA) have set up a partnership that aims at highlighting the potential of EO information to support the monitoring and management of World Bank projects. It in this framework that was defined the EOWorld projects [2]. Altamira Information, company specialized in ground motion monitoring, has managed one of those projects, focusing on the assessment of land subsidence in Jakarta. © 2012 SPIE.

Participants from federal, state, and local government use the task forces as a venue to share information and minimize potential conflicts between existing ocean uses and offshore wind farm construction and operations. Task force participants often only make information available in static map form, making comparisons between data sets challenging. To address this, the North and South Carolina Renewable Energy Task Forces are collaborating with the MarineCadastre.gov team to facilitate data sharing. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and BOEM have been collaborating since 2007 on MarineCadastre.gov, an integrated marine information system that provides jurisdictional, legal, physical, ecological, and ocean use data in a common geographic information system (GIS) framework. The MarineCadastre.gov website was developed in response to a call for a marine information system to support alternative energy development on the outer continental shelf in section 388 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Although the website has been designed specifically to support renewable energy siting within the U.S. outer continental shelf, it is also being used for various other ocean-related efforts. The MarineCadastre.gov website has three primary focus areas: Web map viewers and decision-support tools, a spatial data registry, and technical support and regional capacity building. The North and South Carolina Wind Energy Task Forces are combining national-scale data from the website with information specific to their planning areas into simple viewers available in the Map Gallery section of the website. This approach allows users to assess and minimize potential conflicts of offshore wind energy development and operation with existing ocean uses. Multiple issues, such as fishing, shipping, and defense, are viewed and considered simultaneously, in one location, allowing members of the task force to see their own data in a wider context. This enhances the utility of the information that was previously compared using static maps. Users can turn data layers on and off and pan and zoom to specific locations in the planning area as questions arise. The North and South Carolina Wind Energy Task Force data viewers are a simple but powerful mechanism for identifying areas of potential incompatibility, enhancing communication between task force members, and increasing the overall effectiveness of the task force process. The overarching goal of this work is to support the BOEM task forces in making sound decisions with the best available spatial information to facilitate responsible siting of offshore renewable energy infrastructure. This presentation will provide an overview of the primary focus areas of the MarineCadastre.gov project and its underlying technology, with particular attention given to the collaborations with the BOEM-led renewable energy task forces in North and South Carolina. Details on how these two BOEM task forces are incorporating use of the data viewers into their decision-making processes, the types of data being considered, and potential next steps for analyzing the spatial information in a group setting will be discussed. © 2012 IEEE.

With this accelerated growth in demand for gas, particularly with the onshore CSG production, comes the matter of the associated environmental affects and the need for socially responsible environmental management and mitigation of impacts. Why do I single out the CSG industry in this regard - after all the oil and gas industry has been the subject of considerable environmental regulation during the many decades of production in this country, and has a very proud record in doing the right thing. This paper relates specifically to one unique attribute associated with the production of CSG, namely the need to extract groundwater from the gas production wells in order that they be depressurised as a precursor to gas release. Pumping groundwater from of the coal seam 'aquifers' targeted for the resource reduces the hydraulic pressure to the point that the adsorption bonds holding the methane to the surfaces of the coal cleats (or microfractures) are reversed and the gas moves into the gaseous phase, and is hence available to flow to the well under the prevailing hydraulic gradients. Typically, a CSG well is pumped for its groundwater, producing its peak flows early in the life of the well, with flows of water tapering off with time, as gas flows increase and peak some years into its life. (Figure Presented) The consequence is, for a typical wellfield arrangement (of approximately 800 m by 800 m grid penetrations), considerable quantities of water are produced. We'll get to quantify this shortly. Copyright 2012, SPE/APPEA International Conference on Health, Safety, and Environment in Oil and Gas Exploration and Production.

Barco S.G., Lockhart G.G., Swingle W.M.	Using RADAR & AIS to investigate ship behavior in the Chesapeake Bay ocean approach off of Virginia, USA	2012	OCEANS 2012 MTS/IEEE: Harnessing the Power of the Ocean			 6404872					http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84873587566&partnerID=40&md5=12750261fc4784ef8fdf8eb7f9281f08	Research and Conservation Section, Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center Foundation, Virginia Beach, VA, United States	Barco, S.G., Research and Conservation Section, Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center Foundation, Virginia Beach, VA, United States; Lockhart, G.G., Research and Conservation Section, Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center Foundation, Virginia Beach, VA, United States; Swingle, W.M., Research and Conservation Section, Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center Foundation, Virginia Beach, VA, United States	We used a combination of AIS and RADAR to characterize large (≥ 65' long) vessel traffic in the Chesapeake Bay ocean approach along the US eastern seaboard from May 2008 through April 2009. During the 60 days of monthly surveys, we recorded over 2.6×106 records of data with ship position information. There were 1181 hours of AIS and 540 hours of RADAR data collected for a monthly mean of 98 and 45 hours for AIS and RADAR respectively. These data represented 1411 transits by vessels broadcasting AIS for a total of 69,606km of track line, and vessels acquired with RADAR represented a total of 506 transits for a total of 8,702km of track line. AIS and RADAR data resulted in 1.2 and 0.9 transits per hour respectively. We corrected the AIS data to match RADAR effort, and, when effort was equal, AIS data represented only 49.7% of the total large vessel transits observed, and transits per hour were equal for corrected AIS and RADAR data. We recorded more inbound vessels using AIS and more outbound vessels with RADAR. The density pattern of vessels recorded using AIS differed from the RADAR pattern. There was a very discrete pattern for vessels broadcasting an AIS signal that corresponded with the shipping lane buoys. Vessels recorded using RADAR, on the other hand, were more dispersed and displayed a less discrete pattern covering a large area outside of the ship buoys. Winter was the season with the fewest vessel transits for both data collection methods (23.8% AIS; 17.0% RADAR), though there was not a substantial decrease over other seasons in the AIS data. Spring, summer and fall were similar for AIS (24.2%, 25.7%, 26.3% respectively), but fall (31.4%) had considerably more vessels recorded by RADAR than spring and summer (26.5%, 25.1% respectively). When examining vessel type data, more than two thirds of the vessel transits recorded using AIS were cargo vessels (68%; n=337). Excluding unknown vessels, military vessels made up 47% (n=179) of the vessels we identified with RADAR, followed by fishing (32%; n=120) and federal law enforcement (USCG) vessels (10%, n=38). Spatial analysis was necessary to accurately evaluate ship speed over the entire study area. Spatial analyses of these data allowed us to examine speed behavior in a grid format, reducing the effect of directional bias from an overrepresentation of records from relatively slow moving vessels. Without utilizing spatial analysis, one could draw the conclusion that vessels were transiting the area more slowly than they actually were because AIS speed records are skewed by the greater number of speed points for slower vessels. There was an obvious reduction in speed of vessels transmitting AIS in the shipping lanes from before to after the Ship Strike Rule that was enacted in December 2008 to protect the western North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). The Ship Strike Rule identified a Seasonal Management Area (SMA) within which commercial ships ≥65 ft. in length were required to slow to 10kts or less for part of the year (50 CFR224.105). Although vessels slowed, many were not in compliance with the mandatory speed limit of the Rule. Speed restrictions had no effect on vessels observed using RADAR, most of which were not required to comply with the regulations. Cargo ships can be quite large and travel at speeds in excess of 20kt, and were required to broadcast AIS signals, so their behavior was relatively easy to assess. Few cargo vessels traveled 10kt or less for an entire transit through the SMA. Thus, we observed an apparent reaction to the speed restrictions in the SMA, but did not observe strict compliance. Recently the US Coast Guard has begun issuing speeding citations to vessels that have been recorded blatantly disregarding the speed restrictions in SMAs. We applaud these efforts and suspect that if the effort continues consistently it will encourage compliance. Our data suggest that AIS traffic levels were relatively constant (∼1.2 transits/hr) around the clock. For this project, we chose to operate the RADAR unit during daylight hours in order to assess vessel type and approximate length from the shore-based platform. In the future, we need to assess RADAR vessel traffic during all hours in order to better compare it to AIS traffic. In 2007, Virginia ports were listed as the third busiest port on the U.S. Atlantic coast for vessel calls. A large portion of the vessels calls for the port of Baltimore also enter at Chesapeake Bay. The addition of commercial Baltimore traffic as well as federal and fishing vessels not broadcasting AIS very likely makes the Chesapeake Bay approach one of the two busiest coastal port approaches and may make it the busiest in the western North Atlantic. This project raises numerous questions about vessel traffic patterns, vessel speeds, risks to whales and data incorporated into marine spatial planning efforts. There is a definite need for both longer-reaching ship RADAR data and more detailed whale presence data in the mid-Atlantic region, especially off its busiest port. Without data on whale presence, it is nearly impossible to answer questions about the level of risk that the vessel traffic patterns present for whales and on how installations of offshore wind and other energy ventures may affect whales and ships. This project brings into question the use of AIS data alone as an accurate representation of large vessel traffic in coastal regions of the United States, especially in areas with high fishing and military traffic. In Virginia, during daylight hours, AIS data represent a maximum of two thirds, and, as little as one half, of the large vessel (&gt;65 feet) traffic in the Chesapeake Bay approach. Further research is needed to address the accurate determination of vessel size when using RADAR. A mobile research platform with the capability of assessing RADAR targets on the water or an offshore platform with a greater range and use of night vision technology may provide solutions. © 2012 IEEE.

A need to improve the coastal oil spill response capability was therefore identified early in relation to the planning and development of the Goliat oil field, located in the south western part of the Barents Sea, and consequently a strategy was developed. Eni Norge and eni e&p joined forces to substantially contribute to the development of this strategy through the COSPIP JIP and a Memorandum of Understanding issued with Statoil, the only license partner in Goliat. More than 30 Research & Development projects were carried out in order to get new technologies and knowledge that could improve the coastal oil spill capability. This paper describes the comprehensive approach adopted in the JIP. Focus has been on coastal clean-up and protection, strategy development, equipment and software improvement, spill detection and monitoring technologies, logistics and local operations as well as on the study of behaviour of oil spilled in proximity of the coast. The main obtained results, which will be applied in the Goliat Oil Spill Preparedness, are presented. This paper also illustrates how the stakeholder management and the communication strategy were carried out successfully during the project, mainly through the participation at public meetings and the development of an oil spill preparedness website, with the aim to transfer the acquired knowledge by mean of articles and video presentation to local communities and general public. The paper is closely related to the SPE paper 156773-PP Implementation of the oil spill preparedness for the Goliat offshore oil field development - The first oil field development in the Barents Sea (1).

Mathewson A.	Show-stopper: Effectively managing project social risks; improved approaches to aboriginal engagement and consultation	2012	Proceedings of the Biennial International Pipeline Conference, IPC	1			275	281			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84882341604&partnerID=40&md5=112619a4761afd113b7047a92ee76482	AECOM, Burnaby BC, Canada	Mathewson, A., AECOM, Burnaby BC, Canada	A number of proposed pipelines in western and northern Canada have highlighted critical path social risks associated with effectively engaging and consulting with impacted Aboriginal rightsholders along pipeline rights-of-way. Opening up new markets for Canada's oil sands, shale and off-shore gas resources will require an expansion of the pipeline system in northern British Columbia, Alberta and the Northwest Territories. While navigating the regulatory approval process can be a formidable hurdle, a far greater challenge is how proponents manage the process of building relationships and consulting with affected Aboriginal communities. Failing to earn Aboriginal support for proposed projects can be a show-stopper. Exploration of new basins in Canada, driven by increased demand for energy in Asia, may compete with other land uses and constitutionally-protected rights and practices of indigenous peoples. Public, media and environmental response to new pipelines is often lead by the reaction of impacted communities. The task of identifying the social risks to a project, understanding the engagement process, fulfilling the regulatory consultation requirements of different jurisdictions, balancing impacts with benefits, managing issues and resolving disputes, communicating with the public and media effectively all require improved skills and approaches. The paper surveys the stakeholder engagement experience and differences in approaches for recently proposed major arctic gas and western oil pipeline projects, as well as pipelines to service Liquefied Natural Gas export facilities on the Pacific north coast, providing practical insights with possibly international application. Utilizing decision and risk analysis and scenario planning methodologies, applied to development of an Aboriginal engagement and consultation strategy, the paper examines how multi-billion dollar investments in new pipelines can be better secured by integrating stakeholder engagement into a project's risk management design. With greater precision and improved approaches proponents can effectively manage social risks, reduce stakeholder conflict and associate project uncertainties. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.

It is approved as an evacuation system by various regulators, including the US Coast Guard (USCG), and is currently operational in several marine cold regions as an EER and utility system. Following is a description of recent additional operational and ergonomical tests of the 52 Person USCG Approved ARKTOS Evacuation Craft. This description is followed by a summary of some of the ongoing developments for the system in oil spill control, ice management, and its extension to new applications in forestry and pipeline construction in swampy locations. As part of a reliability investigation of the ARKTOS EER capability, a series of non-Arctic calm condition manoeuvrability and performance drills were carried out to focus on both global performance and operator ergonomic factors. These tests were carried out at a temperate location in the Fraser River Delta and Robert's Bank, near Vancouver, B.C. Operation of the Craft in deep water with jets only, shallow water using both tracks and jets, and on tidal flats above water using tracks only. The planned utilization of the Craft by ENI Petroleum, Inc. in the Beaufort Sea is described. Next, descriptions of some other current new developments for oil spill cleanup, river and sea ice management, and disaster response applications are given. Conclusions and recommendations for further developments and reliability improvements are given. Copyright ©2012 ICETECH 12. All rights reserved.

Golf courses, ornamental, 'Atlantic' gardens and swimming pools are the most striking artefacts of this transformation, threatening the local water supply systems and exacerbating water scarcity. In the face of climate change, urban landscape irrigation is becoming increasingly important from a resource management point of view. This paper adopts urban remote sensing towards a targeted mapping approach using machine learning techniques and highresolution satellite imagery (WorldView-2) to generate GIS-ready information for urban water consumption studies. Swimming pools, vegetation and - as a subgroup of vegetation - turf grass are extracted as important determinants of water consumption. For image analysis, the complex nature of urban environments suggests spatial-spectral classification, i.e. the complementary use of the spectral signature and spatial descriptors. Multiscale image segmentation provides means to extract the spatial descriptors - namely object feature layers - which can be concatenated at pixel level to the spectral signature. This study assesses the value of object features using different machine learning techniques and amounts of labeled information for learning. The results indicate the benefit of the spatial-spectral approach if combined with appropriate classifiers like tree-based ensembles or support vector machines, which can handle high dimensionality. Finally, a Random Forest classifier was chosen to deliver the classified input data for the estimation of evaporative water loss and net landscape irrigation requirements. © 2012 SPIE.

The 2011 earthquake off the Pacific coast of Tohoku occurred at 14:46 Japan Standard Time on March 11. All the nuclear power plants in the Eastern Japan along with the Pacific Ocean coastline have successfully shutdown according to the earthquake ground motion. In 40 minutes, the first tsunami struck the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station. The tsunami height was 15 m at maximum which was far beyond the design tsunami height. It caused the submergence in seawater of the emergency power supply and seawater systems. It results in the station black out and loss of ultimate heat sink in the units 1-4 of the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station. To make the matter worse, hydrogen explosion in the reactor building took place, which has every effort for recovery all fail. Consequently the reactor cores were seriously damaged and the nuclear fuel melted which lead to the radioactive material release to the environment. Evidences currently available indicate no seismic structural failure of safety systems and components. The tsunami and the station blackout gave intense impact on the nuclear system resulting in the severe accident. In response to the lessons-learned from the Fukushima Dai-ichi NPS accident [2], the safety margins evaluation and safety enforcement of the nuclear power plants are necessary immediately. The nuclear system should have robustness for the beyond design basis conditions and resilience in case that the multiple levels of defense lines are deteriorated. Accordingly, the best performance in nuclear safety is to be achieved. The key for achieving the ultimate safety is of course the probabilistic risk assessment.

One major source of variability is the sea-land breeze circulation that occurs during periods of peak energy demand. The sea breeze front, driven by the thermal difference between the warm land and relatively cooler ocean during hot summer afternoons, propagates inland and under weak atmospheric boundary layer wind conditions can affect much of the state. However, little is known about the offshore component of the sea breeze circulation. A large zone of subsidence over the coastal ocean, and subsequent divergence near the surface, is known to occur in unison with the inland-propagating sea breeze front. RU-COOL's unique monitoring and modeling endeavors are focused on exploring the details of these offshore dynamics of the sea breeze circulation and its development during both coastal upwelling and non-upwelling events. A case study from the August 13, 2012 is analyzed in this paper; coastal upwelling resulted from persistent south to southeasterly winds for days. In addition, a sea breeze front formed in the afternoon, propagating inland and producing a zone of weak winds offshore that coincides with the targeted area of offshore wind development. Model results, using unique declouded satellite sea surface temperature data, are validated inshore against weather radar and offshore against coastal ocean radar (CODAR). Small-scale offshore wind variability is resolved and verified in the model, which will be critical for producing accurate and reliable offshore wind resource assessments and precise operational forecasts for the future. © 2012 IEEE.	air-sea interaction; atmospheric modeling; coastal processes; HF radar; Offshore wind; satellite SST; sea breeze; upwelling; weather radar; WRF	Air sea interactions; Atmospheric modeling; Coastal process; HF radars; Offshore winds; Satellite SST; Sea breeze; upwelling; WRF; Atmospheric temperature; Coastal engineering; Digital storage; Energy management; Meteorological radar; Wind power; Oceanography						Skamarock, W.C., Klemp, J.B., Dudhia, J., Gill, D.O., Barker, D.M., Wang, W., Powers, J.G., (2008) A Description of the Advanced Research WRF Version 3, 113p. , NCAR Technical Note TN-468+STR; Jedlovec, G., Lafontaine, F., Shafer, J., Rigney, M., Vazquez, J., Armstrong, E., Chin, M., (2010) Use of High Resolution SST Data for Operational Applications, , Ocean Science Workshop, Portland; Ekman, V.W., On the influence of the earth's rotation on ocean currents (1905) Arkiv.

The paper, based on the natural attribute of the coastal segments, constructs index system, determines coastal building stopping distance, classifies and grades the setback distances in order to facilitate management, applies it in Dalian, and at last draws the conclusion by concrete example comparison that coastal building stopping distance determined by the method is essentially consistent with the real distance between building and coastline, which can be regarded as the basis for coastal building planning and management. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

As a whole Chinese economy show that southeast coast is developed and western undeveloped relatively, the manufacturing sector also has such characteristics of the distribution. The distribution of energy and mineral resources which manufacturing need, has the opposite geographic distribution, western regions are more affluent than in the coastal areas. From the low energy consumption, low emissions, low-carbon economy perspective to see, the industrial layout characteristics of long-distance separation from such raw materials and production sites due to agglomeration economies, which will increase the transport distance of products and raw materials, which is not conducive to the economic low-carbon development; there is a need for macroeconomic adjustment. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

The geography and historic, linear development of its capital on the South Tawara atoll mean that many key public assets are at risk from impacts of coastal erosion and thus vulnerable to climate-change effects. An adaptation project started in 2003, which included developing a means of assessing coastal vulnerability and a process for proactive management of the coast. Guidelines offering alternatives to traditional coastal engineering methods were provided, and practical application of these guidelines was demonstrated at selected high-risk pilot sites in 2006-2010. Appropriate technology for increasing resilience was shown through application of simple but effective tools to identify and select adaptation options; recognition that customary responses ingrained over lifetimes will not be changed by a short-term project; and use of tried-and-tested quality improvements to traditional construction techniques. Rather than introducing completely new and unfamiliar measures, the pilot works enhanced and built on existing knowledge.

[No author name available]	Sophisticated modeling subsystem for Russian compressor station	2012	Pipeline and Gas Journal	239	11				1		http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84872972357&partnerID=40&md5=b0d11144b8eb764dc2e19f15e0726281			Wood Group Kenny company MSi Kenny was awarded a contract by Gazprom Avtomatizatsiya to provide a modeling subsystem for the Portovaya compressor station on the Russian coast of the Baltic Sea. The compressor station is part of the Gryazovets-Vyborg gas trunkline, which will improve gas supply in Russia's Northwest and feed gas to Europe via the Nord Stream pipeline. The modeling subsystem will comprise an engineering and operations simulator for offline simulation and a gas management system for monitoring and optimizing compressor station operations to meet operational requirements for the Nord Stream pipeline. The project will result in the most geographically extensive gas transmission simulation models ever implemented by MSi Kenny and will be based on an expanded version of the modeling software used by the Nord Stream pipeline. This will enable Gazprom to optimize compressor operations while achieving optimal pipeline inventory and operating conditions. The 366-Mw Portovaya compressor station will secure gas transmission across the 1200-km length of the Nord Stream pipeline and eliminates the need for additional compressor stations.																	00320188		PLGJA			English	Pipeline Gas J.

Laurderdale, FL, United States	On October 2, 2005, the New York State Certified Passenger vessel Ethan Allen heeled to port, capsized, and later sank as it rounded Cramer Point on Lake George. Tragically, 20 passengers died and several others were injured. A National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation ensued which focused on aspects of the intact stability and seakeeping characteristics of the vessel. This article includes a new examination of the NTSB's lightship determination and an interestingly fundamental analysis of the turn-induced heel and its impact on the resulting capsize. The accident has resulted in a renewed focus on how the stability of small passenger vessels is regulated. As a result, this paper specifically addresses two major findings, the increase in the weight of the average passenger and the lesser reported management of vessel modifications.

The data were consistent with an abbreviated form of the Protective-Action Decision Model in which female gender, official warning messages, hurricane experience, coastal location, and environmental and social cues were hypothesized to produce perceived storm characteristics, which in turn, would produce expected personal impacts. Finally, the latter, together with perceived evacuation impediments, would determine evacuation decisions and departure timing. However, there were fewer significant predictors of perceived storm characteristics and more significant predictors of expected personal impacts and evacuation decisions than hypothesized. Also contrary to hypothesis, female gender, perceived storm characteristics, official warnings, and hurricane experience predicted departure times. However, as expected, evacuation rates declined with distance from the coast; unlike Hurricane Rita 3 years earlier, there was a very low level of shadow evacuation in inland Harris County. Finally, most households evacuated 2 days before landfall, between the time of the National Hurricane Center hurricane watch and warning, and evacuated overwhelmingly during the daytime hours. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

It collects directional sea wave data, meteorological data, sea surface temperature and in some cases quality parameters. Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) and hyperspectral probes will be added in the future. The network will be also the main framework for tsunami wave study in the central Mediterranean Sea, and an early technological platform to study low-frequency sea motion detected in open sea using high-precision, multichannel, multisatellite GPS/Glonass/Galileo receivers and sea bottom instrumentation equipped with nano-resolution pressure sensors. © 2012 WIT Press.

Manto 84, LT-92294, Klaipeda, Lithuania	Coastal zone industrial activity as well as settlements development and attractiveness for tourism generate persistent coast waste contamination. Appropriate industrial and domestic waste management and utilization are essential for ensuring reduction of coastal zone environmental pollution. Furthermore, the waste effectively managed close to its source, could be used as a valuable resource for reuse, recycling or recovery of different types of energy. In this paper a review of waste as potential energy resource with the contribution to the reduction of carbon dioxide emission by creating a balance between energy consumption and sustainable use of resources in the Baltic Sea region is presented. Western Lithuania wastes compositions and properties, its moisture, nutrients, heavy metals concentrations, heat of combustion, total and organic carbon rate, and main chemical elements content for comprehensive further operation and environmental impact assessment are investigated. The results of evaluation of current and prospective waste utilization technologies, determined during REMOWE project included in the EU funded Baltic Sea Region Program, are shown. © 2012 IEEE.	coastal municipalities; composition and properties; waste management	Baltic sea; Carbon dioxide emissions; Coastal municipalities; Environmental pollutions; Heat of combustion; Industrial activities; Lithuania; Metals concentrations; Sustainable use; Carbon dioxide; Chemical elements; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Environmental impact assessments; Global warming; Heavy metals; Thermochemistry; Waste management; Coastal zones						Belous, O., Gulbinskas, S., Klaipeda Deep-sea port development (2008) Conflict Resolution in Coastal Zone Management, pp. 145-164. , ed.

The goal of the study is to identify the extent of inundation and shoreline changes along Vedaranyam from field observations and satellite data. Inundation distances were measured using Real-time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) and shoreline changes before and after tsunami were computed from IRS - LISS III satellite data. The field measurements suggest that the run up levels varied from 0.5m to 2.4 m. Agasthiyampalli village experienced farthest penetration of seawater when compared to other locations due to its gentle slope. Comparison of shoreline pre and post tsunami shows the extent of erosion of about 410m (inland) near Point Calimere tip. Coastal areas near mudfalts, salt marshes and lagoon were inundated extensively causing threat to the communities present near the coast, which emphasize careful planning of coastal zone development and management.

As a result of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami, approximately 23,000 Gg (23,000,000 t) of disaster debris was generated, with more than 12 million m3 of tsunami deposits left in the flooded area. The geotechnical utilization of the soil fraction in the disaster debris and tsunami deposits has presented a huge challenge to geotechnical engineers since (1) the clearance of debris and tsunami deposits is an urgent task which must be completed within a few years and (2) although a large amount of waste-mixed soil can be used in the construction of new embankments and levees to protect the coast from future tsunamis, their geotechnical properties have temporal and spatial variations. This paper summarizes the current status on the generation, clearance, and treatment and utilization of disaster debris and tsunami deposits from geotechnical and geo-environmental viewpoints. In addition, the environmental monitoring data on soil and groundwater quality conducted over the affected area is briefly reviewed. The results of several wide-area monitoring efforts conducted by different organizations indicate that no significant soil or groundwater contamination has occurred. However, the localized contamination near industrial plants where toxic chemicals leaked due to the earthquake and tsunami needs to be carefully taken into consideration during future revival and redevelopment works. Another serious geo-environmental issue is the management of the radioactive contamination of surface soils caused by the accident at the Fukushima First Nuclear Power Plant. This paper summarizes the distributions and expected behaviours of radioactive Caesium in soils and groundwater, and outlines the possible remediation options for dealing with this contamination. © 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

The washing plant includes an M2500 E4R mobile aggregate and sand washing system, AggMax 83R portable logwasher, aggregate screening and trash removal plant and a water management and recycling system, the AquaCycle A400. Material is first delivered to the M2500 and an overband magnet on the feed conveyor removes any ferrous material which is subsequently discharged to a skip. One of the major benefits of the ProGrade screen is the independent washing system which ensures it is entirely separated from the vibration of the screen minimizing the risk of plant failure. As material enters the integrated RotoMax RX8OR log- washer attrition is applied through synchronized rotation of the dual shafts which are fitted with highly wear resistant high cast chrome paddles mounted in a fan arrangement. As the sludge settles, the recycled water overflows the weir at the perimeter of the AquaCycle tank and is then re-circulated around the washing plant.

NOMOS consists of several subsystems: POMOS, Galata, Shkorpilovtci, BulSeaL and BulARGO. POMOS is an observing system located in the ports (14 measuring sites, 45 instruments, 14 weather and seastate parameters), designed to provide weather and sea state operational information for the areas of major Bulgarian ports (Varna, Burgas and Balchik), intended to secure safety shipping in ports, canals and bays. Galata is a platform which provides open sea Real-time meteorological and oceanographic information from 24 sensors, measuring 31 major oceanographic and meteorological parameters. Shkorpilovtci is a coastal oceanographic station compiling: weather station, sea level gauge, UV radiation sensor and Recording Doppler Current Profiler with wave sensor. BulSeaL is a network of sea level stations including four historical sites, measuring sea level from more than 80 years. BulARGO is a set of Argo floats deployed in the frame if the project supported by Bulgarian National Science Fund, Ministry of education, youth and science. The purpose of the BulARGO project is to develop a new national marine research infrastructure for in situ observation in Black Sea based on autonomous profiling floats as a Bulgarian component of the Euro Argo network. These subsystems collect real time data using various instruments and sensors placed at different strategic locations. All instruments are connected to communication system via intranet which provides direct access to the sensors. The measured data are transmitted to the central collecting system, where the information is processed and stored in database. Access to database is through internet/intranet with the help of browsers. Actual data is controlled by Data Management System an can be displayed on the computer screens using report server supporting thereby needs of different group of users. Next future development will be to install new system which includes five open sea moorings equipped with meteorological and oceanographic sensors as well as with seismometers as a main component of a marine hazards early warning system. The main goal of NOMOS is to support sustainable development of the Bulgarian Black Sea coast and EEZ, and the main task is to provide operational information for the needs of: national security, civil protection, Search and Rescue, government and local authorities, port authorities, shipping, marine industry, fishery and aquaculture, tourist industry, environmental protection, coast protection, oil spills combat and other interested. NOMOS real time data is one of the most important sources of multi-parameter operational information in the Black Sea which will serve for monitoring, verification and improvement of model results and forecasts as well as for collecting long time series of data needed for climatic research, marine physics, chemistry and biology. Free real time data access and developed user friendly WEB and WAP interfaces made the system useful not only for science, marine industry and governmental agencies but also for general public, especially for yachtsmen and windsurfers. © 2012 IEEE.

Reinforcement of surveillance system surrounding the hypo-central region in seafloor is essential to understanding the local seismicity and forecasting early warning information of seismic and associate tsunami event. A research and development project to realize the integrated management of large number of real-time seafloor observatories for earthquake and tsunami (named DONET) was planned and undertook from 2006. The DONET was designed and constructed to cover the hypo-central region of Tonankai earthquake and changeover to a normal operation mode from 2011. In addition to the operation of the DONET, the development of a new observatory network (DONET2) was started from 2010 to target to observe the hypo-central region of Nankai earthquake where is located the west of hypo-central region of Tonankai earthquake. This system aims to come into complete operation from 2015 and the surveillance network which fully covering western Japan will be maintained by this introduction. © 2012 IEEE.

Real-time current and wave measurements in ports and harbors using ADCP	2012	Program Book - OCEANS 2012 MTS/IEEE Yeosu: The Living Ocean and Coast - Diversity of Resources and Sustainable Activities			 6263642					http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84866705644&partnerID=40&md5=c91301114bc4965a51012b57fdcf078b	OceanTech Consulting, Potomac, MD, United States	Shih, H.H., OceanTech Consulting, Potomac, MD, United States	Both waves and currents rank highly by user groups among oceanographic observation variables. Real-time information of these variables is especially useful for vessel operators and recreational users in and around ports, harbors and bays. Other applications include coastal land management, ecosystem protection and restoration, mitigation of coast hazards and marine accidents, forecast, warning and search and rescue. The U.S. National Ocean Service (NOS) of NOAA maintains and operates a Physical Oceanography Real-Time System (PORTS®) in the Nation's major ports and harbors. Typical hydrological parameters measured include water levels, currents, conductivity, water temperature and depth. Wave information is of interest to PORTS® users, but has only been obtained recently in a few PORTS® sites. However, continued study and laboratory and field testing of various wave measurement instruments and real-time data telemetry technologies have been conducted since 2003. These instruments and technologies include Triaxys Directional Wave buoy, Directional Waverider buoy, and acoustic Doppler current profilers, underwater acoustic modem and links with radio and satellite. Extraction of non-directional wave information from near shore tide gauges (e.g., air acoustic gage and microwave radar altimeter) has also been studied. Among these, acoustic Doppler current profilers (or ADCP) are of particular interest since they are key instrument in PORTS® for current measurements. It is economically and functionally attractive to measure both currents and waves. This paper summarizes the NOS operational system and results of two NOS field studies of real-time ADCP systems for current and wave measurements in ports and harbors. The operational system includes bottom-mounted ADCP with buried cable in the navigation channel. Later, the system was replaced by a U.S. Coast Guard Aid-to-Navigation (ATON) buoy-mounted ADCP with telemetry radio. Shore based Horizontal ADCPs are also being used for real-time current measurement. The two studies (in 2003 and 2008) used different ADCP instruments and data telemetry techniques. The ADCPs used were RDI Workhorse series and AWAC (with internal processor). The underwater acoustic modems used were models UWM1000 and UWM2000H by LinkQuest. The data telemetry technologies used were FreeWave 900MHz spread spectrum line-of-sight radios, and Iridium satellite. © 2012 IEEE.

These events have also raised awareness of the need for risk assessment for local (e.g. submarine and subaerial landslide-generated) and near-field tsunamis (those that can impact a coastal community less than an hour after generation). Although existing tsunami warning systems such as DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis) are highly effective at providing an assessment and warning of far-field tsunami events, comparable systems do not currently exist for local and near-field events. Tsunami inundation models can predict coastal run-up yet the lack of wave amplitude, direction, and shape data within a few minutes of a near-field tsunami event limits the information needed for warning populations at risk. The Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) Observatory, combining the VENUS and NEPTUNE Canada cabled networks, is the world's largest regional ocean observation system with over 900 km of electro-optic cable. The ONC Observatory, located off the east and west coasts of Vancouver Island spans the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate and edge of the overriding North American plate, a region known to produce mega-thrust earthquakes. The ONC Observatory has an extensive tsunami monitoring system of bottom pressure recorders used to provide high resolution tsunami data for modeling far-field tsunamis in coastal regions [1]. Since the start-up of operations of the NEPTUNE Canada network in 2009, the capability of the system has already been proven by the high precision of the bottom pressure recorders that monitored the passage of the tsunami waves generated by the Samoan, Chilean, and Japanese earthquake events. The Observatory has an extensive sensor network covering a broad range of research themes and provides standardized connection ports for guest instruments. The system is supported by a sophisticated Data Management and Archiving System, which provides data acquisition, archiving, processing and visualization from sources across the Observatory. With the base core technologies and infrastructure for tsunami warning system research, the ONC Observatory is an ideal site for the test and evaluation of near-field tsunami detection technologies. This paper discusses how this unique infrastructure can be used to facilitate international collaboration, combining new technologies, concepts and algorithms to create an international near-field tsunami research facility to develop, evaluate, and test warning technologies and solutions for at-risk populations. © 2012 IEEE.	early warning system; NEPTUNE Canada; northeast Pacific; ocean observing; tsunami; VENUS	Early Warning System; Neptune; northeast Pacific; ocean observing; VENUS; Buildings; Data visualization; Earthquakes; Information management; International cooperation; Interplanetary flight; Observatories; Oceanography; Research; Sensor networks; Tsunamis						Thomson, R., Fine, I., Rabinovich, A., Mihály, S., Davis, E., Heesemann, M., Observation of the 2009 Samoa tsunami by the NEPTUNE Canada cabled observatory: Test data for an operational regional tsunami forecast model (2011) Geophysical Research Letters, 38, pp. L11701; (2011) Tsunami Warning and Preparedness: An Assessment of the U.S. Tsunami Program and the Nation's Preparedness Efforts, , National Research Council Washington, DC: The National Academies Press; Heezen, B.C., Ewing, M., Turbidity currents and submarine slumps, and the 1929 grand banks earthquake (1952) American Journal of Science, 250, pp. 849-873; Weiss, R., Fritz, H.M., Wünnemann, K., Hybrid modeling of the mega-tsunami runup in lituya bay after half a century (2009) Geophys.

This phenomenon is revealed violently and occasionally as gravitational movements of the ground and can cause material or human losses. Their prediction is difficult; however it is basic for the proper coastal management and the clear understanding of erosion risks. There are several models of the coastal cliff recession processes. From the stochastic type models based on historical erosion events, to the theoretical models as described by Eikonal or Boussinesq equations. In this work an intermediate solution is adopted (process-response model), such as models based on simplified balance of forces as trigger mechanisms involved in the erosion of the rocks. This model fits the marine dynamics: sea level changes, tidal range and wave transformation; along with the evolution of the land: the slope of the surf zone, erosion and rock falls. So far these models have been limited to small slope cliffs, since its numerical stability and the propagation of errors are unknowns. For these reasons, the development of a generic model that reproduces the spatial and temporal evolution of a cliff-2D profile (platform, beach and slope) consisting on semi-consolidated heterogeneous materials, is presented. In addition, the computational implementation, the study of different numerical resolution techniques and the produced errors, are also exposed and analysed. © 2010 CIMNE (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya).

As the development of urban modernization, people put great effort in building damming hydraulic project, promoting real estate development along the coastline, fish farming and so on. As result of this, the runoff of river downstream suffers from a sudden fall. When the tide rises, the seawater goes up along the river way and enters into inland, making the boundary of fresh water and seawater move inland. Along with the drought and over-exploit of underground water recent years, underground funnel group comes into being at different degree where water can not be immediately replenished, so as to accelerate the formation and expansion of underground funnels, resulting in much worse seawater intrusion condition. The necessary measures to relieve inwelling damage along the coast in Qinhuangdao is to manage coastal hydraulic engineering scientifically, to regulate underground mining correctly, to establish multiple water source channels, to increase effort in storing rainwater, to supply the underground water with rain, to recycle sewage, to desalinize seawater and to replenish fresh water aquifer in time.

Pontee N.I., Parsons A.P.	Adaptation as part of sustainable shoreline management in England and Wales	2012	Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Maritime Engineering	165	3		113	130		2	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84871076489&partnerID=40&md5=4470acb45ac22b411d22be72350c5003	Halcrow Group Ltd, Burderop Park, Swindon, United Kingdom; Halcrow, York, United Kingdom	Pontee, N.I., Halcrow Group Ltd, Burderop Park, Swindon, United Kingdom; Parsons, A.P., Halcrow, York, United Kingdom	This paper reviews the concept of adaptation within the shoreline management framework in England and Wales. In the future it may not be sustainable to continue to defend all the locations on the coast that presently benefit from defences. Adaptation can help deliver more sustainable shoreline management solutions that better manage the risks to the social, economic and environmental function of the coast. Planning for adaptation will require preparing coastal communities for future change and will involve building in flexibility rather than closing off future solutions. A number of case studies are presented which exemplify different aspects of adaptation. The paper demonstrates how future reviews of Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs) could promote more adaptive measures linked to the Coastal Change Management Areas that will feature in the next revision of land use plans. The future challenges to delivering more adaptive solutions are considered by looking at where adaptation may be needed, what more adaptive approaches may look like, and what the barriers to implementation are. One critical area is the greater engagement of local communities and the paper shows how the recent Coastal Pathfinder projects are tackling this issue. The lessons learned from these projects will be invaluable in rolling out adaptive solutions to other areas in the future. Such solutions can be progressed within the policies laid down in the current SMPs but should be updated in future SMP reviews as new information and knowledge becomes available.

Successful engagement requires a common understanding of 'adaptation' - a challenge when it may mean anything from an engineering intervention to a state of mind. This challenge is increased by the range of stakeholders whose involvement is essential - residents, statutory agencies and interest groups, but also visitors who support the coastal economy. The Jurassic Coast Pathfinder project has explored these and other issues with six diverse communities in Dorset and East Devon. All have one thing in common: if shoreline management plan policies are implemented, they will face significant changes in their social, economic and environmental fabric. Overcoming scepticism about the purpose of the project proved to be a significant hurdle at the outset. Having overcome this, developing ideas about how we might adapt proved relatively easy. Developing ideas which are affordable, deliverable and sustainable has proved more difficult.

To remedy the situation, the Gold Coast City Council (GCCC) formed the Hinze Dam Alliance (HDA) to design and deliver the Hinze Dam Stage 3 project (HDS3). The goal of the Stage 3 project was to reduce the impact of potential flooding in the Nerang River catchment and increase the dam's water storage capacity, ultimately improving security and reliability for the region's water supply. This required the dam wall to be raised from 93.5m to 108.15m. Two intake towers are located withm the reservoir to draw water from the storage to supply nearby water treatment plants. A seismic hazard study was conducted to confirm the design earthquake loads for the raised towers and the results of the study allowed for a reduction in the scope of work required, leading to significant cost savings.

One potential etiology to explain their symptoms included formaldehyde; however, formaldehyde levels in these occupied trailers were unknown. The objectives of our study were to identify formaldehyde levels in occupied trailers and to determine factors or characteristics of occupied trailers that could affect formaldehyde levels. A disproportionate random sample of 519 FEMA-supplied trailers was identified in Louisiana and Mississippi in November 2007. We collected and tested an air sample from each trailer for formaldehyde levels and administered a survey. Formaldehyde levels among all trailers in this study ranged from 3 parts per billion (ppb) to 590 ppb, with a geometric mean (GM) of 77 ppb [95% confidence interval (CI): 70-85; range: 3-590 ppb]. There were statistically significant differences in formaldehyde levels between trailer types (P < 0.01). The GM formaldehyde level was 81 ppb (95% CI: 72-92) among travel trailers (N = 360), 57 ppb (95% CI: 49-65) among mobile homes (N = 57), and 44 ppb (95% CI: 38-53) among park models (N = 44). Among travel trailers, formaldehyde levels varied significantly by brand. While formaldehyde levels varied by trailer type, all types tested had some levels ≥100 ppb. Published 2012.

In promoting an active learning environment and accommodating the various learning methods of our students, we are in need of engaging, hands-on tools for lecture and supplemental labs on renewable energy. To address this need, a multidisciplinary team of faculty members and students from the Engineering Technology programs in the college are participating in a collaborative research project involving cogeneration of renewable energy. The research project, Mobile Elemental Power Plant (MEPP), allows students to participate in a capstone project on cross-disciplinary teams, providing each of them a means to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and abilities in design, development, and fabrication of a final product. The overall MEPP team is comprised of twenty-three diverse students from four technology disciplines: Electronics Engineering Technology (EET), Design Graphics Engineering Technology (DGET), Mechanical Engineering Technology (MET), and Manufacturing Engineering Technology (MFET), under the auspices of four faculty advisors. The large group is broken down into five sub-teams with student representatives from each of the disciplines. The students are given the freedom to be innovative in their subsystem designs with the understanding that each independent design must be integrated into a fully operational system. The sub-teams are concerned with envelope, budget, time management, coordination of activities, and team dynamics. The sub-teams must also work together and function as one large team with a common goal. In the past, multidisciplinary engineering teams have been formed with little success due to differences in our program expectations for capstone projects. It was also difficult to provide faculty advisement and support across disciplines. The capstone process, learning outcomes, grading criteria and coursework vary between our programs. This research effort will give Engineering Technology faculty the opportunity to observe and to document the effectiveness of multidisciplinary engineering teams and to develop best practices for future multidisciplinary engineering projects. The outcomes of this study will help us to determine the viability of coordinating future multidisciplinary engineering projects through student assessment and to assist in setting common goals and creating guidelines for multidisciplinary capstone projects. A rubric will be used for assessment of student achievement in design reviews and project presentations. Student surveys will assist in evaluating the overall experience for students participating on a multidisciplinary project. They will be compared to student surveys from program specific projects. The outcomes and results of this multidisciplinary engineering project along with course goals and capstone project documentation will be documented and disseminated in the final paper March 2012. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.

Risk management decisions that are informed by and address decision maker and stakeholder risk perceptions and behavior are essential for effective risk management policy. A literature review and two expert models/mental models studies were undertaken to identify areas of importance in the flood risk management process for layperson, non-USACE-expert, and two USACE-expert groups. In characterizing and mapping stakeholder beliefs about risks in the literature onto current risk management practice, recommendations for accommodating and changing stakeholder perceptions of flood risks and their management are identified. Needs of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) flood preparedness and response program are discussed in the context of flood risk mental models. © 2012 Society for Risk Analysis.

The Informed Society: An Analysis of the Public's Information-Seeking Behavior Regarding Coastal Flood Risks	2012	Risk Analysis	32	8		1369	1381		2	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84865083735&partnerID=40&md5=3d89129ac00ed776f990e68521d23b0b	Department of Geography, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium	Kellens, W., Department of Geography, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium; Zaalberg, R., Department of Geography, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium; De Maeyer, P., Department of Geography, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium	Recent flood risk management puts an increasing emphasis on the public's risk perception and its preferences. It is now widely recognized that a better knowledge of the public's awareness and concern about risks is of vital importance to outline effective risk communication strategies. Models such as Risk Information Seeking and Processing address this evolution by considering the public's needs and its information-seeking behavior with regard to risk information. This study builds upon earlier information-seeking models and focuses on the empirical relationships between information-seeking behavior and the constructs of risk perception, perceived hazard knowledge, response efficacy, and information need in the context of coastal flood risks. Specific focus is given to the mediating role of information need in the model and to the differences in information-seeking behavior between permanent and temporary residents. By means of a structured on-line questionnaire, a cross-sectional survey was carried out in the city of Ostend, one of the most vulnerable places to coastal flooding on the Belgian coast. Three hundred thirteen respondents participated in the survey. Path analysis reveals that information need does not act as a mediator in contrast to risk perception and perceived knowledge. In addition, it is shown that risk perception and perceived hazard knowledge are higher for permanent than temporary residents, leading to increased information-seeking behavior among the former group. Implications for risk communication are discussed. © 2012 Society for Risk Analysis.

BBL operates the BBL pipeline, which can provide the UK with l5% of its total natural gas supply. The 36-in. export line transmits gas from Balgzand, near Den Helder, in The Netherlands, to Bacton Gas Terminal on the coast of Norfolk, England. The system extends 146 mi of which 140 mi is offshore. The system is of strategic importance for the supply of gas to the UK. IRM is supplying BBL with advice as to whether the pipeline operator would benefit from a range of both established and emerging repair methods. The company will also provide guidance on the best-in-class repair technologies available and the companies that provide them.																	00320188		PLGJA			English	Pipeline Gas J.	Note	Scopus

Space analogs are required as much as ever today as astronauts and scientists develop new tools and techniques for exploration, while working to address evolving mission objectives from low-earth orbit to deepspace exploration. This study examines coordinated human and robotic exploration at the Aquarius Underwater Habitat off of the coast of Key Largo, Florida, in support of the NEEMO 15 (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) program. The exploration scheme presented in this work fuses (1) robotic precursormissions as a means of remote sensing data collection; (2) crowdsourcing to process immense amounts of data to identify key targets of interest that might be missed in the tight cycle of mission operations; and (3) human exploration to examine locations directly up close and collect physical samples that require involved sampling techniques. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and single-person submersibles, called DeepWorkers™, were used as underwater analogs of robotic systems currently being used and human-operated vehicles (HOVs) proposed for use on a Near Earth Asteroid (NEA), the Moon, or Mars. In addition to operational lessons learned for space exploration that are directly applicable to ocean exploration, ocean floor mapping provides new levels of detail of benthic habitat critical for coral reef monitoring and management. Opportunistic (onsite adaptive) data sampling also took place by placing self-recording instrumentation onto each of the DeepWorkers, increasing the collection of scientific information during the submersible missions and contributing to mission planning for optimal and efficient use of expensive assets.

Tufts Ave., Denver, CO 80237, United States; Sprick, M.S., City of Portland Water Bureau: Operations Division, 2010 N. Interstate Ave., Portland, OR 97227, United States	Highway storm water runoff represents a significant source of dissolved copper to surface waters. It is well-established that even low concentrations of dissolved copper can be toxic to many aquatic organisms. In the Pacific Northwest of the United States, recent research has focused on the effects of low-level copper exposure to salmonids listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). In light of these recent studies, increasingly stringent guidelines for the discharge of highway storm water runoff have been imposed as part of ESA assessments of transportation projects. Assessing factors that may affect dissolved copper concentrations in storm water provides a practical framework for predicting when and where copper toxicity could be problematic. A storm water sampling effort was performed to examine the influence of site locale, traffic density, storm hydrology, the first-flush effect, and water quality parameters on measured dissolved copper concentrations in highway storm water runoff. In general, runoff from urban/high traffic sites and first-flush samples exhibited higher copper concentrations than other samples. Increased dissolved copper concentrations were highly correlated with both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and alkalinity. However, multiple linear regression modeling suggests that only the correlation with DOC has the potential to be causative. These findings will help inform state and federal transportation and environmental protection agencies regarding the conditions under which elevated copper concentrations and potential copper toxicity are most likely to occur. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Bream are demersal spawners, with the eggs laid in a nest excavated by the male as it creates a depression in a sandy gravel substrate. To build their nests, male bream expose bedrock and gravel by using their tails to remove the surface layer. The present study, using sidescan sonar and SCUBA diving, extends the known occurrence of extensive nesting grounds off the West Sussex coast to the Isle of Wight and Dorset. The nests are typically circular craters 1-2m wide, and 5-30cm in depth, which can clearly be seen using sidescan sonar as groups of circular depressions. Several thousands of eggs (1-2mm) are attached to bare rock in the centre of these structures. All the eggs hatch by July. The species is valuable and particularly vulnerable to exploitation by both sport and commercial fishermen during its nesting season. With no minimum landing size and no prescription for Total Allowable Catch or the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) stock assessment, they are suitable for protection under spatial planning measures, such as through the use of marine protected areas (MPAs).

Best practices should involve some form of monitoring prior to, during and post beach re-building. The most frequently applied monitoring techniques for Italian (and Mediterranean) beaches are topographic and bathymetric surveys carried out in regular time intervals in order to understand beach evolution. Morphological studies, based on grainsize profile analyses, can indicate the sedimentary evolution of the beach. In the present study, SCUBA diving techniques were employed in addition to traditional survey methods in order to monitor two study areas along the Ligurian coast (northwest Mediterranean Sea): Ospedaletti and Genova Vernazzola. In particular, a diver-operated, cost-effective coring system obtained marine sediment cores, and video transects and inspections generated information on the status of coastal defence structures (e.g. groynes). Using those methods, the main vertical discontinuities along the submarine beach were identified, as were points of erosion on the submarine parts of groynes. Such innovative techniques provided data that are not easily achievable with traditional monitoring techniques. Future monitoring programmes should consider these new methods as a way of improving assessment efficiency.

It receives runoff from a partially urbanised 55 km 2 catchment in which further development is planned. An Integrated Water Cycle Management (IWCM) strategy has been adopted by Wyong Council to protect the wetland by replicating the pre-development hydrological regime. To date the strategy has been based on the distributed collection, storage and harvesting of urban stormwater in a series of storage basins connected via a pipe network. The basin operations use storage, re-use and overflows to replicate pre-development flows. Funding constraints mean that the current scheme exceeds available financial resources. Here we describe further investigations, analysis and design that have been undertaken to achieve a cost-effective scheme that protects the Porters Creek wetland. It is concluded that the consolidation of a series of distributed storages and wetlands into a central regional storage and wetland would significantly reduce the cost of infrastructure and an associated reticulation network while still meeting environmental flow objectives.

A number of multi-billion-dollar projects are under development and creating massive demand for engineering skills in Australia, particularly those related to construction. The boom began in Western Australia, centered on production of liquefied natural gas, both on and offshore, and iron ore onshore. International oil company Chevron is leading two big LNG developments, Gorgon and Wheatstone, off Western Australia's north-west coast. What all these projects are seeking is primarily civil engineering and construction supervisory experience in concrete, earthworks, rail, road and marine elements of the construction process. Construction professionals from site engineer to project manager level and section foreman to works manager are needed. The Skills Expo usually covers all Australia's 100-plus priority skills list. In 2012, two of its four days were focused on recruiting engineers and trades primarily for projects in Western Australia and Queensland.

In order to solve this sort of geological disaster, scholars both home and abroad have been doing quite a large amount of work to find out the cause of the disaster and the methods of its prevention. Among all of these work, the research of Yantai seawater intrusion comprehensive governance is one of the most typical. We take Yantai for instance, studying both engineering and management measures of the prevention of seawater intrusion, while at the same time exploring and discussing the pattern of the prevention of seawater intrusion by integrating point, line and all the aspects comprehensively, which produces quite outstanding results. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

This earthquake exceeded by far the earthquake scale, tsunami height, and damage size that had been assumed conventionally by a specialty committee located in Japan's Central Disaster Prevention Council. To fill in the gap between earthquakes that had been assumed conventionally and the reality that was witnessed with their own eyes in this earthquake, trace investigations for gigantic earthquakes and tsunamis in old age are currently being carried out [18]. Under these circumstances, this paper focuses on the problem of unexpected disasters based on the viewpoint of Business Continuity Management (BCM), referring to survey results, which were immediately conducted among domestic companies after this earthquake. Characteristics of the problem of unexpected disasters are to have to solve two problems: how to assume unexpected events and the delay of current recoverable time that occurs as a result.

The subsequent multi-agency response was unprecedented in its scale and technical complexity, involving ∼ 48,000 people across 5 States and innovative techniques carried out for the first time in water depths of ≈ 5000 ft. The lessons from the incident investigation and response were used to enhance systems and capabilities, including enhanced technical requirements for well equipment and procedures, as well as measures to further strengthen contractor oversight; innovative capping, containment, and relief well techniques, together with relevant surveillance and monitoring for difficult and complex situations; and enhanced and extended capabilities in oil spill response and crisis management. BP is contributing knowledge and experience to the wider industry efforts to embed the learning, such as those through API, OGP/IPIECA, and OSPRAG. The new insights gained were also used to further enhance and accelerate change across the entire company, and to continue to build the top to bottom focus on safety and risk management.

CO 2 sequestration in deepwater sediments: Optimization and parametric studies	2012	Society of Petroleum Engineers - Carbon Management Technology Conference 2012	2			718	728			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84861011513&partnerID=40&md5=90963a55fc5d807f86c927624f5cfcb4	Blade Energy Partners, United States	Ghorbani, D., Blade Energy Partners, United States; Pilisi, N., Blade Energy Partners, United States; Vasantharajan, S., Blade Energy Partners, United States	CO 2 injection and storage in deepwater sediments under water depths greater than 9,000 feet (≈2,750 meters) where high pressures and low temperatures result in the CO 2 being denser than seawater and therefore being buoyantly trapped in the sediments pore-fluid, could provide an attractive sequestration option for countries and regions densely populated and emitting large quantities of anthropogenic CO 2 such as East and West Coasts of the United States of America, Japan, the East Coast of China and Western Europe. In these places, public opinion, government regulatory agencies, a lack of space for CO 2 injection sites and few depleted oil and gas fields available necessitate the application of alternative technologies to sequester CO 2 in order to mitigate a significant part of the 30 billion tons of CO 2 annually released in the Earth's atmosphere. This paper presents the results of multiple reservoir simulations and parametric studies for different types of deepwater sediments located in various regions of the globe (Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Japan Sea and Gulf of Mexico). Since not all regions and sediments deposited below 9,000 feet of ocean waters seem to be viable to permanently store CO 2, this study focuses on the critical parameters that need to be considered to successfully inject and permanently store liquid CO 2 in deepwater sub-seabed sediments. In fact, when injecting liquid CO 2 through an ultra-deepwater conduit (injection pressurized riser) within the first few hundreds of sediments, several uncertain variables such as temperature, sediment type, sediment thickness, permeability, porosity and CO 2 injectability greatly influence the overall integrity of the buoyant trap. Very long-time reservoir simulations (e.g. 250 years) have been used to assess the effects of different decision and uncertain variables on the behavior and the evolution of the CO 2 plume within the sediments. Also, experimental design and response surface methodologies have been used to quantify the risk associated with each of the critical parameters and to determine the optimal conditions for deepwater sediments CO 2 storage. Finally, the essential findings of the paper provide the offshore and carbon sequestration industries with a high-level mapping of the world's oceans and deep seas best candidates for CO 2 storage in deepwater sediments.

Current schemes require roughly a third of a power plant's energy for carbon dioxide capture and pressurization. The production of energy from geopressured aquifers has evolved as a separate, independent technology from the sequestration of carbon dioxide in deep, saline aquifers. A game-changing new idea is described here that combines the two technologies and adds another: dissolution of carbon dioxide into extracted brine which is then re-injected. A systematic investigation over a range of conditions was performed to explore the best strategy for the coupled process of CO 2 sequestration and energy production. Geological models of geopressured-geothermal aquifers were developed using available data from studies of Gulf Coast aquifers. These geological models were used to perform compositional reservoir simulations of realistic processes with coupled aquifer and wellbore models.

One of the main objectives of this study is to introduce an effective approach based on circular statistics for assessing the seasonality of the extreme precipitation. Circular statistics explicitly reflect the seasonal pattern of precipitation with maximum frequency of the timing of daily and monthly maximums. In southern Korea, a dominant frequency was identified in early July. The timing of the monthly maximum has been delayed in northern Korea. In the case of the daily maximum, the end of June is the period of most intense rainfall, with the exception of the east coast near Gangrung. A long-term temporal variation of timed monthly and daily maximums was investigated by a 30-year moving average for main stations. Monthly peak times of Seoul and Gangrung continuously moved backward while monthly peak times of Mokpo and Busan has moved forward since the 1960's. These features could be influenced by inherent variations in the East Asian monsoon system. Given the identified spatio-temporal pattern, this study was extended to characterize regional patterns of extreme rainfall over Korea. A new concept in regionalization procedures was developed on the basis of existing approaches that mainly utilize simple moments of data. In this study, the K-means method was incorporated with the temporal pattern of the extreme rainfalls in order to better characterize hydrologic patterns for regional frequency analysis. The results showed that the proposed approach is promising for the region in term improving the physical understanding of extreme rainfall. © 2012 International Association for Hydro-environment Engineering and Research, Asia Pacific Division.

Gravel barrier behaviour depends upon a number of factors such as sediment properties (porosity, permeability, grainsize), geological setting and wave climate. Since overwash processes are known to control short-term gravel barrier dynamics and long-term barrier migration, the development of a robust quantitative method to define the critical conditions leading to gravel barrier overwashing is important both for scientific and practical management purposes. It is known that when wave runup exceeds the barrier crest elevation, three outcomes are possible: 1) insignificant morphological change, when wave runup just overtops the barrier crest and flow velocities are very weak; 2) overtopping, resulting in accretion on the barrier crest region and barrier stabilisation; and 3) overwashing, resulting in erosion, lowering of the crest region and ultimately to barrier inundation. This study provides an insight into the critical conditions that distinguish these two possible outcomes and to the different mechanisms that provide the required positive and negative feedbacks to the sediment dynamics. In order to define the overwash threshold condition, and to predict the morphological outcome of particular overwash events, use is made here of the . Overwash Potential (. OP), defined as the difference between the wave runup and the barrier crest elevation. To make effective use of . OP it is necessary to identify a reliable runup predictor. Following tests using 12 runup equations the Stockdon et al. [Stockdon, H.F., Holman, R.A., Howd, P.A., Sallenger, A.H., 2006. Empirical parameterization of setup, swash, and runup. Coast. Eng., 53, 573-588] approach has been identified as the best predictor of runup conditions necessary to generate positive values of . OP, with overtopping and overwashing predicted to occur for average OP values of 0.2. m and 0.5. m, respectively. The use of . OP values provides a practical means by which to identify potential coastal hazards associated with gravel barrier overwash processes and is considered to have a range of practical coastal management applications. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The transport of these chemicals in international basins is a subject of major interest in the management committee of the aforementioned basins. The mass of active molecules of the pesticides applied in the Comoé basin (BVC) was evaluated using the agricultural statistics and pesticides formulation. Pesticides distribution and water resources vulnerability to these chemicals were also apprehended in the BVC by considering agricultural practices, climatic and edaphic parameters and the mass applied. Pesticides distribution followed the agricultural speculations within the basin. A total of 44 active molecules and copper hydroxide were recorded. These molecules were grouped in 22 families. The Lagoons (38) and South-Comoé (32) regions containing the highest number of active molecules seemed the most expose to pesticides pollution. Approximately 644 t of pesticides were applied to the agricultural speculations. Atrazine (17%), carbosulfan (16%), chlorpyriphos-éthyl (12%) and the metolachlore (10%) account for 55% of this mass. Carbosulfan (159 kg.ha -1), fosetyl (52 kg.ha-1) and phenamiphos (20 kg.ha -1) had the highest application intensities. These molecules could contribute to water resources degradation. © 2012 EuroJournals Publishing, Inc.

Cheves is a 168MW hydroelectric scheme under development north of Lima, Peru, by Norway's SN Power and scheduled to be commissioned by late 2013. SN Power is undertaking the project through a special purpose company, Empresa de Generacion Electrica Cheves SA. Other companies supplying the scheme are: Rainpower, ABB and Jeumont Electric for the electro-mechanical works; Abengoa Peru for the 75km long, 220kV transmission line; and Cempro Tech for the hydraulic steel works. The project area, some 200km from Lima, is reached by the Huaura-Sayan-Churin- Oyon highway, running from the coast up the valley with asphalted surface and then gravel road makeup. The local hydrology is typical for a coastal valley of the Andes mountains with little precipitation.

In recent years, the economic and financial constraints faced by monitoring agencies have led to the initiation of network reduction procedures in the space domain (i.e., the reduction of the number of stations within a network). In this regard, the dynamic programming approach (DPA) can be effectively used to determine which monitoring sites are to be preserved when the network is consolidated for a fixed number of stations. However, previous studies on the use of the DPA methodology in network redesign have not yet resolved two basic questions: (1) what is the required (optimum) number of stations to be retained in the network to best represent the basin? and (2) how many subbasins should be selected when segregating the basin into smaller units as foreseen by DPA? Accordingly, the primary objective of this paper is to modify the DPA approach to determine the optimum number of stations to be retained when consolidating a monitoring network. In previous studies, the selection of subbasins in DPA was realized basically by subjective approaches based on general experiences of the designers so that the secondary objective of the study is to expand the capabilities of DPA by utilizing a more systematic approach to subbasin identification. The previously mentioned modifications to the DPA methodology are demonstrated in the case of a water quality monitoring network in Gediz River basin along the Aegean coast of Turkey. The results obtained indicate that DPA can also be an effective tool in optimizing the number of stations to be retained in a monitoring network. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Among remote sensing techniques, synthetic aperture radar is a particularly advantageous method to monitor mangroves: images are not dependent on cloud cover and can provide information from forest understory. This article mapped mangrove forests in the southern coast of São Paulo State (Brazil) using frequency-based contextual classification of incoherent attributes derived from a multi-polarized Phased Array L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) image. The use of 10 incoherent attributes and only 3 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) vegetation indices as input for digital classification showed the best accuracies with kappa index values of 0.739 and 0.734, respectively. HH polarization and SAR vegetation indices were the attributes that contributed most to the mangrove mapping procedure. The use of L-Band SAR data was effective for mapping mangrove areas, and therefore it is recommended as a tool for coastal management. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

To comprehensively record tsunami trace heights and impacts along the coastal region, the Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami Joint Survey Group was organized immediately after the event. As part of this group, the authors conducted a field survey in Miyagi and Fukushima Prefectures. The surveyed area can be divided into 2 parts from the point of view of its geographical features: the northern part (a rias coastal area) and the southern part (a coastal plain area). In this paper, the characteristics of the damage due to the tsunami in each area are analyzed by using both the results of the authors' own field survey and the Joint Survey Group. In the rias coastal area, inundation heights were more than 10 m, which resulted in the flooding of the low-lying grounds located at the inner part of the bays. The tsunami wave caused widespread destruction in this area, and coastal buildings (including reinforced concrete buildings) suffered severe damage. In the southern coastal plains, inundation heights were 510 m and the tsunami reached a few kilometers inland, though unfortunately there were not enough high locations or buildings for the residents to evacuate. In addition, an extensive line of coastal dikes and forests, which had been placed to protect the wide plains behind them, also suffered extensive damage. From these geographically dependent inundation and destruction patterns, a number of important lessons on how to modify and improve future risk management strategies can be obtained. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company and Japan Society of Civil Engineers.	2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku earthquake; coastal structure; field survey; Tsunami; tsunami trace height	Coastal area; Coastal dikes; Coastal plain; Coastal regions; Coastal structures; East coast; Field surveys; Geographical features; Local time; Risk management strategies; Tsunami waves; Coastal zones; Earthquakes; Floods; Risk management; Surveys; Tsunamis						(2005) Guidelines for Tsunami Evacuation Buildings, , http://www.bousai.go.jp/oshirase/h17/tsunami.hinan.html, Cabinet Office Government of Japanm, (in Japanese; Danielsen, F., Sorensen, M.K., Olwig, M.F., Selvam, V., Parish, F., Burgess, N.D., Hiraishi, T., Suryadiputra, N., The Asian tsunami: A protective role for coastal vegetation (2005) Science, 310 (5748), p. 643. , DOI 10.1126/science.1118387; (2011) Disaster information for 2011 of the Paciffic coast of Tohoku earthquake, (140). , http://www.fdma.go.jp/bn/higaihou.html, Fire and Disaster Management Agency, (in Japanese; (2009) Enclosed Coastal Seas in Japan, , http://www.emecs.or.jp/closedsea-jp/closedsea-jp.htm, International EMECS Center,(in Japanese; Kakinuma, T., Tsujimoto, G., Yasuda, T., Tamada, T., Trace survey of the 2011 tohoku tsunami in the north of miyagi prefecture and numerical simulation of bidirectional tsunamis in utatsusaki peninsula (2012) Coast.

The trend is not confined to America: Just about all new housing built in China over the last 10 years is gated, with neighbourhood walls, guards, owner-governance structures, fees and neighbourhood management and investment plans based not on the municipal government model but on the model of the member-controlled club: hence the idea of 'cities of clubs'. Residential club economics are compelling. There is, in principle, no reason why large parts of British cities should not evolve in this way. While this will happen piecemeal under current laws, urban land reform that allows neighbourhoods to opt-out of municipal ownership and governance of non-strategic local public goods, could fundamentally reshape British cities for the better. It would also spawn a multi-billion pound private neighbourhood management market and replace the long-waves of urban decay and renewal that are characteristic of public ownership, with a far more responsive re-investment regime.

STLE's certified metalworking fluids specialist	2012	Tribology and Lubrication Technology	68	3		20	22			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84858249965&partnerID=40&md5=19deec53bf84a741a60fa60b157616f5		Gresham, R.M.	The article focuses on the importance of the STLE's Certified Metalworking Fluids Specialist (CMFS) certification. CMFS process is different from many certificate programs where an individual takes a classroom or online course and then takes a test on the material presented. Typically, a CMFS is the individual who evaluates and selects the proper MWFs to use, as well as the appropriate fluid-control measures. Facilitating effective communication between fluid suppliers, end-users, peers and other stakeholders is an essential function of a CMFS-certified individual. This person has broad knowledge of fluid chemistry, machining processes, tooling, filtration, metallurgy and waste treatment. With recessionary pressures continuing, maintaining a competitive edge is critical not just for maintaining profitability but for survival itself. Beyond employee health and safety issues, researchers are now addressing the impact of operations on air pollution as evidenced by the recent activity on VOCs of MWFs by the South Coast Air Quality Management.

Mike Anderson shares his views on the impact of budget restrictions on roadside vegetation management in Rapid City. The city was in news in January 2012 the city council honored the request of the budget-restrained parks department to no longer maintain the sides of approximately 25 miles of rural roads inside city limits. The council did not enact any new legislation, but re-emphasized an existing city ordinance that has been enforced for residential landowners. Agencies responsible for roads at the state, county, and city level from coast to coast agreed that there were budgetary constraints. Roadside vegetation management was one of the areas that were significantly affected by such budgetary constraints. Independent contractors hired by the commercial and industrial landowners were given the responsibility for roadside vegetation management where Rapid City's parks department was unable to fulfill its obligations.

In this study, it developed an approach to estimate vulnerability to agricultural drought based on the expand grey relation analysis method (GRA).The new methodology consists of (1) developing the main influence factors of vulnerability to agricultural drought and converting them into quantitative indicators, (2) constructing the evaluation standards and their relative weights based on the collected data on the values of the indicators from 31 provinces and cities in China, (3) computing the vulnerability to agricultural drought of 31 provinces and cities in China in 2009 using expand GRA method. The results indicated that the vulnerability to agricultural drought in the southeast coast of China with more precipitation and irrigation is lower than the central areas; the most vulnerable areas are the west area with less precipitation and irrigation. Some measures for mitigating the vulnerability to agricultural drought in different areas were proposed. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This article seeks to draw lessons for management of complex hazardous activities from these events by analysing critical decisions regarding well control barriers. Concepts such as trial and error learning, sensemaking and the need for multiple barriers are used to demonstrate why the organisation was blind to the developing problems and hence why lack of technical competence alone is not sufficient to explain the events that occurred. Three organisational improvements are proposed - providing active supervision, improved technical integrity assurance and better use of risk assessment. The article concludes with an appeal for changes in regulatory policy regarding safety to include organisational issues in addition to the traditional technical focus. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we present a standalone remote video-based method that estimates wave height at the breakpoint. Individual breaking events are first identified from changes in optical properties and wave height is further derived from the optical signature at the onset of breaking. An extended validation is performed using a dense wave basin dataset. The results show the ability of the method to measure individual breaker heights (9% of mean error, 18% RMS). In addition, the unique combination of in situ and remotely sensed data allows the estimation of two other breaking-related parameters, the height-to-depth ratio and wave front face slope, which show a substantial amount of dispersion. Because nearshore video systems are rapidly spreading over world coasts, this low-cost remote breaker height estimator should encounter large interest in coastal engineering studies. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Coastal tourism in Thailand, Sri Lanka and the Maldives was significantly affected. Examples from Phuket Island, Khao Lak and Ko Phi Phi Don, Thailand, show the variation in the impacts, recovery and resilience of Thai tourist coasts, focusing primarily on beach recovery and the reconstruction of the tourist industry. As priority was given to Phuket Island, tourism recovered after 1 year. Khao Lak was the worst affected and has yet to fully recover. Ko Phi Phi Don recovered but is plagued by land-use problems. Various mitigation measures have been implemented to increase the resilience of the tourist coasts. However, the resilience of the Thai tourist coasts in the event of a future tsunami is questionable. © The Geological Society of London 2012.		beach; disaster management; earthquake; Indian Ocean tsunami 2004; land use; tourism development; Indian Ocean; Maldives; Sri Lanka; Thailand						Adger, W.N., Hughes, T.P., Folke, C., Carpenter, S.R., Rockström, J., Social-ecological resilience to coastal disasters (2005) Science, 309, pp. 1036-1039; Ahmed, A.K., (2006) Concepts and Practices of 'Resilience': A Compilation from Various Secondary Sources, , US IOTWS (Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System) Program Document, 05-IOTWS-06; Alovisi, J., Hassam, N., Logan, D., Milligan, A., (2005) Tsunami: Indian Ocean Event and Investigation into Potential Global Risks, , Guy Carpenter, London; (2005) Seaports and Coastal Aspects, , http://www.asce.org/files/pdf/tsunami/2-8.pdf, ASCE.

A combination of factors contributed to loss of life, including the lack of defined evacuation routes. This vulnerability to tsunami attacks has recently been addressed with the demarcation of evacuation routes, along both well-maintained arteries and native surface (unpaved) roads. However, poor location design and irregular maintenance will reduce the lifetime that the latter can provide safe egress from remote coastlines. In this work we identified 10 major gullies and 18 landslides along a critical 0.5 km section of a tsunami evacuation road accessing a remote beach of the Andaman Coast in southern Thailand. Erosion rates from landslides and gullies approached 9500 Mg ha -1 in less than a year following widening of the road. Importantly, the degradation features, landslides in particular, reduced the effectiveness of the road to serve as a safe passageway to escape future tsunamis or large storm surges. This study demonstrates that greater attention should be given to appropriate road location, design and maintenance in integrated programmes aimed at reducing tsunami vulnerability in remote coastal areas, not only on the Andaman Coast, but worldwide. © The Geological Society of London 2012.		gully; hazard management; Indian Ocean tsunami 2004; landslide; storm surge; tsunami; vulnerability; Thailand						Birkland, T.A., Herabat, P., Little, P.G., Wallace, W.A., The impact of the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami on tourism in Thailand (2006) Earthquake Spectra, 22, pp. S889-S900; Calgaro, E., Lloyd, K., Sun, sea, sand and tsunami: examining disaster vulnerability in the tourism community of Khao Lak, Thailand (2008) Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography, 29, pp. 288-306; Charnkol, T., Tanaboriboon, Y., Evacuee behaviors and factors affecting the tsunami trip generation model: a case study in Phang-nga, Thailand (2006) Journal of Advanced Transportation, 40, pp. 313-330; Cochard, R., Ranamukhaarachchi, S.L., Shivakoti, G.P., Shipin, O.V., Edwards, P.J., Seeland, K.L., The 2004 tsunami in Aceh and southern Thailand: a review on coastal ecosystems, wave hazards and vulnerability (2008) Perspectives in Plant Ecology Evolution and Systematics, 10, pp. 3-40; DeGraff, J.V., Landslide dams from the November 1988 storm event in southern Thailand (1990) Landslide News, 4, pp. 12-15; Edwards, C., Thailand lifelines after the December 2004 Great Sumatra earthquake and Indian Ocean tsunami (2004) Earthquake Spectra, 22, pp. S641-S659; (1998) Watershed Management Field Manual: Road Design and Conservation in Sensitive Watersheds, , FAO.

The significance of regulatory framework on safety climate	2012	Advances in Safety, Reliability and Risk Management - Proceedings of the European Safety and Reliability Conference, ESREL 2011				2969	2976			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84856753719&partnerID=40&md5=bf5378ea5c221afbd4d94dacfd49461a	NTNU Social Research, Trondheim, Norway; SINTEF, Trondheim, Norway	Bye, R.J., NTNU Social Research, Trondheim, Norway; Røyrvik, J., NTNU Social Research, Trondheim, Norway; Lamvik, G.M., SINTEF, Trondheim, Norway	In 2010 we carried out a survey among crew members on coastal cargo vessels operating primarily in Norwegian waters. The aim of the survey was to measure safety climate and risk perception among the crew members. In addition, observation of work practice was carried out on 10 cargo vessels. The survey data shows significant differences between (1) Scandinavian speaking, (2) Russian speaking and (3) Filipinos, thus suggesting that safety climate are determined by different cultural interpretations. However; observations and interviews shows that working conditions and the formal work contexts vary for the people of these different nationalities even though they all sail on cargo vessels, owned by Norwegian ship owners, operating only on the Norwegian coast. We suggest that varying safety climate must be understood by the differences of the regulatory framework they work within. Seafarers of different vessels work under varying regimes dependent on the flag state they sail under; deciding contract formalities and regulatory framework for that vessel. Based on the 2010 survey, in this paper we therefore discuss the relations of varying flag state and ship registers, regulatory framework and safety climate. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.

DECC and Macondo - Time for change	2012	Offshore Engineer	37	2		28	33			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84858980801&partnerID=40&md5=e90c8f8166d37e7b094f5b38a29c9229		Fitisimmons, I.	Consultant Ian Fitzsimmons discusses whether any lessons have been learnt by the UK's offshore regulators post-Macondo. In the US, within a month of Macondo, the Minerals Management Service was reorganized with the creation of BOEMRE to regulate the US offshore industry. MMS became the US licensing and royalty authority - stripped of its regulatory authority. While the HSE Offshore Division (OSD) deals with safety regulation offshore, the DECC deals fundamentally with exploration & production licensing, field development approval, environmental compliance, leak & spill containment, and statutory legislation and instruments. While the US Presidential Commission, BOEMRE and the US Coast Guard have between them set a new world standard for open, concise and constructive reporting of offshore mishaps in the wake of Macondo - readily accessible by public and industry alike - the recent DECC offering falls woefully short of that mark. It is both insipid and fawning.

The goal of this study is to understand and explain shadow evacuation by comparing perceived risks with engineering risk estimates at the household level-particularly in nonevacuation zones where undesirable evacuation decisions are made-rather than by comparing perceived risks with regional hazards that previous studies have measured. A proposed methodology to compute engineering risk estimates from hurricane hazards is illustrated for approximately one million properties in Harris County, Texas. These risks are then compared with risk perceptions from a survey of residents which was conducted after Hurricane Ike's landfall in 2008. The results show that evacuation behavior is related to a hurricane-induced surge and wind risk mismatch and that risk overestimation and underestimation are more likely seen in locations near the waterways. The results also show that shadow evacuation is partly attributable to risk overestimation. The overestimation of damage risk from wind or surge correlates to 108,031 shadow evacuees. This is more than the total number of households in Galveston County that need to evacuate in the event of a hurricane-primarily through Harris County-and who may be subjected to traffic delays caused by shadow evacuees. The spatial distribution of risk mismatch provides opportunity for emergency managers to effectively plan and respond to hurricanes, while preventing unwanted evacuation. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Simplistic geospatial techniques in analyzing transportation dynamics for origin-destination container movement routes in the United States	2012	Jiaotong Yunshu Xitong Gongcheng Yu Xinxi/Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology	12	1		79	90			http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84858376731&partnerID=40&md5=f654374cfd6a1cc966c4b8a25d53bfa1	North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND 58108, United States	Lee, E., North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND 58108, United States; Oduor, P.G., North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND 58108, United States; Farahmand, K., North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND 58108, United States	Spatial analyses incorporating rudimentary techniques are essential to understand container transportation. Most transportation datasets are offered as raw disjoint data containing dissimilar attributes from different sources making them difficult to fathom any spatial linkages. Route optimization and market accessibility are increasingly becoming important and significant as newer container decongestion methods are put in place. Origin-Destination dichotomies can best be harnessed in the United States by optimizing routes based on available databases. In this study, the Public Use Waybill sample database from Surface Transporation Board were used as preliminary inputs for inland railway route optimization. The paper utilized an approach akin to one used in riverine management to optimize container routes. From the primer databases, in as much as most import containers originate from Asia and Europe and shipped to the U. S. through specific North American ports, a significant portion gets to inland markets through Pacific coast in the U. S. The main hub ports for import containers are Los Angeles/Long Beach and Seattle for transpacific trade and New York/New Jersey and Savannah for transatlantic trade. An anomalous and notably high volume flow can be observed between the Pacific coast and the Mississippi valley area including metropolitan areas like Minneapolis, Chicago, Kansas City, Memphis, Dallas, and Houston. Assessing movement in the Midwest to east U. S. , most container traffic volume passes through New York/New Jersey and Norfolk to end in Chicago. It can thus be surmized that an in-depth preliminary assessment of container routing can provide a parametric basis for higher-level cost and multi-modal analyses.

The net is similar to ecosystem in which members highly dependent with each other. This new relationship enhances enterprise operation efficiency, but brings about more risk factors in the same time. In recent years, all kinds of supply chain interruptions have made many companies suffer great loss. More and more cases show that, with the increasing complexity, supply chain vulnerability is also increasing. As we know, the terrorist attack 9.11 happening in 2001 forced North American airport to close, causing thousands of supply chains interrupted and inestimable loss. In September 2002, workers stroked in the west coast of United States, which is the main gateway for China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company (COSCO) to enter the nation, leading COSCO lost at least 24 million dollars in two weeks. In recent years, China's poison milk powder event caused international concern, all kinds of food safety problems aroused, reflecting the absence of supply chain risk management. In February 27, 2010, 8.8 earthquakes happened in Chile, resulting in global copper prices raised. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

The report takes aim at blowout preventers in general. BOP systems commonly in use - including the system used by the Deepwater Horizon - are neither designed nor tested to operate in the dynamic conditions that occurred during the accident. BP remains embroiled in litigation with both companies in federal court in New Orleans. In early December, BP accused Halliburton of destroying evidence relating to post-incident testing of the foam cement slurry used during P&A operations and of failing to produce potentially incriminating computer modeling evidence, which Halliburton claims is missing. BSEE issued an initial round of INCs in October 2011, shortly after the release of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation & Enforcement/US Coast Guard Joint Investigation Team report on the incident.

As one of the provinces in the southeast coast of China, Fujian develop a low-carbon economy directly relating to the transformation of its economic growth, conservation of energy, improvement of productivity, innovation of technology and so on. We can say that the development of low-carbon economy directly affects the sustainable development of economy and society in Fujian province of China. Therefore, firstly, we believe that government and enterprise should optimize the allocation of resource and improve the utilization of resource. Secondly, the tax policies are supposed to adjust to stimulate the development of environmental protection industry. Thirdly, government should accelerate the construction of infrastructures. Fourthly, the legal system needs to be built and perfected so as to promote the development of low-carbon economy. At last, the investment of techniques is supposed to increase to a certain degree, and the ability of innovation and management of enterprises should be promoted to adapt the development of low-carbon economy of Fujian province. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

In 15 years, Montpellier will have built a 55 km tramway network at a total cost of EUR 1.5 billion. TaM and Authority Montpellier Agglomération was the first in France to introduce a single ticket not only for bus, tram, P+R, and TER. The creation of a system of 12 P&R facilities connecting up with tram lines offering parking space for some 4,000 cars has strengthened TaM's involvement. The flat rates for P&R parking are calculated to not exceed the cost of two hours of city-center parking. TaM has also introduced Vélolmagg, a public service for low-cost bicycles.

However, groundwater abstraction can exceed recharge during times of drought, resulting in saline intrusion. Following hydrogeological investigations in the 1970s and 1980s, a regional groundwater model was developed to underpin the tactical management of the aquifer. Although it is a coarse, single-layer, constant-density model, routine regulatory use of the model since 1988 has enabled a sustainable level of groundwater abstraction to be reached and brought saline intrusion under control. Abstraction rates have been proactively adjusted to suit prevailing conditions using model forecasts. Forecasts are evaluated against model-based thresholds, set by comparing model output (e.g. aquifer-estuary flux) with observed data (e.g. groundwater salinity). The success of the model in managing groundwater resources is attributed to: field-based hydrogeological investigations informing the model design; collaboration between regulators and abstractors, which has built confidence in the model results; commitment to updating the model; and flexibility in the supply network through conjunctive use of ground and surface water. The model has also been applied for purposes not considered during development and has therefore provided value for money for the UK water industry over a 30 year period.		aquifer; groundwater; groundwater resource; hydrogeology; numerical model; recharge; saline intrusion; water industry; water supply; England; Lincolnshire; United Kingdom						Berridge, N.G., Pattison, J., (1994) Geology of the Country Around Grimsby and Patrington, , London, British Geological Survey/HMSO, Memoir for the 1:50 000 geological sheets 90 and 91 and 81 and 82 (England and Wales); (2009) Lincolnshire Chalk and Spilsby Sandstone Groundwater Investigation: Regional Conceptualisation Overview Report, , ENTEC UK, Contractor Report for the Environment Agency of England and Wales, Anglian Region; Gray, D.A., (1964) Ground-water Conditions of the Chalk of the Grimsby Area, Lincolnshire, 1. , Water Supply Papers of the Geological Survey of Great Britain.

Tension over equitable allocation of water: Estimating renewable groundwater resources beneath the West Bank and Israel	2012	Geological Society Special Publication	362	1		355	361		2	http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84863861493&partnerID=40&md5=3c1bd91fe875621d6a3835949e01a4fd	British Geological Survey, Kingsley Dunham Centre, Keyworth, Nottingham NG12 5GG, United Kingdom; British Geological Survey, Maclean Building Wallingford, Oxfordshire OX10 8BB, United Kingdom	Mansour, M.M., British Geological Survey, Kingsley Dunham Centre, Keyworth, Nottingham NG12 5GG, United Kingdom; Peach, D.W., British Geological Survey, Kingsley Dunham Centre, Keyworth, Nottingham NG12 5GG, United Kingdom; Hughes, A.G., British Geological Survey, Kingsley Dunham Centre, Keyworth, Nottingham NG12 5GG, United Kingdom; Robins, N.S., British Geological Survey, Maclean Building Wallingford, Oxfordshire OX10 8BB, United Kingdom	Competition for water resources between Palestine and Israel is an ongoing cause of tension. The Western Aquifer Basin forms a major part of the complex, largely karst, limestone system of the West Bank Mountain Aquifer. The aquifer crops out and is recharged solely in the semi-arid uplands of the West Bank and groundwater flows west beneath Israel to discharge at the Yarqon and Nahal Taninim springs near the Mediterranean coast. Annual recharge to the aquifer is not easy to quantify but lies within the range 270×106 to 455×106 m3 a-1, and current uncertainties do not support definition of a single value of long-term average recharge. The resource is heavily exploited and abstraction is directly controlled and apportioned between Israel and the West Bank by Israel. The key to equitable apportionment is the determination of the long-term average recharge to the basin, which also requires definition of the eastern boundary of the basin to confirm the recharge area. Calculations include empirical formulae and process-based models that are likely to constrain the best estimate provided that there is appropriate, ongoing monitoring. Improved understanding can then be fed back into the model. © The Geological Society of London 2012.		aquifer; competition (economics); discharge; estimation method; groundwater flow; groundwater resource; quantitative analysis; renewable resource; resource allocation; resource management; Israel; Occupied Territories; West Bank						Assaf, K., Khatib, N., Kally, E., Shuval, H., (1993) A Proposal for the Development of A Regional Water Master Plan, , Jerusalem, Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information; Bachmat, Y., (1995) Hydrologic Model of the Western Mountain Groundwater Basin for Stage 1, Harvard Middle East Water Project, , USA, Technical report Institute for Social and Economic Policy in the Middle East, Harvard University; Bredenkamp, D.B., Botha, L.J., van Tonder, G.J., van Rensburg, H.J., (1995) Manual on Estimation of Groundwater Recharge and Aquifer Storativity, , Report Water Research Commission, Pretoria TT 73/95; (1998) Study of the Sustainable Yield of the Eastern Aquifer Basin Final Report, , CDM, Ramallah, Palestine, Camp Dresser McKee/Morgan report for Palestinian Water Authority and US Agency for International Development, PWA; Deconinck, S., Water wars: resource issues in Israel and Palestine (2006) The Global Environment 2006, pp. 50-51. , Yarrow E.
