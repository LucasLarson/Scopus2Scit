ALONSO E.E., RAMON A.	MASSIVE SULFATE ATTACK TO CEMENT TREATED RAILWAY EMBANKMENTS	2013	GEOTECHNIQUE	63	10		857	870			HTTP://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URL?EID2 S2.0 84883309041&PARTNERID40&MD5517329D0A30A7AB7213E5238D3845B35	DEPARTMENT OF GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES, UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE CATALUNYA, BARCELONA, SPAIN	ALONSO, E.E., DEPARTMENT OF GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES, UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE CATALUNYA, BARCELONA, SPAIN; RAMON, A., DEPARTMENT OF GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES, UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE CATALUNYA, BARCELONA, SPAIN	TWO ACCESS EMBANKMENTS TO A RAILWAY BRIDGE, HAVING A MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF 18 M, EXPERIENCED A CONTINUOUS AND SEVERE HEAVE SHORTLY AFTER CONSTRUCTION. VERTICAL DISPLACEMENTS REACHED 120 MM IN A 2 YEAR PERIOD. THE EMBANKMENTS WERE DESIGNED, BY INCLUDING SOIL CEMENT TREATED TRANSITION WEDGES, TO PROVIDE AN INCREASINGLY RIGID SUPPORT AS THE TRAINS APPROACH THE STIFF BRIDGE ABUTMENTS. A GRID OF 10 M DEEP JET GROUTING COLUMNS WAS ALSO BUILT, WITH THE PURPOSE OF STABILISING THE EMBANKMENTS. INSTEAD, A SUSTAINED SWELLING DEFORMATION, WHICH EXTENDED TO DEPTHS OF 8 10 M, WAS ACTIVATED. THE COMPACTED SOIL WAS LOW PLASTICITY CLAYEY MATERIAL, WITH A VARIABLE PERCENTAGE OF GYPSUM. THE EMBANKMENTS SUFFERED A MASSIVE ETTRINGITE THAUMASITE ATTACK, WHICH WAS TRIGGERED BY THE SIMULTANEOUS PRESENCE OF CEMENT, CLAY, SULFATES AND AN EXTERNAL SUPPLY OF WATER (RAIN). THE PAPER DESCRIBES THE FIELD EXTENSOMETER AND INCLINOMETER RECORDS, THE LONG TERM LABORATORY TESTS PERFORMED, SOME MINERALOGICAL OBSERVATIONS AND THE REACTIONS LEADING TO THE GROWTH OF EXPANSIVE CRYSTALS, AND PRESENTS A MODEL THAT SIMULATES THE MEASURED HEAVE. FORCES ACTING AGAINST THE BRIDGE, WHICH WAS SERIOUSLY DAMAGED, WERE ESTIMATED. REMEDIAL MEASURES INCLUDE REMOVAL OF THE ACTIVE UPPER ZONE OF THE EMBANKMENTS, AND THE CONSTRUCTION IN STAGES OF SLABS SUPPORTING THE RAILS AND FOUNDED ON PILES BUILT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE EMBANKMENTS. THE CASE IS CONSIDERED UNIQUE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE REACTION DEVELOPED IN THE EMBANKMENTS, AND ITS DAMAGING ACTION ON THE NEARBY BRIDGE STRUCTURE.

WITHIN A CRITICAL STATE SOIL MECHANICS FRAMEWORK, THE RESPONSE OF A SAND IS CONSIDERED TO DEPEND ON ITS STATE, THAT IS, THE COMBINATION OF VOID RATIO AND EFFECTIVE STRESS. WHEN SOIL IS CONSIDERED FROM A PARTICLE SCALE PERSPECTIVE, THE PACKING DENSITY IS OFTEN DESCRIBED USING THE COORDINATION NUMBER (CN), THAT IS, THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF CONTACTS PER PARTICLE. USING PARTICLES WITH SIMPLE GEOMETRIES, DISCRETE ELEMENT METHOD (DEM) SIMULATIONS, PHOTOELASTIC TESTS AND EXPERIMENTS ON ANALOGUE SOILS (E.G. GLASS BALLOTINI) HAVE ALL DEMONSTRATED A CORRELATION BETWEEN CN AND MECHANICAL RESPONSE. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES WHETHER THESE CORRELATIONS APPLY TO REAL SOILS USING DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF THE FABRIC VIA MICRO COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (MICRO CT). A VARIETY OF SCALAR FABRIC DESCRIPTORS WAS MEASURED DURING THE TRIAXIAL COMPRESSION OF BOTH INTACT AND RECONSTITUTED REIGATE SAND SAMPLES. WHILE EACH OF THE PARAMETERS CONSIDERED PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION, THE CONTACT INDEX (CI), A PARAMETER THAT TAKES THE CONTACT AREA INTO ACCOUNT, WAS FOUND TO BE A MORE SENSITIVE METRIC IN ASSESSING THE EFFECTS OF FABRIC THAN COORDINATION NUMBER, BRANCH VECTOR LENGTH OR VOID SIZE.

THE STUDY SHOWS THAT THE ZINC AND LEAD SATURATED SAMPLES PRESENT LOWER LIQUID LIMIT, LOWER FREE SWELLING STRAIN AND SWELLING PRESSURE, AND HIGHER PERMEABILITY. X RAY DIFFRACTION ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE PRESENCE OF LEAD RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN THE ANISOTROPY OF THE SAMPLE. WITH ZINC, THE FABRIC ISOTROPY INCREASES, WHICH CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO HIGHER CLAY METAL INTERACTIONS. MERCURY INTRUSION POROSIMETRY SHOWS THAT THE SATURATION OF THE SAMPLE WITH LEAD AND ZINC REDUCES THE INTER AGGREGATE PORE VOLUME.

CONSOLIDATION BEHAVIOUR OF THE SLURRY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WILL REDUCE THE TOTAL EFFECTIVE STRESS OWING TO MOBILISATION OF FRICTIONAL FORCE BETWEEN THE SIDE WALL OF THE TRENCH AND THE SLURRY. COMPRESSIBILITY OF THE SLURRY OF BENTONITE IS EXPECTED TO UNDERGO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OWING TO AMENDMENT WITH ORGANO CLAY AND ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THE FLUID. STANDARD ONE DIMENSIONAL CONSOLIDATION TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT ON SLURRIES OF BENTONITE, ORGANO CLAY AND THEIR MIXTURES BY REMOULDING THEM TO THEIR RESPECTIVE LIQUID LIMIT CONSISTENCY WITH WATER AS WELL AS FLUIDS OF LOW POLARITY, SUCH AS CARBON TETRACHLORIDE, AND INUNDATING WITH DIFFERENT FLUIDS. ORGANO CLAY AND ITS MIXTURE WITH BENTONITE WHEN MOULDED WITH WATER EXHIBIT LOWER COMPRESSIBILITY THAN BENTONITE IN ANY PORE FLUID, BUT THEIR COMPRESSIBILITY INCREASES WHEN MOULDED WITH CARBON TETRACHLORIDE AND INUNDATED WITH THE SAME FLUID. THESE CHANGES IN THE COMPRESSIBILITY OF BENTONITE AMENDED WITH ORGANO CLAY ARE EXPLAINED BY PARTICLE REARRANGEMENTS, CHANGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DIFFUSE DOUBLE LAYER AND CONTRIBUTION FROM THE WATER ADSORBED IN THE INTER LAMELLAR SPACE OF THE CLAY.

THE EFFECTS ON LATERAL DISPLACEMENT OF THE MAGNITUDES OF EMBANKMENT LOADING, AS WELL AS THE VACUUM PRESSURE, THE LOADING RATE, AND THE UNDRAINED SHEAR STRENGTH AND CONSOLIDATION PROPERTIES OF THE SOIL DEPOSIT, HAVE BEEN EXPLICITLY INCLUDED IN A NEWLY DEFINED PARAMETER, WHICH IS GIVEN BY THE RATIO OF AN INDEX PRESSURE TO THE REPRESENTATIVE SOIL SHEAR STRENGTH (RLS). THE RATIO OF DELTANM TO THE SURFACE SETTLEMENT UNDER THE EMBANKMENT CENTRELINE, SF, IS ALSO DEFINED AS THE NORMALISED MAXIMUM (NET) LATERAL DISPLACEMENT (NLD). A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RLS AND NLD HAS BEEN PROPOSED, WITH A PRESCRIBED RANGE, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF 18 FIELD CASE HISTORIES FROM 12 DIFFERENT PROJECT SITES IN FIVE COUNTRIES. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE PROPOSED RELATIONSHIP CAN BE USED AS A PRELIMINARY DESIGN TOOL FOR PRELOADING PROJECTS INVOLVING COMBINATIONS OF A VACUUM PRESSURE AND AN EMBANKMENT PRESSURE AS WELL AS PVD IMPROVEMENT.

THE MICROBIALLY INDUCED CALCIUM CARBONATE PRECIPITATION PROCESS WAS USED TO FORM A LOWPERMEABILITY LAYER IN SAND FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A WATER POND MODEL IN THE LABORATORY. THE TEST RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE PERMEABILITY OF SAND WAS REDUCED FROM THE ORDER OF 10 4 M/S TO 10 7 M/S WHEN AN AVERAGE 2.1 KG OF CALCIUM (CA) PER M2 OF SAND SURFACE WAS PRECIPITATED. THE BENDING STRENGTHS OF THE WALLS AND THE BASE OF THE MODEL POND WERE IN THE RANGE OF 90 256 KPA. THE UNCONFINED COMPRESSIVE STRENGTHS FOR THE SAMPLES TAKEN FROM THE WALLS AND THE BASE OF THE POND WERE IN THE RANGE OF 215 932 KPA.

THE MAIN FEATURE OF THE MODIFIED FORMULATION IS THE ABILITY TO CONSIDER BOTH INHERENT AND INDUCED ANISOTROPY CONDITIONS WITHIN THE ASSEMBLY. THIS WAS ACHIEVED BY AMENDING THE DEFINITION OF THE CONTACT VECTOR BETWEEN PARTICLES IN THE STRESS FORCE FABRIC RELATIONSHIP. BY USING NUMERICAL DISCRETEELEMENT METHOD (DEM), A SERIES OF INHERENTLY ANISOTROPIC GRANULAR MATERIALS WERE SIMULATED IN ORDER TO VERIFY THE ACCURACY OF THE PROPOSED FORMULATION. IN THE SIMULATIONS, THE GEOMETRY OF THE PARTICLES WAS CHOSEN TO BE IRREGULAR POLYGONS. THE SHEAR CAPACITY OF THE ASSEMBLIES DURING THE LOADING PROCESS WAS CALCULATED FROM DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF MACROSCOPIC STRESS COMPONENTS, AND FROM ANISOTROPY FABRIC PARAMETERS. BY COMPARING THE RESULTS, IT IS SHOWN THAT REASONABLE AGREEMENT EXISTS BETWEEN THE CALCULATED AND MEASURED VALUES.

THE MAIN GOAL IS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF RAINFALL INDUCED FLOW SLIDES. FOR THIS PURPOSE, A COUPLED HYDROMECHANICAL CONSTITUTIVE MODEL IS COMBINED WITH A SIMPLIFIED APPROACH FOR THE ANALYSIS OF INFINITE SLOPES. SIMPLE SHEAR TEST SIMULATIONS ARE USED TO EVALUATE TRIGGERING PERTURBATIONS AND INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF BOTH INITIAL SUCTION AND STRESS ANISOTROPY IN THE ACTIVATION OF SLOPE FAILURES. THE NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS CLEARLY SHOW THAT DIFFERENT MECHANISMS OF ACTIVATION CAN BE ORIGINATED. THE ONSET OF INSTABILITY IS DETECTED BY INTRODUCING APPROPRIATE STABILITY INDICES FOR DISTINCT MODES OF FAILURE: LOCALISED SHEAR FAILURE, STATIC LIQUEFACTION AND WETTING INDUCED COLLAPSE. CRITICAL INTERVALS OF SLOPE INCLINATIONS ARE IDENTIFIED, CAUTIONING THAT THE PREDICTED FAILURE MODE MAY CHANGE DRAMATICALLY DEPENDING ON INITIAL CONDITIONS, SLOPE ANGLE AND MATERIAL PROPERTIES. THE NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT, IN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, SATURATION OF THE PORE SPACE CAN BE THE UNEXPECTED RESULT OF A VOLUMETRIC INSTABILITY. ACCORDING TO THIS INTERPRETATION, A RAINFALL INDUCED FLOW SLIDE CAN ORIGINATE FROM A COMPLEX CHAIN PROCESS CONSISTING OF A SUDDEN VOLUME COLLAPSE, UNCONTROLLED SATURATION OF THE PORES AND, EVENTUALLY, CATASTROPHIC LIQUEFACTION OF THE DEPOSIT.

TUNNEL EXCAVATION AND CONSTRUCTION IS A HIGHLY COMPLEX PROCESS AND THE LINE SINK MODEL APPROACH USED IN PREVIOUS ANALYTICAL STUDIES PROVIDES A SIMPLE MEANS TO SIMULATE THE EXCAVATION PROCESS. A VIRTUAL SAND BOX WAS CREATED USING DEM AND GRAINS WERE PROGRESSIVELY DELETED TO SIMULATE THE SINK. THE SURFACE SETTLEMENT TROUGH WAS DETERMINED AND, WHEN NORMALISED BY THE MAXIMUM SETTLEMENT, ITS SHAPE WAS NEARLY CONSTANT AND CLOSELY FITTED A GAUSSIAN CURVE. THE DEFORMATIONS OBSERVED GAVE A GOOD APPROXIMATION TO THE DISPLACEMENT FIELD PREDICTED USING THE VERRUIJT AND BOOKER ANALYTICAL LINE SINK MODEL. THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY SUGGESTS THAT A SIMPLE LINE SINK DEM MAY PROVIDE A ROBUST BASIC FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR THE COMPLEX MECHANISMS OF GROUND MOVEMENT AROUND SOFT GROUND TUNNELS. MORE GENERALLY THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL OF USING PARTICULATE DEM TO STUDY GROUND RESPONSE TO TUNNELLING.

HOWEVER, THE UPSTREAM EMBANKMENT SHOULDER OF THE ORIGINAL DAM SUFFERED A DEEP SEATED FAILURE THROUGH ITS FOUNDATION TOWARDS THE END OF CONSTRUCTION IN JULY 1937, 9 DAYS BEFORE A SIMILAR AND WELL KNOWN FAILURE OCCURRED AT CHINGFORD RESERVOIR IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ABBERTON. WHEREAS THE FAILURE AT CHINGFORD BECAME AN IMPORTANT CASE IN THE HISTORY OF SOIL MECHANICS THROUGH THE INVOLVEMENT OF KARL TERZAGHI AND MARKED ONE OF THE FIRST APPLICATIONS OF MODERN SOIL MECHANICS PRINCIPLES, THE FAILURE AT ABBERTON HAS REMAINED LARGELY UNKNOWN, UNTIL RECENTLY WHEN RAISING OF THE EXISTING DAM STARTED TO BE CONSIDERED. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES ADVANCED FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSES WHICH WERE CARRIED OUT TO INVESTIGATE THE FAILURE OF THE ORIGINAL DAM AT ABBERTON AND THE STABILITY OF THE EXISTING MAIN DAM. THE PARAMETERS USED IN THE CONSTITUTIVE MODELS WERE DERIVED ON THE BASIS OF THE AVAILABLE SITE INVESTIGATIONS AND LABORATORY TESTING AND ON EXPERIENCE IN THE BACK ANALYSIS OF OTHER FAILURES IN LONDON CLAY. THE ANALYSES DEMONSTRATED THAT THE UPSTREAM SHOULDER OF THE ORIGINAL EMBANKMENT FAILED THROUGH THE MECHANISM OF PROGRESSIVE FAILURE, WHICH INVOLVED THE TOP OF THE STIFF PLASTIC LONDON CLAY RATHER THAN THE OVERLYING ALLUVIUM IN THE FOUNDATION. THE RELATIVELY RAPID RATE OF EMBANKMENT FILLING, ACHIEVED BY USING MODERN EARTHMOVING EQUIPMENT, CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE ORIGINAL DAM FAILURE. THE ANALYSES ALSO DEMONSTRATED SATISFACTORY BEHAVIOUR OF THE EXISTING DAM DURING RECONSTRUCTION, THE FIRST IMPOUNDING AND IN THE LONG TERM, WITH ITS RESPONSE BEING SIMILAR TO THAT OBSERVED. THUS THE CONSTITUTIVE MODELS USED AND PARAMETERS DERIVED WERE SUCCESSFULLY CALIBRATED AGAINST THE OBSERVED BEHAVIOUR OF BOTH THE ORIGINAL AND EXISTING MAIN DAMS AT ABBERTON, AND COULD BE USED IN PREDICTING THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE DAM DURING AND AFTER ITS PROPOSED RAISING.

THE HEAVE MECHANISM IS EXPLAINED BY THE PRESENCE OF CIRCULATING WATER IN THE FRACTURED ANHYDRITIC LEVEL. THE MODEL DEVELOPED TO REPRODUCE THE OBSERVED PHENOMENA INTEGRATES A SET OF BALANCE EQUATIONS THAT INCLUDES TWO SOLUBLE SPECIES (GYPSUM AND ANHYDRITE) IN ADDITION TO THE INERT MINERALS, KINETIC EQUATIONS FOR DISSOLUTION AND PRECIPITATION, MECHANICAL EQUILIBRIUM, AND THE EFFECT OF PRECIPITATED MASS ON INDUCED VOLUMETRIC STRAINS. MODEL CALCULATIONS ARE COMPARED WITH MEASURED LONG TERM FIELD RECORDS OF HEAVE. MOST OF THE MODEL PARAMETERS ARE PHYSICO CHEMICAL CONSTANTS, A POSITIVE FEATURE THAT LIMITS THE EFFORT TO CALIBRATE MATERIAL CONSTANTS. THE MODEL IS CAPABLE OF ACCURATE MID TERM HEAVE PREDICTION, AND IT ALSO CORRECTLY INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF BUILDING A SURFACE EMBANKMENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF REDUCING THE HEAVE RATE. A SENSITIVITY STUDY IS REPORTED TO ACHIEVE A DEEPER INSIGHT INTO THE PHENOMENA, AND TO INVESTIGATE THE RELEVANCE OF A FEW CONTROLLING PARAMETERS.

THESE, ESPECIALLY THE CALCARENITE, ARE AFFECTED BY WEATHERING PROCESSES THAT MARKEDLY ALTER THEIR MECHANICAL PROPERTIES WITH TIME, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO INSTABILITY OF COASTAL GEOMORPHOLOGICAL STRUCTURES. SUCH ALTERATIONS ARE MAINLY DUE TO CHEMICAL REACTIONS BETWEEN THE SOLID AND FLUID PHASES, AND ARE DRIVEN BY CHEMICAL VARIABLES, WHICH ARE INTERNAL VARIABLES AND HENCE UNCONTROLLABLE. IN A SEARCH FOR THE VARIABLES THAT DRIVE THE PROCESS OF ROCK WEAKENING, RECOURSE IS MADE TO THE MICRO SCALE, AT WHICH MOST OF THE CHEMICAL PROCESSES ARE OBSERVED AND QUANTIFIED. OBSERVATIONS USING SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSOPE, THIN SECTIONS AND X RAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY ANALYSES APPEAR TO BE CRUCIAL FOR THE UNDERSTANDING, INTERPRETATION AND DEFINITION OF THE DEGRADATION MECHANISMS OF THE MATERIAL. A CHEMO MECHANICAL COUPLED MODEL AT THE MESO SCALE OF THE CHEMICALLY REACTIVE STRESSED POROUS SYSTEM IS PRESENTED AND FRAMED IN THE CONTEXT OF A MULTI SCALE SCENARIO OF AN ARRAY OF COUPLED PHENOMENA. AN ANALOGOUS MODEL AT THE MACRO SCALE IS DEVELOPED IN PARALLEL TOGETHER WITH UPSCALING AND IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURES FOR MESO SCALE AND MACRO SCALE MATERIAL CONSTANTS. THE MAIN OUTCOME OF THE STUDY IS A TOOL FOR PREDICTING THE PROGRESS OF TIME DEPENDENT WEATHERING PHENOMENA, POTENTIALLY ALLOWING THE STABILITY OF GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURES TO BE ASSESSED AS IT EVOLVES WITH A PROGRESSING CHEMICAL DEGRADATION IN A SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION AND UNDER A SPECIFIC SET OF LOADS.

WHEN THIS OCCURS ON EXISTING TRACK WHICH HAS NOT BEEN DESIGNED FOR SUCH LOADING THERE CAN BE INCREASED RATES OF BALLAST DEGRADATION, CHARACTERISED BY UNACCEPTABLE DEFORMATION AND LATERAL SPREAD, LEADING TO MORE FREQUENT REQUIREMENTS FOR TRACK MAINTENANCE. RECENT STUDIES CARRIED OUT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WOLLONGONG HIGHLIGHTED THAT CONFINING PRESSURE AND FREQUENCY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE PERMANENT DEFORMATION AND DEGRADATION OF BALLAST. HOWEVER, CONFINEMENT REQUIRED TO KEEP THE DEFORMATION AND DEGRADATION OF THE BALLASTED TRACK TO AN ACCEPTABLE LIMIT WILL DEPEND ON THE TRAIN SPEED (FREQUENCY). IN THIS CONTEXT, A SERIES OF CYCLIC TRIAXIAL TESTS WAS CONDUCTED ON LATITE BASALT SAMPLES HAVING AN INITIAL CONFINING PRESSURE OF 120 KPA. AFTER EVERY 25 000 CYCLES, THE CONFINING PRESSURE WAS DECREASED IN STEPS TO SIMULATE THE DROP OF CONFINING PRESSURE DURING HEAVY TRAFFIC. THIS TEST PROCEDURE WAS ADOPTED TO REPLICATE THE INFLUENCE OF TRAIN SPEED ON THE STABILITY OF BALLAST. TEST RESULTS INDICATED THAT BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND CONFINING PRESSURE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE PERMANENT DEFORMATION OF BALLAST. RESILIENT MODULUS IS FOUND TO INCREASE WITH AN INCREASE IN CONFINING PRESSURE AND NUMBER OF CYCLES, BUT TO DECREASE WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY. THE RESULTS ALSO SHOWED THAT THE BALLAST LAYER REQUIRES A MINIMUM LEVEL OF CONFINEMENT FOR PREVENTING AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF TRACK DEFORMATION. AN EMPIRICAL EQUATION IS FORMULATED TO DETERMINE THE REQUIRED CONFINING PRESSURE AND RESILIENT MODULUS OF THE BALLAST LAYER FOR AN ALLOWABLE LIMIT OF TRACK DEFORMATION AT A GIVEN TRAIN SPEED.

THE RESULTS OF THE THREE NUMERICAL METHODS ARE SHOWN TO BE IN EXCELLENT AGREEMENT, WHILE THE ANALYTICAL SOLUTION PRESENTS A THEORETICAL UPPER BOUND THAT IS VERY CLOSE TO THE NUMERICAL RESULTS. THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSES ARE USED TO IDENTIFY THE PREDOMINANT FAILURE MECHANISMS FOR DIFFERENT PILE SPACINGS AND PILE SOIL ADHESIONS. THEY ARE ALSO USED TO DEVELOP A DESIGN CHART AND DESIGN EQUATIONS FOR DETERMINATION OF THE ULTIMATE LATERAL BEARING CAPACITY FACTOR.

THE MODEL USES AN UPPER BOUND ENERGY APPROACH WITH CONTOURS OF CONSTANT SOIL DISPLACEMENT TAKEN TO BE ELLIPSOIDAL WITHIN A HEMISPHERICAL OUTER BOUNDARY. THE ELASTIC AND PLASTIC WORK DONE WITHIN THE SOIL ARE EQUATED TO THE FOOTING WORK, WITH YIELD BEING DEFINED USING THE VON MISES YIELD CRITERION. IT IS SHOWN THAT, FOR TWO DIFFERENT SOIL RIGIDITIES, RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OBTAINED FROM FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSES AVAILABLE IN THE LITERATURE.

PILLARS WERE FOUNDED ON 3 3 3 PILE GROUPS CAPPED BY A RIGID SLAB. THE TIPS OF PILES SUPPORTING THE CENTRAL PILLARS REACHED A HARD TERTIARY ANHYDRITIC CLAYSTONE. DEEP EXTENSOMETERS ALLOWED THE IDENTIFICATION OF AN ACTIVE LAYER, 12 15 M THICK, LOCATED BELOW THE PILE TIPS. OBSERVATIONS IN RECOVERED CORES SUGGEST THAT THE HEAVE IS INDUCED BY THE GROWTH OF GYPSUM CRYSTALS IN DISCONTINUITIES OF THE ANHYDRITIC CLAYSTONE. NO HEAVE WAS OBSERVED IN GYPSUM RICH CLAYSTONES LOCATED ABOVE THE ANHYDRITIC LAYER. GYPSUM CRYSTAL GROWTH IS ASSOCIATED WITH DISSOLUTION OF ANHYDRITE AND SUBSEQUENT PRECIPITATION FROM A SUPER SATURATED AQUEOUS SOLUTION. BOREHOLES AND PILE CONSTRUCTION ALLOWED A HYDRAULIC CONNECTION OF UPPER AQUIFERS AND THE LOWER ANHYDRITIC FORMATION. THIS HYPOTHESIS EXPLAINS THE ROLE OF THE BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION IN THE TRIGGERING OF A DORMANT HEAVE PHENOMENON. THE HEAVE RATE HAS BEEN REDUCED TO A SMALL VALUE BY THE WEIGHT ADDED BY AN EMBANKMENT 33 M HIGH, WHICH PARTIALLY FILLS THE ORIGINAL VALLEY.

UNIQUE CRITICAL STATE CHARACTERISTICS IN GRANULAR MEDIA CONSIDERING FABRIC ANISOTROPY	2013	GEOTECHNIQUE	63	8		695	704		1	HTTP://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URL?EID2 S2.0 84878088597&PARTNERID40&MD5888133A85656720BCAF79350F1310944	HONG KONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, CLEARWATER BAY, KOWLOON, HONG KONG	ZHAO, J., HONG KONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, CLEARWATER BAY, KOWLOON, HONG KONG; GUO, N., HONG KONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, CLEARWATER BAY, KOWLOON, HONG KONG	THE CONCEPT OF THE CRITICAL STATE IN GRANULAR SOILS NEEDS TO MAKE PROPER REFERENCE TO THE FABRIC STRUCTURE THAT DEVELOPS AT CRITICAL STATE. THIS STUDY IDENTIFIES A UNIQUE PROPERTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FABRIC STRUCTURE RELATIVE TO THE STRESSES AT CRITICAL STATE. A UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MEAN EFFECTIVE STRESS AND A FABRIC ANISOTROPY PARAMETER, K, DEFINED BY THE FIRST JOINT INVARIANT OF THE DEVIATORIC STRESS TENSOR AND THE DEVIATORIC FABRIC TENSOR, IS FOUND AT CRITICAL STATE, AND IS PATH INDEPENDENT. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS USING THE DISCRETE ELEMENT METHOD UNDER DIFFERENT LOADING CONDITIONS AND INTERMEDIATE PRINCIPAL STRESS RATIOS IDENTIFY A UNIQUE POWER LAW FOR THIS RELATIONSHIP. BASED ON THE FINDINGS, A NEW DEFINITION OF CRITICAL STATE FOR GRANULAR MEDIA IS PROPOSED. IN ADDITION TO THE CONDITIONS OF CONSTANT STRESS AND UNIQUE VOID RATIO REQUIRED BY THE CONVENTIONAL CRITICAL STATE CONCEPT, THE NEW DEFINITION IMPOSES THE ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINT THAT K REACHES A UNIQUE VALUE AT CRITICAL STATE. A UNIQUE SPATIAL CRITICAL STATE CURVE IN THE THREE DIMENSIONAL SPACE K E P IS FOUND FOR A GRANULAR MEDIUM, THE PROJECTION OF WHICH ONTO THE E P PLANE TURNS OUT TO BE THE CONVENTIONAL CRITICAL STATE LINE. THE NEW CRITICAL STATE CONCEPT PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT REFERENCE STATE FOR A SOIL TO REACH, BASED ON WHICH THE KEY CONCEPTS IN THE CONSTITUTIVE MODELLING OF GRANULAR MEDIA, INCLUDING THE CHOICE OF STATE PARAMETERS, DILATANCY RELATION AND NON COAXIALITY, ARE REASSESSED, AND FUTURE EXPLORATORY TOPICS ARE DISCUSSED.

AS PART OF THE RESEARCH, A TRIAXIAL SYSTEM WAS DEVELOPED THAT INCORPORATES SMALL STRAIN MEASUREMENTS USING HALL EFFECT TRANSDUCERS, IN ADDITION TO SUCTION MEASUREMENTS TAKEN USING A PSYCHROMETER. TESTS WERE CONDUCTED ON SAMPLES OF KAOLIN UNDER CONSTANT WATER MASS CONDITIONS. THE RESULTS ADDRESS THE EFFECTS OF COMPACTION EFFORT AND WATER CONTENT AT THE TIME OF COMPACTION ON THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF UNSATURATED SOILS, UNDER DIFFERENT AMPLITUDES OF LOADING AND DIFFERENT CONFINING PRESSURES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT SUCTION IN THE SAMPLE REDUCED WITH INCREASING NUMBER OF LOADING CYCLES OF THE SAME MAGNITUDE. THE RESILIENT MODULUS INITIALLY INCREASED WITH INCREASING WATER CONTENT UP TO APPROXIMATELY OPTIMUM WATER CONTENT, AND THEN REDUCED SUBSTANTIALLY WITH FURTHER INCREASE IN WATER CONTENT.

DESPITE THIS, THERE IS NO WELL ACCEPTED SOLUTION FOR THIS VERY COMMON PROBLEM. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT PAPER IS TO ADDRESS THIS BY PRESENTING A SOIL MODEL THAT IS SIMPLE ENOUGH TO BE APPLIED IN ROUTINE ENGINEERING PRACTICE, BUT SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH TO CAPTURE THE IMPORTANT MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF SANDS RELEVANT TO THE FOOTING SETTLEMENT PROBLEM. EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON THE APPLICATION OF THE MODEL BY PRESENTING DETAILS OF THE PROCESS ADOPTED FOR DERIVING MODEL PARAMETERS PRIOR TO BACK ANALYSING FOUNDATION LOAD TESTS.

IN THIS PAPER, THE SWELLING BEHAVIOUR IS SIMULATED USING THE DISCRETE ELEMENT METHOD (DEM). THE INTERPARTICLE FORCES INCLUDE MECHANICAL, ATTRACTIVE (VAN DER WAALS), AND REPULSIVE (DOUBLE LAYER AND INTERLAYER) FORCES. EXCEPT FOR THE INTERLAYER REPULSION, RATIONAL FORCE DISPLACEMENT RELATIONS HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED IN PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS. A SYSTEMATIC MOLECULAR DYNAMIC STUDY HAS RECENTLY BEEN COMPLETED TO ESTABLISH THE INTERLAYER FORCE DISPLACEMENT RELATION. THESE RELATIONS ARE SYNTHESISED INTO A DEM STUDY IN THE PRESENT PAPER. NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS ARE CONDUCTED BY FIRST FORMING DRY POWDER ASSEMBLIES AND THEN SATURATING THEM UNDER CONSTANT VOLUME. THE CHANGES IN INTERNAL FABRIC AND THE SWELLING PRESSURES DEVELOPING ON THE WALLS ARE EVALUATED. IT IS FOUND THAT PARTICLES EXPAND AND FILL UP THE INTERPARTICLE PORE SPACES. THE PREDICTED RELATION OF VOID RATIO AGAINST SWELLING PRESSURE IS FOUND TO BE REASONABLY CLOSE TO THAT EXPERIMENTALLY MEASURED BY OTHERS IN THE PAST. THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT THE CRYSTALLINE SWELLING INFLUENCES SWELLING PRESSURE VALUES ONLY WHEN THE VOID RATIO IS SMALLER THAN A CERTAIN VALUE.

THESE METHODS, KNOWN AS FINITE ELEMENT LIMIT ANALYSIS, DO NOT REQUIRE ASSUMPTIONS TO BE MADE ABOUT THE MODE OF FAILURE, AND USE ONLY SIMPLE STRENGTH PARAMETERS THAT ARE FAMILIAR TO GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERS. THE BOUNDING PROPERTIES OF THE SOLUTIONS ARE INVALUABLE IN PRACTICE, AND ENABLE ACCURATE LIMIT LOADS TO BE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF AN EXACT ERROR ESTIMATE AND AUTOMATIC ADAPTIVE MESHING PROCEDURES. THE METHODS ARE VERY GENERAL, AND CAN DEAL WITH HETEROGENEOUS SOIL PROFILES, ANISOTROPIC STRENGTH CHARACTERISTICS, FISSURED SOILS, DISCONTINUITIES, COMPLICATED BOUNDARY CONDITIONS, AND COMPLEX LOADING IN BOTH TWO AND THREE DIMENSIONS. A NEW DEVELOPMENT, WHICH INCORPORATES PORE WATER PRESSURES IN FINITE ELEMENT LIMIT ANALYSIS, IS ALSO DESCRIBED. FOLLOWING A BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE NEW TECHNIQUES, STABILITY SOLUTIONS ARE GIVEN FOR SEVERAL PRACTICAL PROBLEMS, INCLUDING FOUNDATIONS, ANCHORS, SLOPES, EXCAVATIONS AND TUNNELS.

AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS PROBLEM IS THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE PERMEABILITY OF THE GROUT BETWEEN THE LINING AND THE SOIL. THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF TESTS TO CHARACTERISE THE PROPERTIES OF GROUT SAMPLES FROM LONDON UNDERGROUND TUNNELS, INVESTIGATING PERMEABILITY, POROSITY, MICRO STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION. THE TESTS REVEALED THAT THE NEWER GROUT WAS IMPERMEABLE RELATIVE TO THE SURROUNDING CLAY. HOWEVER, THE OLDER SAMPLES SHOWED MUCH GREATER PERMEABILITIES AND AN ALTERED GROUT COMPOSITION, SUGGESTING THAT DEGRADATION HAD TAKEN PLACE. EXPOSURE TO GROUNDWATER APPEARED TO HAVE CAUSED CARBONATION AND SULFATE REACTION. THE COMBINATION OF CHEMICAL REACTION AND LEACHING OF CEMENTITIOUS AND DEGRADATION PRODUCTS APPEARS TO HAVE MADE THESE GROUTS MORE PERMEABLE, SO THAT THE GROUT COULD ACT AS A DRAINAGE PATH RATHER THAN A BARRIER. THIS CHALLENGES THE TYPICAL ASSUMPTION THAT THE GROUT ACTS AS AN IMPERMEABLE BARRIER.

THE GEOLOGY OF THE SITE AND THE PERFORMANCE OF ALTERNATIVE SUPPORT DESIGNS ARE DESCRIBED. FIELD OBSERVATIONS ARE ANALYSED TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSES OF THE OBSERVED SWELLING. IT WAS FOUND THAT LONG TERM SWELLING IN LILLA TUNNEL WAS THE RESULT OF GYPSUM CRYSTAL GROWTH IN DISCONTINUITIES. THE PHENOMENON WAS A CONSEQUENCE OF A FEW CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE OF ANHYDRITE, EXISTENT OR ACTIVATED DISCONTINUITIES, AND THE CIRCULATION OF WATER. THESE CONDITIONS WERE PRESENT IN THE HIGHLY TECTONISED TERTIARY CLAYSTONE IN LILLA. THE ORIGINAL HORSESHOE CROSS SECTION WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A CIRCULAR ONE, AND A REINFORCED CONCRETE LINING WAS BUILT TO RESIST SWELLING PRESSURES. LONG TERM MONITORING OF THE REINFORCED TUNNEL PROVIDED VALUABLE DATA ON THE EVOLUTION OF SWELLING PRESSURES AGAINST THE LINING, AND ON THE STRESSES DEVELOPED IN THE RESISTING STRUCTURE. THE HIGHLY HETEROGENEOUS DISTRIBUTION OF SWELLING PRESSURES AGAINST THE LINING EXPLAINS THE LOW STRAINS MEASURED IN REINFORCEMENT BARS DESPITE THE VERY HIGH MAXIMUM SWELLING PRESSURES RECORDED.

THIS PAPER REPORTS THE RESULTS FROM LARGE DEFORMATION FINITE ELEMENT (LDFE) ANALYSIS UNDERTAKEN TO PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO BALL PENETROMETER BEHAVIOUR DURING UNDRAINED VERTICAL PENETRATION THROUGH UNIFORM AND STRATIFIED CLAY DEPOSITS. THE LDFE ANALYSES SIMULATED CONTINUOUS PENETRATION OF BALL PENETROMETERS FROM THE SEABED SURFACE. THE RESULTS WERE VALIDATED AGAINST CENTRIFUGE TEST DATA AND PLASTICITY SOLUTIONS PRIOR TO UNDERTAKING A DETAILED PARAMETRIC STUDY, EXPLORING A RANGE OF NORMALISED SOIL PROPERTIES AND LAYER THICKNESSES AND ROUGHNESSES OF THE SOIL/BALL INTERFACE. THE INFLUENCE OF THE SHAFT (OR AREA RATIO) WAS ALSO IDENTIFIED. THE EVOLVING SOIL FAILURE PATTERNS IN SINGLE AND DOUBLE LAYER SOILS REVEALED TWO INTERESTING ASPECTS: SOIL BACKFLOW ABOVE THE PENETROMETER, AND TRAPPING OF THE STRONGER MATERIAL BENEATH THE PENETROMETER. A FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE EFFECTS, WHICH WILL ALLOW ACCURATE INTERPRETATION OF SOIL UNDRAINED SHEAR STRENGTH FROM THE BALL PENETRATION RESISTANCE.

ALTHOUGH THE PERFORMANCE OF FOUNDATIONS ON A HOMOGENEOUS SAND OR CLAY SLOPE IS ROUTINELY CALCULATED AND INVESTIGATED, COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION OF A THIN, STRONGER SLOPE OVERLYING A SOFTER LAYER IS SCARCE. THIS PAPER REPORTS THE RESULTS OF CENTRIFUGE MODEL TESTS UNDERTAKEN TO PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO STRIP FOUNDATION BEHAVIOUR DURING PENETRATION, WITH FREEDOM IN HORIZONTAL DISPLACEMENT AND ROTATION, ADJACENT TO A SAND EMBANKMENT (COVER LAYER), INTO A WEAKER CLAY LAYER (REPRESENTING MINE TAILINGS). VARIABLES WERE THE SET BACK OF THE EDGE OF THE FOUNDATION FROM THE CREST OF THE SLOPE, THE HEIGHT OF THE SLOPE RELATIVE TO THE FOUNDATION SIZE, AND THE NORMALISED STRENGTH OF THE LOWER CLAY LAYER. SOIL MOVEMENT WAS CAPTURED CONTINUOUSLY BY A DIGITAL CAMERA, AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUANTIFIED THROUGH PARTICLE IMAGE VELOCIMETRY (PIV) ANALYSIS. THE LOAD PENETRATION RESPONSES WERE SEPARATELY RECORDED. THE EFFECT OF NORMALISED SET BACK RATIO (LAMBDA B/B), SLOPE HEIGHT (ETA/ H/B) AND CLAY STRENGTH (SUS/GAMMACB) ON THE EVOLVING SOIL FLOW MECHANISMS AND THE PENETRATION RESISTANCE PROFILE IS DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE LIKELIHOOD AND SEVERITY OF FAILURE. ROTATIONAL FAILURE, WITH A PEAK IN PENETRATION RESISTANCE FOLLOWED BY SOME REDUCTION, OCCURRED FOR ALL CASES INVESTIGATED EXCEPT FOR A HIGHER SET BACK OF LAMBDA 1.5. THE SEVERITY OF FAILURE WAS GREATER THE CLOSER THE PROXIMITY OF THE FOOTING TO THE SLOPE CREST, AND THE GREATER THE HEIGHT OF THE SLOPE, WHEREAS IT REDUCED AS THE NORMALISED STRENGTH OF THE LOWER LAYER INCREASED. TYPICAL CRITICAL FAILURE OCCURRED IN CLEAR SHEAR PLANES PUSHING A (NOMINALLY) RIGID BLOCK OF SOIL, WITH THE SHAPE OF A HEMISPHERE FOLLOWED BY A WEDGE, TOWARDS THE SLOPE.

SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS OF THE LAND MOTION CAN HELP IMPROVE THIS INFORMATION. THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATES THE GROUND RESPONSE DUE TO UNDERGROUND GAS STORAGE ACTIVITIES AS REVEALED BY SATELLITE INTERFEROMETRIC MEASUREMENTS IN THREE GAS FIELDS OF THE PO RIVER BASIN, ITALY. THE GROUND PROVES TO BEHAVE ELASTICALLY, MOVING UPWARDS AND DOWNWARDS IN RESPONSE TO GAS INJECTION AND EXTRACTION, RESPECTIVELY. THE ACCURATE CALIBRATION OF A DETAILED GEOMECHANICAL, TRANSVERSELY ISOTROPIC, FINITE ELEMENT MODEL ALLOWS FOR AN INDIRECT ESTIMATE OF THE VERTICAL GROUND COMPRESSIBILITY IN UNLOADING/RELOADING CONDITIONS, WHICH PROVES CONSISTENT WITH THE RESULTS ALREADY AVAILABLE FROM THE SAME BASIN. ASSUMING A HYPO PLASTIC CONSTITUTIVE MODEL FOR THE COMPRESSIBILITY IN VIRGIN LOADING CONDITIONS, THE RATIO BETWEEN I CYCLE AND II CYCLE COMPRESSIBILITY AT THE LOAD INVERSION TURNS OUT TO BE BETWEEN 3.5 AND 40 IN THE DEPTH RANGE 1100 1500 M, AGAIN PROVING TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH OTHER RESULTS OBTAINED IN THE SAME BASIN.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

AN EFFICIENT OPTIMISATION METHOD IS SIMULTANEOUSLY EMPLOYED TO FIND THE LEAST UPPER BOUNDS TO THE CRITICAL HEIGHT IN ORDER TO AVOID MISSING THE GLOBAL MINIMUM. COMPARED WITH THE RESULTS FROM ANALYSIS BASED ON TOE FAILURE ALONE, BEST ESTIMATES OF THE CRITICAL HEIGHT AND THE CRITICAL FAILURE MECHANISM ARE OBTAINED. THE CALCULATED RESULTS ARE GIVEN IN THE FORM OF GRAPHS AND TABLES FOR A WIDE RANGE OF PARAMETERS. THE CRITICAL FAILURE SURFACES ARE ALSO INVESTIGATED TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCES OF GEOMETRICAL CONSTRAINT AND SOIL PROPERTY ON FAILURE MECHANISM.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

THE ENGINEERING PROPERTIES OF COMPACTED SOILS ARE DESCRIBED BY AN INITIAL STATE IN TERMS OF A YIELDING STRESS, SOIL SUCTION AND A MICROSTRUCTURAL STATE VARIABLE. MICROSTRUCTURE IS DEFINED BY THE RATIO OF MICROVOID VOLUME TO TOTAL VOID VOLUME. THE PATTERN OF VARIATION OF THE MICROSTRUCTURAL PARAMETER WITHIN THE COMPACTION PLANE HAS BEEN DETERMINED, FOR SOME COMPACTED SOILS, BY ANALYSING MERCURY INTRUSION POROSIMETRY DATA. THE MICRO STRUCTURE OF WET AND DRY COMPACTION CONDITIONS CAN THEN BE QUANTIFIED. TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY, THE FRAMEWORK IS CAST IN THE FORM OF A CONSTITUTIVE MODEL DEFINED IN TERMS OF AN EFFECTIVE SUCTION AND A CONSTITUTIVE STRESS THAT INCORPORATE THE MICROSTRUCTURAL VARIABLE. THE MODEL IS SHOWN TO BE CONSISTENT WITH A NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS AND, IN PARTICULAR, IT EXPLAINS THE INTRINSIC COLLAPSE POTENTIAL OF COMPACTED SOILS. IT PREDICTS, FOR A COMMON INITIAL SUCTION, A HIGHER COLLAPSE POTENTIAL FOR DRY OF OPTIMUM CONDITIONS THAN FOR WET COMPACTION. IT ALSO PREDICTS IN A NATURAL MANNER THE OBSERVED EVOLUTION OF SOIL COMPRESSIBILITY DURING DRAINED OR UNDRAINED LOADING. MODEL CAPABILITIES ARE ILLUSTRATED BY APPLICATION TO A TESTING PROGRAMME ON STATICALLY COMPACTED SAMPLES OF LOW PLASTICITY SILTY CLAY. THE COMPRESSION BEHAVIOUR OF SAMPLES COMPACTED WET AND DRY OF OPTIMUM AND THE VARIATION OF COLLAPSE STRAINS WITH CONFINING STRESS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY REPRODUCED BY THE MODEL.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

INTERNAL ROTATIONAL FAILURE CAN DEGENERATE TO A TRANSLATIONAL ONE SHOULD IT BE MORE CRITICAL; HOWEVER, THE REVERSE IS NOT TRUE, WHICH MAKES ROTATIONAL FAILURE A MORE GENERIC MECHANISM. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, THIS PAPER PRESENTS A NEW ANALYTICAL NUMERICAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE DISPLACEMENT BASED DESIGN OF GRESS, WHICH ASSESSES THE POTENTIAL FOR EARTHQUAKE INDUCED DISPLACEMENTS VIA AN INTERNAL STABILITY (ROTATIONAL) FAILURE MECHANISM. FOR DESIGN PURPOSES, IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE SUPERIMPOSED FORCE IN THE REINFORCEMENT DUE TO SEISMICITY AND ITS ASSOCIATED DISPLACEMENT, THE PROPOSED APPROACH EXAMINES TWO LIMITING CONDITIONS: (A) THE UPPER BOUND FORCE THAT CAN BE MOBILISED IN THE REINFORCEMENT, AS DETERMINED BY PSEUDO STATIC LIMIT EQUILIBRIUM; AND (B) THE FORCE THAT CAN BE INDUCED IN THE REINFORCEMENT BY A GIVEN EARTHQUAKE ACCELERATION APPLIED OVER A FINITE TIME INCREMENT. EITHER CONDITION SATISFIES EQUILIBRIUM. THE PREVAILING SEISMICALLY INDUCED FORCE AND DISPLACEMENT IN THE REINFORCEMENT FOR EACH TIME INCREMENT ARE DETERMINED BY SELECTING THE SMALLER VALUE THAT RESULTS FROM THESE TWO CONDITIONS. AS AN AUXILIARY TOOL, A SET OF PULLOUT SIMULATIONS WAS PERFORMED USING FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS IN ORDER TO RELATE THE FORCE AND DISPLACEMENT IN THE GEOSYNTHETIC REINFORCEMENT FOR VARIOUS GEOSYNTHETIC STIFFNESSES. TO ILLUSTRATE THE APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED METHOD, A DESIGN EXAMPLE USING A KOBE EARTHQUAKE RECORD IS PRESENTED. FOR THIS EXAMPLE, THE SUPERIMPOSED FORCE IN THE REINFORCEMENT DUE TO SEISMICITY, THE SEISMIC DISPLACEMENT, AND THE SEISMIC ROTATION ARE CALCULATED. THE REQUIRED UNFACTORED GEOSYNTHETIC STRENGTH IS THEN DETERMINED USING A UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF DEEP OCEAN CLAY CRUST FROM THE GULF OF GUINEA	2013	GEOTECHNIQUE	63	6		500	509		1	HTTP://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URL?EID2 S2.0 84878057196&PARTNERID40&MD576940BE6EABAEEFDDD1390C8CC044DBD	DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING, CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM; SCHOFIELD CENTRE, CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM	KUO, M., DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING, CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM; BOLTON, M., SCHOFIELD CENTRE, CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM	DEEP OCEAN SEDIMENTS OFF THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA EXHIBIT A PECULIAR UNDRAINED STRENGTH PROFILE IN THE FORM OF A CRUST, ALBEIT OF EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH WATER CONTENT, OVERLYING NORMALLY CONSOLIDATED CLAY. HOT OIL PIPELINES ARE INSTALLED INTO THESE CRUSTAL SEDIMENTS, SO THEIR ORIGINS AND CHARACTERISTICS ARE OF GREAT INTEREST TO PIPELINE DESIGNERS. THIS PAPER PROVIDES EVIDENCE FOR THE PRESENCE OF BURROWING INVERTEBRATES IN CRUST MATERIAL, AND FOR THE WAY SEDIMENT PROPERTIES ARE MODIFIED THROUGH THEIR CREATION OF BURROWS, AND THROUGH THE DEPOSITION OF FAECAL PELLETS. A VARIETY OF IMAGING TECHNIQUES ARE USED TO MAKE THESE CONNECTIONS, INCLUDING PHOTOGRAPHY, SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AND X RAY COMPUTER TOMOGRAPHY. HOWEVER, THE ESSENTIAL INVESTIGATIVE TECHNOLOGY IS SIMPLY THE WET SIEVING OF NATURAL CORES, WHICH REVEALS THAT UP TO 60% BY DRY MASS OF THE CRUSTAL MATERIAL CAN CONSIST OF SMOOTH, HIGHLY REGULAR, SAND SIZED CAPSULES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE FAECAL PELLETS OF INVERTEBRATES SUCH AS POLYCHAETES. MECHANICAL TESTS REVEAL THAT THESE PELLETS ARE QUITE ROBUST UNDER EFFECTIVE STRESSES OF THE ORDER OF 10 KPA, ACTING LIKE SAND GRAINS WITHIN A MATRIX OF FINES. THEIR ABUNDANCE CORRELATES CLOSELY WITH THE MEASURED STRENGTH OF THE CRUST. WHILE THIS CAN EASILY BE ACCEPTED IN THE CONTEXT OF A PELLET FRACTION AS HIGH AS 60%, THE QUESTION ARISES HOW A SMALLER PROPORTION OF PELLETS, SUCH AS 20%, IS APPARENTLY ABLE TO ENHANCE SIGNIFICANTLY THE STRENGTH OF A SEDIMENT THAT OTHERWISE APPEARS TO BE NORMALLY CONSOLIDATED. A HYPOTHESIS IS SUGGESTED BASED ON THE COMPOSITION OF THE MATRIX OF FINES AROUND THE PELLETS. THESE APPEAR TO CONSIST OF AGGLOMERATES OF CLAY PLATELETS, WHICH MAY BE THE RESULT OF THE BREAKDOWN OF PELLETS BY OTHER ORGANISMS. THEIR CONTINUED DEGRADATION AT DEPTHS IN EXCESS OF 1 M IS TAKEN TO EXPLAIN THE PROGRESSIVE LOSS OF CRUSTAL STRENGTH THEREAFTER.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

UP UNTIL NOW THERE HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY FEW ATTEMPTS TO DESCRIBE THIS FABRIC QUANTITATIVELY. MUCH OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE LINK BETWEEN THE PARTICLE MOVEMENTS AND INTERACTIONS AND THE MACRO SCALE RESPONSE OF GRANULAR MATERIALS, INCLUDING SAND, COMES FROM DISCRETE ELEMENT MODELLING AND EXPERIMENTS ON ANALOGUE SANDS WITH SIMPLE, IDEALISED SHAPES. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES METHODS OF QUANTIFYING THE DIRECTIONAL FABRIC OF A REAL SAND AND ITS EVOLUTION UNDER LOADING. STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF FABRIC DIRECTIONAL DATA IN TERMS OF PARTICLE, CONTACT NORMAL, BRANCH VECTOR AND VOID ORIENTATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF SHEARING DEFORMATION. THE DATA SHOW THAT THE INITIAL PARTICLE ORIENTATION FABRIC THAT DEVELOPS DURING THE DEPOSITION OF THE MATERIAL TENDS TO PERSIST DURING SHEARING, WHILE IN THE POST PEAK REGIME THE CONTACT NORMALS SEEM TO BE REORIENTED ALONG THE DIRECTION OF THE MAJOR PRINCIPAL STRESS. DIFFERENT PATTERNS WERE OBSERVED WITHIN THE SHEAR BAND, AS BOTH THE PARTICLES AND THE CONTACT NORMAL VECTORS APPEARED TO ROTATE ALONG THE SHEAR PLANE.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

THE THREAD ROLLING TEST WAS STANDARDISED AT THE US PUBLIC ROADS BUREAU IN THE 1920S AND 1930S, AND HAS SUBSEQUENTLY BECOME ONE OF THE STANDARD TESTS OF SOIL MECHANICS. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE ORIGINAL DEFINITIONS OF PLASTIC LIMIT AS PROPOSED BY ATTERBERG, AND PROPOSES THAT THE BRITTLE FAILURE OBSERVED IN THE PLASTIC LIMIT TEST IS CAUSED BY EITHER AIR ENTRY OR CAVITATION IN THE CLAY. CRITICAL STATE SOIL MECHANICS IS USED TO SHOW THAT THE OBSERVED RANGE OF UNDRAINED SHEAR STRENGTHS OF SOILS AT PLASTIC LIMIT IS CONSISTENT WITH THIS HYPOTHESIS. THE FALLACY THAT STRENGTH AT PLASTIC LIMIT IS A CONSTANT IS HIGHLIGHTED, AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR GEOTECHNICAL PRACTICE ARE DISCUSSED.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

L., INSTITUTE OF GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING, COLLEGE OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, FUZHOU UNIVERSITY, FUZHOU, CHINA	ISOTROPICALLY CONSOLIDATED UNDRAINED TRIAXIAL COMPRESSION SHEAR TESTS WERE PERFORMED ON THREE RECONSTITUTED CLAYS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF INITIAL WATER CONTENT W0 ON UNDRAINED STRENGTH BEHAVIOUR. THE VALUES OF W0 WERE ADJUSTED WITHIN THE RANGE OF 10 20 TIMES THE LIQUID LIMIT. THE PREDOMINANT CLAY MINERAL IS IDENTIFIED AS ILLITE FOR THE CONSIDERED CLAYS, BASED ON A SEMI QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE X RAY DIFFRACTION PATTERNS. THE LABORATORY TESTS SHOW THAT THE STRESS STRAIN CURVE IN TERMS OF DEVIATOR STRESS AGAINST AXIAL STRAIN AND THE EFFECTIVE STRESS PATH IN TERMS OF DEVIATOR STRESS AGAINST EFFECTIVE MEAN STRESS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY W0. THE UNDRAINED STRENGTH RATIO R*SU, DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF THE UNDRAINED SHEAR STRENGTH S*U TO THE ISOTROPIC CONSOLIDATION STRESS, VARIES WITH W0 WITHIN A WIDE SPECTRUM, RANGING FROM 0. 28 TO 0. 60 FOR THE THREE RECONSTITUTED CLAYS INVESTIGATED. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VOID INDEX IV AND S*U CHANGES WITH R*SU, AND BECOMES IDENTICAL TO THE INTRINSIC STRENGTH LINE PROPOSED BY CHANDLER WHEN R*SU 0.33. IT IS ALSO EVIDENCED FROM THE LABORATORY TESTS THAT THE VALUE OF S*U DEPENDS ON BOTH THE WATER CONTENT AND THE LIQUID LIMIT.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

FOLLOWING THE RIGOROUS DEFINITIONS FOR THE MEAN AND DEVIATOR STRESSES AND THEREFORE AN EXACT CONSTITUTIVE RELATIONSHIP, THE PROBLEM IS FORMULATED AS A SET OF FIRST ORDER SIMULTANEOUS DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS IN THE PLASTIC ZONE WITH THE AID OF AN AUXILIARY VARIABLE. THE SOLUTION PROCEDURE PROPOSED HAS THE ADVANTAGE OVER THE CONVENTIONAL SIMILARITY METHOD IN THAT IT IS DIRECTLY APPLICABLE TO THE CAVITY EXPANSION PROBLEM OF FINITE INITIAL RADIUS. ALSO THE SOLUTION DERIVED IS SUFFICIENTLY GENERAL TO BE APPLIED TO A MORE REALISTIC SITUATION OF NON ISOTROPIC IN SITU STRESS CONDITION AND TO THE CAVITY CONTRACTION PROBLEM. EXTENSIVE PARAMETRIC STUDIES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT TO ILLUSTRATE THE EFFECT OF THE OVERCONSOLIDATION RATIO ON THE CAVITY EXPANSION AND STRESS DISTRIBUTIONS AROUND THE CAVITY, AS WELL AS ON THE STRESS PATH AND SPECIFIC VOLUME CHANGE DUE TO EXPANSION. THE PRESENT SOLUTION CAN AND IS USED HERE AS A BENCHMARK FOR NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS OF CAVITY EXPANSION IN MODIFIED CAM CLAY SOIL USING ABAQUS, THE FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS COMMERCIAL PROGRAM.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

CLAY AND SILT), IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR TRACK DETERIORATION. FOULING CAUSES DIFFERENTIAL SETTLEMENT OF THE TRACK, AND ALSO DECREASES THE LOAD BEARING CAPACITY, OWING TO THE REDUCTION IN THE FRICTION ANGLE OF THE GRANULAR ASSEMBLY. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, FOULED BALLAST NEEDS TO BE CLEANED OR REPLACED TO MAINTAIN THE DESIRED TRACK STIFFNESS, LOAD BEARING CAPACITY AND TRACK ALIGNMENT, ALL OF WHICH INFLUENCE SAFETY. THIS PAPER PRESENTS AND DISCUSSES THE RESULTS OF A SERIES OF LARGE SCALE TRIAXIAL TESTS CONDUCTED ON LATITE BASALT, A RAIL BALLAST OF VOLCANIC ORIGIN, COMMONLY USED IN AUSTRALIA. CONSOLIDATED DRAINED TRIAXIAL TESTS WERE CONDUCTED UNDER THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CONFINING PRESSURE AND VARYING DEGREES OF CLAY FOULING. STRESS STRAIN DEGRADATION CHARACTERISTICS ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. THIS PAPER ALSO DESCRIBES THE NON LINEAR STRENGTH ENVELOPE AND A NOVEL EMPIRICAL RELATIONSHIP TO CAPTURE THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF CLAY FOULING ON THE PERFORMANCE OF BALLASTED TRACKS.

IN THIS PAPER AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE AXIAL LOAD TRANSFER DURING A LIQUEFACTION EVENT BASED ON DYNAMIC CENTRIFUGE TEST RESULTS IS PRESENTED. A FREESTANDING PILE GROUP WITH THE PILE CAP CLEAR OF THE GROUND SURFACE IS CONSIDERED, TO CLARIFY THE MECHANISM OF LOAD TRANSFER. THE PILE GROUP WAS INSTRUMENTED TO MEASURE AXIAL LOADING AT SEVERAL LOCATIONS ALONG THE PILE LENGTH, AND WAS EMBEDDED IN A SATURATED SOIL PROFILE WHERE A DENSE PERMEABLE BASE LAYER WAS OVERLAIN BY A LAYER OF LOOSE, LIQUEFIABLE SAND. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT SHAFT FRICTION CONTINUES TO BE MAINTAINED DURING AN EARTHQUAKE IN BOTH LOOSE AND DENSE SOIL. IN THE CASE OF LOOSE SOILS, THE APPARENT SHAFT FRICTION CAPACITY IS PROPOSED WITH REFERENCE TO THE SHEAR TAKING PLACE AT THE PILE/SOIL INTERFACE, WHICH CAUSES A LOCAL REDUCTION IN THE PORE PRESSURES.

IN SANDY SOILS THE PIPES ARE TRENCHED USING JET TRENCHING OR PLOUGHING. IN BOTH CASES THE NATURE OF THE TRENCHING OPERATION MEANS THAT THE BACKFILL MATERIAL CAN BE PLACED OVER THE PIPE IN AN EXTREMELY LOOSE STATE. IF THE PIPE THEN UNDERGOES A SMALL DISPLACEMENT OR VIBRATION, LIQUEFACTION OF THE BACKFILL MATERIAL MAY OCCUR, AND THE RESISTANCE TO UPWARD MOVEMENT OF THE PIPE CAN BE REDUCED. TO EXPLORE THIS EXPERIMENTALLY, AN INSTRUMENTED MODEL PIPE SECTION WAS PULLED VERTICALLY UPWARDS AT DIFFERENT RATES IN VERY LOOSE, SATURATED, FINE, UNIFORM SAND (REPRESENTATIVE OF A NORTH SEA SAND). THE INSTRUMENTATION ALLOWED FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF THE FORCE ON THE PIPE SECTION AS WELL AS THE EXCESS PORE WATER PRESSURE REGIME AROUND THE PIPE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT, FOR SAND AT A RELATIVE DENSITY OF ZERO, THERE IS A REDUCTION OF CAPACITY AT THE FASTER UPLIFT RATES. A SIMPLE ANALYTICAL MODEL, USING THE VERTICAL SLIP MODEL (FOR UPLIFT RESISTANCE) MODIFIED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND DISSIPATION OF EXCESS PORE WATER PRESSURES AROUND THE PIPE, IS USED TO PREDICT THE RESULTS FROM THE EXPERIMENTS. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DESIGN OF BURIED OFFSHORE PIPELINES IN SAND ARE DISCUSSED.

THEREFORE, GROUNDWATER FLOW ANALYSIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO INVESTIGATE SLOPE STABILITY AS WELL AS PREDICT CONDITIONS CAUSED BY HEAVY RAINFALL. ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION QUALITY CAN BE GREATLY IMPROVED BY IN SITU MONITORING. IN THIS FRAMEWORK, THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE RESULTS OF AN ONGOING EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH PROJECT ON MUDFLOWS, BASED ON MONITORING OF A TEST SITE IN A TYPICAL GEOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT IN WESTERN CAMPANIA. THE SITE WAS SELECTED TO CARRY OUT EXTENSIVE LABORATORY AND IN SITU EXPERIMENTATION, CONSISTING OF FIELD MONITORING OF CLIMATIC CONDITIONS, MATRIC SUCTION AND WATER CONTENT. THE SUCTION DATA SPAN ABOUT 4 YEARS, WHILE WATER CONTENT DATA COVER ABOUT 2 YEARS. CONSIDERED TOGETHER, THESE DATA ALLOW CLEAR IDENTIFICATION OF SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS OF THE HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES IN THE SUBSOIL, WHILE GIVING INTERESTING INFORMATION ON THE HYSTERETIC HYDRAULIC BEHAVIOUR OF PYROCLASTIC SOILS. SUCTION MEASUREMENTS WERE ELABORATED TO OBTAIN GROUNDWATER HEADS IN THE SUBSOIL AND THEN EQUIPOTENTIAL LINES AND FLOW VECTORS.

THE FORMULA IS BASED ON A BREAKAGE MECHANICS MODEL THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE EVOLUTION OF THE GRAIN SIZE DISTRIBUTION (GSD) DUE TO GRAIN CRUSHING WITH ONLY PHYSICALLY MEANINGFUL PARAMETERS. THE MODEL IS INTEGRATED USING THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD TO STUDY THE PENETRATION PROBLEM. PREDICTIONS OF GSDS SURROUNDING PILES AND PILE END BEARING CAPACITIES ARE VALIDATED AGAINST EXPERIMENTS. NEXT, A PARAMETRIC STUDY IS CARRIED OUT TO QUANTIFY THE EFFECTS OF GRAIN CRUSHING ON THE BEARING CAPACITY, AND THEN TO ESTABLISH THE FORMULA.

THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE INTERPRETED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF PLASTICITY BASED FORCE RESULTANT MODELS, ESTABLISHED EARLIER UNDER 1G CONDITIONS, WITH THE AIM OF DESCRIBING CHANGES OF BEHAVIOUR BETWEEN SMALL SCALE 1G AND CENTRIFUGE MODELS. THE COMPARISON REFLECTS THE TENDENCY OF 1G BASED OBSERVATIONS TO OVERESTIMATE, ON THE UNSAFE SIDE, THE NORMALISED DEVIATORIC LOAD CAPACITY FOR LOW LEVELS OF V0/VPEAK. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE 1G BASED RESPONSE IS FOUND TO BE CONSERVATIVE COMPARED TO CENTRIFUGE OBTAINED RESPONSES FOR HIGH LEVELS OF V0/VPEAK.

ONE PARTICULAR PROBLEM IS THE EXCESSIVE SETTLEMENT THAT SUCH STRUCTURES UNDERGO AS A CONSEQUENCE OF EARTHQUAKE SHAKING. FOR DESIGN AND INSURANCE PURPOSES IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE MAGNITUDE OF THESE SETTLEMENTS. CURRENT PROCEDURES RELATE THE POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT TO FOUNDATION SIZE AND LIQUEFIABLE DEPTH. HOWEVER, THE INFLUENCE OF FOUNDATION BEARING PRESSURE IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR. IN PARTICULAR, EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS HAVE INDICATED THAT LARGE BEARING PRESSURES MAY INHIBIT LIQUEFACTION UNDERNEATH A SHALLOW FOUNDATION, RESULTING IN LOWER INDUCED SETTLEMENT. BY COLLECTING NEW DATA FROM 23 BUILDINGS THAT SUFFERED SETTLEMENT AND TILTING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SOIL LIQUEFACTION DURING THE 27 FEBRUARY 2010 MAULE EARTHQUAKE IN CHILE, THE EXISTING METHOD OF ESTIMATING LIQUEFACTION INDUCED SETTLEMENT IS REASSESSED AND SHOWN TO REQUIRE BEARING PRESSURE INFORMATION. BASED ON BOTH THE NEW AND PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE DATA, A MAXIMUM POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT BASED ON BOTH FOUNDATION AREA AND BEARING PRESSURE IS PROPOSED.

THIS TYPE OF FAILURE MODE, VERY DIFFERENT FROM STRAIN SOFTENING IN DENSE SAND, CAN LEAD TO CATASTROPHIC COLLAPSE OF EARTH STRUCTURES. AN APPROPRIATE CONSTITUTIVE MODEL IS THEREFORE NEEDED THAT CAN CAPTURE THE CORRECT FAILURE MODES AND ACCURATELY PREDICT THE STRESS STRAIN RESPONSE FOR BOTH DENSE AND LOOSE SANDS. IN THIS PAPER, A MICROMECHANICAL APPROACH DEVELOPED EARLIER FOR THE MODELLING OF GRANULAR MATERIAL BEHAVIOUR IS ADOPTED. THE CONSTITUTIVE MODEL IS UTILISED TO SIMULATE UNDRAINED TRIAXIAL, CONSTANT Q AND PROPORTIONAL STRAIN TESTS ON LOOSE SAND, AND NUMERICAL RESULTS ARE COMPARED WITH EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS. THE MODEL IS CAPABLE OF ACCURATELY REPRODUCING THE MACROSCOPIC EXPERIMENTAL TESTS, AND IS ALSO ABLE TO PROVIDE MICROSTRUCTURAL INFORMATION. THIS ENABLES THE OBSERVATION OF INSTABILITY AT THE PARTICLE SCALE, AND PROVIDES A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE LINKAGE BETWEEN PARTICLE SCALE INSTABILITY AND INSTABILITY AT THE ASSEMBLY LEVEL.

GEOTECHNICAL CENTRIFUGE TESTS WERE USED TO EVALUATE CEMENTATION INTEGRITY AND THE RESPONSE OF MICP CEMENTED SANDS TO DYNAMIC LOADING. THE CEMENTATION INTEGRITY TESTING REVEALS A CHANGE IN BEHAVIOUR FROM SOIL LIKE TO ROCK LIKE, WITH AN INCREASE IN TREATMENT LEVEL. RESULTS FROM DYNAMIC TESTING DEMONSTRATE A CLEAR INCREASE IN RESISTANCE TO LIQUEFACTION OF MICP TREATED SANDS COMPARED TO UNTREATED LOOSE SAND. THE MICP SANDS WERE TREATED TO VARYING LEVELS OF CEMENTATION (LIGHT, MODERATE AND HEAVY CEMENTATION LEVELS) AND ASSESSED USING NONDESTRUCTIVE SHEAR WAVE VELOCITY MEASUREMENTS. THE CENTRIFUGE MODELS WERE ALL SUBJECTED TO GROUND MOTIONS CONSISTING OF SINE WAVES WITH INCREASING AMPLITUDES. ACCELERATIONS PORE PRESSURES AND SETTLEMENTS WERE MEASURED IN THE SOIL DURING SHAKING, AND THE CHANGES IN SOIL BEHAVIOUR AND POST SHAKING SHEAR WAVE VELOCITY FOR SOILS PREPARED TO DIFFERENT CEMENTATION LEVELS ARE DISCUSSED. INCREASED RESISTANCE TO LIQUEFACTION WAS DEMONSTRATED WITH A DECREASE IN EXCESS PORE PRESSURE RATIOS IN THE MICP TREATED MODELS, AS WELL AS IN REDUCED POST SHAKING SETTLEMENTS; HOWEVER, SURFACE ACCELERATIONS WERE AMPLIFIED AT HEAVY LEVELS OF CEMENTATION. A TRADEOFF BETWEEN IMPROVING LIQUEFACTION RESISTANCE AND MINIMIZING UNDESIRABLE HIGHER SURFACE ACCELERATIONS NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN DESIGNING THE SOIL IMPROVEMENT LEVEL.

SUCH WEAKENING IS COMMON WHEN TENSILE MICROCRACKS DEVELOP, CONSTITUTING SITES OF ENHANCED MINERAL DISSOLUTION. A PREVIOUS CONCEPT IS ADOPTED OF REACTIVE CHEMO PLASTICITY, WITH THE YIELD LIMIT DEPENDING ON THE MINERAL MASS DISSOLVED, CAUSING CHEMICAL SOFTENING. THE DISSOLUTION IS DESCRIBED BY A RATE EQUATION AND IS A FUNCTION OF VARIABLE INTERNAL SPECIFIC SURFACE AREA, WHICH IN TURN IS ASSUMED TO BE A FUNCTION OF DILATIVE PLASTIC DEFORMATION. THE CRACK VICINITY IN PLANE STRAIN IS SUBJECT TO A CONSTANT SUBCRITICAL ALL ROUND UNIFORM RADIAL TENSILE TRACTION. THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE MATERIAL IS RIGID PLASTIC WITH CHEMICAL SOFTENING. THE EXTENDED JOHNSON APPROXIMATION IS ADOPTED, MEANING THAT ALL FIELDS INVOLVED ARE AXISYMMETRIC AROUND THE CRACK TIP, WITH A SMALL, UNSTRESSED CAVITY AROUND IT. INITIAL DISSOLUTION PROPORTIONAL TO THE INITIAL POROSITY ACTIVATES THE PLASTIC YIELDING. THE TOTAL DISSOLVED MASS DIFFUSES OUT FROM THE PROCESS ZONE AND THE EXITING MINERAL MASS FLUX CAN BE CORRELATED WITH THE DISPLACEMENT OF THE CRACK TIP. A SIMPLIFIED SEMI ANALYTICAL SOLUTION FOR THIS MODEL IS PRESENTED.

DEEP, UNMINEABLE COALBEDS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE A POSSIBLE CARBON DIOXIDE REPOSITORY BECAUSE COAL IS ABLE TO ADSORB A LARGE AMOUNT OF CARBON DIOXIDE INSIDE ITS MICROPOROUS STRUCTURE. HOWEVER, THE RESPONSE OF COALBEDS IS COMPLEX BECAUSE OF COUPLING BETWEEN THE FLOW AND MECHANICAL RESPONSES. INJECTION OF CARBON DIOXIDE CAUSES COAL TO SWELL, WHICH LEADS TO REDUCTIONS IN PERMEABILITY AND HENCE MAKES INJECTION MORE DIFFICULT, AND AT THE SAME TIME LEADS TO CHANGES IN THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES THAT CAN AFFECT THE STRESS STATE IN THE COAL AND OVERLYING STRATA. APART FROM THE INFLUENCE OF SWELLING ON PERMEABILITY, THE CHEMO MECHANICAL ASPECTS OF CARBON DIOXIDE SEQUESTRATION IN COALBEDS HAVE BEEN LITTLE STUDIED. IN THIS PAPER, THE RESULTS OF A SERIES OF TRIAXIAL TESTS ON A BITUMINOUS COAL ARE PRESENTED THAT SHOW A REDUCTION IN ELASTIC MODULUS AS A RESULT OF CARBON DIOXIDE ADSORPTION. USING THESE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS, A LINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE REDUCTION IN ELASTIC MODULUS AND THE AMOUNT OF ADSORBED GAS WAS FOUND. THIS RELATIONSHIP, IN CONJUNCTION WITH A DUAL POROSITY MODEL, HAS BEEN EMPLOYED TO SIMULATE THE HYDROMECHANICAL RESPONSE OF A COAL BED TO CARBON DIOXIDE INJECTION. THE RESULTS OF THE NUMERICAL SIMULATION SHOW THAT THE SOFTENING OF THE COAL CAN CHANGE THE PERMEABILITY AND STRESSES IN THE COAL, AND SUGGEST THAT CONSIDERING THE SOFTENING EFFECT IS CRUCIAL FOR ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE AND SAFETY OF CARBON DIOXIDE STORAGE IN COALBEDS.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

THIS IS A NEW PARADIGM FOR MANY IN GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING. REALISING THE POTENTIAL OF THIS PARADIGM REQUIRES A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH THAT EMBRACES BIOLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY TO DEVELOP TECHNIQUES FOR BENEFICIAL GROUND MODIFICATION. THIS PAPER ASSESSES THE PROGRESS, OPPORTUNITIES, AND CHALLENGES IN THIS EMERGING FIELD. BIOMEDIATED GEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES, WHICH CONSIST OF A GEOCHEMICAL REACTION REGULATED BY SUBSURFACE MICROBIOLOGY, CURRENTLY BEING EXPLORED INCLUDE MINERAL PRECIPITATION, GAS GENERATION, BIOFILM FORMATION AND BIOPOLYMER GENERATION. FOR EACH OF THESE PROCESSES, SUBSURFACE MICROBIAL PROCESSES ARE EMPLOYED TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO THE DESIRED GEOCHEMICAL REACTIONS AMONG THE MINERALS, ORGANIC MATTER, PORE FLUIDS, AND GASES THAT CONSTITUTE SOIL. GEOTECHNICAL APPLICATIONS CURRENTLY BEING EXPLORED INCLUDE CEMENTATION OF SANDS TO ENHANCE BEARING CAPACITY AND LIQUEFACTION RESISTANCE, SEQUESTRATION OF CARBON, SOIL EROSION CONTROL, GROUNDWATER FLOW CONTROL, AND REMEDIATION OF SOIL AND GROUNDWATER IMPACTED BY METALS AND RADIO NUCLIDES. CHALLENGES IN BIOMEDIATED GROUND MODIFICATION INCLUDE UPSCALING PROCESSES FROM THE LABORATORY TO THE FIELD, IN SITU MONITORING OF REACTIONS, REACTION PRODUCTS AND PROPERTIES, DEVELOPING INTEGRATED BIOGEOCHEMICAL AND GEOTECHNICAL MODELS, MANAGEMENT OF TREATMENT BY PRODUCTS, ESTABLISHING THE DURABILITY AND LONGEVITY/REVERSIBILITY OF THE PROCESS, AND EDUCATION OF ENGINEERS AND RESEARCHERS.

ONE WAY TO REDUCE THE DEGREE OF SATURATION OF SAND IS TO INJECT GAS INTO SAND. THIS APPROACH OFFERS A COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION FOR MITIGATING LIQUEFACTION HAZARD OVER A LARGE AREA. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT EASY TO INJECT GAS INTO SAND IN A UNIFORM MANNER. A BIOGAS METHOD WAS DEVELOPED IN THIS STUDY TO OVERCOME THIS DIFFICULTY. IN THIS METHOD, DENITRIFYING BACTERIA ARE USED TO GENERATE TINY, INERT NITROGEN GAS BUBBLES IN SAND. SHAKING TABLE TESTS USING A FULLY INSTRUMENTED LAMINAR BOX ARE CONDUCTED ON BOTH SATURATED SAND AND SAND CONTAINING MICROBIALLY GENERATED NITROGEN GAS BUBBLES. COMPARISONS OF THE RESULTS OF THESE TESTS INDICATE THAT THE PORE WATER PRESSURE GENERATED IN THE PARTIALLY SATURATED SAND WAS MUCH SMALLER THAN THAT IN SATURATED SAND. THUS THE PROPOSED METHOD IS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE LIQUEFACTION POTENTIAL OF SAND.

IN THE FIRST PART, SELECTED PORE SIZE DISTRIBUTION CURVES ARE INTRODUCED, TO HIGHLIGHT THE INFLUENCE OF SOLUTE CONCENTRATION ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE MICROSTRUCTURE OF COMPACTED SAMPLES. AN AGGREGATED STRUCTURE WITH DUAL PORE NETWORK IS INDUCED BY COMPACTION EVEN AT RELATIVELY HIGH WATER CONTENTS. THIS STRUCTURAL ARRANGEMENT IS ENHANCED BY SALINISATION, AND HAS A NOTABLE INFLUENCE ON TRANSIENT VOLUME CHANGE BEHAVIOUR THAT IS, THE OCCURRENCE OF DIFFERENT STAGES OF SWELLING UPON PORE WATER DILUTION AND HIGHER VOLUME CHANGE RATES UPON SALINISATION. A COUPLED CHEMO HYDRO MECHANICAL MODEL, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION DOUBLE STRUCTURAL FEATURES FROM A CHEMO MECHANICAL VIEWPOINT, IS DESCRIBED AND THEN USED TO INTERPRET THESE BEHAVIOURAL RESPONSES AND PRESENT COMPLEMENTARY INFORMATION ON LOCAL TRANSIENT PROCESSES. THE MODEL IS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY AN INTRA AGGREGATE AND AN INTER AGGREGATE DOMAIN, AND ASSIGNS DIFFERENT VALUES OF HYDRAULIC PRESSURE AND OSMOTIC SUCTION TO EACH DOMAIN. DISTINCT CONSTITUTIVE LAWS FOR BOTH DOMAINS ARE FORMULATED, AND THE FLOW OF SALT AND WATER BETWEEN THE TWO DOMAINS IS ACCOUNTED FOR BY A PHYSICALLY BASED MASS EXCHANGE TERM. THE MODEL IS USED TO SIMULATE SALT DIFFUSION TESTS RUN IN AN OEDOMETER AT CONSTANT VERTICAL STRESS. PARAMETERS USED IN THE FORMULATION ARE CALIBRATED BASED ON SEPARATE EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE, BOTH THROUGH DIRECT TEST RESULTS AND THROUGH BACK ANALYSES OF LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

THESE FACTORS PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF VERY ACTIVE CLAYS, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO VOLUMETRIC BEHAVIOUR. THE MODEL IS BASED ON AN EXISTING DOUBLE STRUCTURE FORMULATION THAT DISTINGUISHES SPECIFICALLY BETWEEN MICRO STRUCTURE AND MACROSTRUCTURE. CHEMICAL EFFECTS ARE DEFINED AT THE MICRO STRUCTURAL LEVEL, THE SEAT OF THE BASIC PHYSICO CHEMICAL PHENOMENA AFFECTING HIGHLY SWELLING CLAYS. THE MICRO STRUCTURAL MODEL ACCOUNTS FOR CHANGES IN BOTH OSMOTIC SUCTION AND IN CATION CONTENT. MICROSTRUCTURAL STRAINS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE REVERSIBLE; MATERIAL IRREVERSIBILITY ARISES FROM THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE TWO STRUCTURAL LEVELS. THE FORMULATION IS DEVELOPED FOR GENERAL UNSATURATED CONDITIONS; SATURATION IS CONSIDERED AS A LIMITING CASE. THE MODEL IS SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED TO THE REPRODUCTION OF EXPERIMENTAL BEHAVIOUR OBSERVED IN OEDOMETER TESTS ON SATURATED BENTONITE SUBJECTED TO CHEMO MECHANICAL LOADINGS, AND IN HYDRATION TESTS OF UNSATURATED BENTONITE PERFORMED USING DIFFERENT SOLUTE CONCENTRATIONS.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT REPRESENTS AN IDEALISED REPRESENTATION OF TWO SAND GRAINS. THE GRAIN SURFACES AND ASPERITIES WERE EXAMINED IN THE SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE AND ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPE (AFM) FOR FRACTURES, SILICA GEL GROWTH AND POLYMER STRENGTH. IN 500 PPM SOLUTION, SILICA GEL STRUCTURES A FEW HUNDRED MICROMETRES LONG APPEARED BETWEEN STRESSED SILICA CUBES. IN 200 PPM SOLUTION, SILICA DEPOSITS WERE FOUND AROUND DAMAGED GRAIN SURFACES, WHILE AT 90 PPM (BELOW SILICA SOLUBILITY IN NEUTRAL PH), FIBRES A FEW MICROMETRES IN LENGTH WERE FOUND GROWING IN CUBE CRACKS. AFM PULLING TESTS FOUND POLYMERS WITH STRENGTH OF THE ORDER OF 100 NN. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT PROLONGED COMPRESSION PRODUCED DAMAGE IN GRAINS, RAISING LOCAL SILICON ION CONCENTRATION AND ACCELERATING PRECIPITATION, POLYMERISATION AND GELATION OF SILICA ON GRAIN SURFACES, ENHANCING SOIL STRENGTH AT THE MICRO SCALE, AND HENCE MOST LIKELY CONTRIBUTING TO THE AGEING PHENOMENON OBSERVED AT THE MACRO SCALE.

DATA ON PHASE VOLUME AND GRADING CHANGES HAVE BEEN OBTAINED FROM OEDOMETRIC DISSOLUTION TESTS ON SAND SALT MIXTURES. PHASE VOLUME CHANGES ARE DEFINED BY A (DISSOLUTION INDUCED) VOID VOLUME CHANGE PARAMETER (LAMBDA). GRADING CHANGES ARE INTERPRETED USING GRADING ENTROPY COORDINATES, WHICH ALLOW A GRADING CURVE TO BE DEPICTED AS A SINGLE DATA POINT AND CHANGES IN GRADING AS A VECTOR QUANTITY RATHER THAN A FAMILY OF DISTRIBUTION CURVES. BY COMBINING LAMBDA CONTOURS WITH PRE TO POST DISSOLUTION GRADING ENTROPY COORDINATE PATHS, AN INNOVATIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE VOLUMETRIC CONSEQUENCES OF PARTICLE LOSS IS OBTAINED. PATHS ASSOCIATED WITH SMALL SOLUBLE PARTICLES, THE LOSS OF WHICH TRIGGERS RELATIVELY LITTLE SETTLEMENT BUT LARGE INCREASE IN VOID RATIO, TRACK PARALLEL TO THE LAMBDA CONTOURS. PATHS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOSS OF LARGER PARTICLES, WHICH CAN DESTABILISE THE SAND SKELETON, TEND TO TRACK ACROSS THE A CONTOURS.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

SUCH CHEMICALS INCLUDE THOSE FROM CONTAMINATED LAND WHICH CAN COMPLICATE THE DESIGN OF UNDERGROUND WORKS AND MAY ADD SIGNIFICANTLY TO COSTS. HOWEVER, INVESTIGATION TECHNIQUES AND REMEDIAL PROCEDURES ARE NOW WELL ESTABLISHED FOR MANY CONTAMINATED LAND CHEMICALS, AND THEIR EFFECTS SHOULD NO LONGER COME AS A SURPRISE TO THE CONSTRUCTION TEAM. IN CONTRAST, CHEMICALS NATURALLY PRESENT IN THE GROUND OR DELIBERATELY INTRODUCED INTO IT CAN LEAD TO UNEXPECTED PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY IF THEIR EFFECT IS GREATLY OUT OF PROPORTION TO THEIR CONCENTRATION IN THE GROUND.

HOWEVER, DESPITE THE VAST NUMBER OF SITUATIONS IN WHICH COUPLINGS BETWEEN CHEMISTRY AND MECHANICS OCCUR, THE AVAILABLE CONSTITUTIVE MODELS RELY ON LIMITED EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE. THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF AN EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAMME ON THE CHEMO MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF A NON SWELLING ILLITE. THE OSMOTIC SUCTION IS CONTROLLED THROUGH THE ION CONCENTRATION OF SODIUM CHLORIDE IN THE PORE WATER. STRESS PATHS INCLUDE MECHANICAL LOADING AT A CONSTANT OSMOTIC SUCTION, AND AN INCREASING OSMOTIC SUCTION AT A CONSTANT MECHANICAL STRESS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS POINT OUT A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE OSMOTIC SUCTION AND INITIAL OEDOMETRIC MODULUS, AS WELL AS BETWEEN THE OSMOTIC SUCTION AND YIELD STRESS. A CONSTITUTIVE FRAMEWORK FOR SOILS IS EXTENDED TO TAKE THE OBSERVED CHEMO MECHANICAL COUPLINGS INTO ACCOUNT. THE NUMERICAL MODEL HAS BEEN CALIBRATED FOR THE ILLITE USING THE PARAMETERS OBTAINED THROUGH THE TESTS UNDER MECHANICAL LOADING AT A CONSTANT CONCENTRATION, AND VALIDATED USING MORE ELABORATE STRESS PATHS. THE PRESENTED EXPERIMENTAL AND CONSTITUTIVE INVESTIGATION BUILDS A BASIS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF ENGINEERING ISSUES IN WHICH PORE LIQUID CHEMISTRY PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

THEIR COMMON USE AS HYDRAULIC AND CONTAMINANT BARRIERS FOR LANDFILL AND SOIL REMEDIATION APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THE FINAL DISPOSAL OF NUCLEAR WASTE, NEEDS TO BE SUPPORTED BY ADEQUATE THEORETICAL MODELLING OF THEIR MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR AND TRANSPORT PROPERTIES, IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE EXPECTED PERFORMANCE IN THE LONG TERM. TO THIS END, A THEORETICAL APPROACH HAS BEEN PROPOSED IN ORDER TO DERIVE CONSTITUTIVE EQUATIONS FOR THEIR COUPLED CHEMICAL HYDRAULIC MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR. THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL PARAMETERS THAT GOVERN THE TRANSPORT OF ELECTROLYTE SOLUTIONS THROUGH BENTONITES THAT IS, THE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY, THE REFLECTION COEFFICIENT (WHICH IS ALSO CALLED THE CHEMICO OSMOTIC EFFICIENCY COEFFICIENT), AND THE OSMOTIC EFFECTIVE DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT HAVE BEEN MEASURED THROUGH LABORATORY TESTS ON A BENTONITE WITH POROSITY OF 0.81, OVER A RANGE OF SODIUM CHLORIDE CONCENTRATIONS IN THE PORE SOLUTION THAT VARIED FROM 5 MM TO 100 MM. THE RELEVANCE OF THE OSMOTIC PHENOMENA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO DECREASE WHEN THE SALT CONCENTRATION INCREASES. THE OBTAINED RESULTS HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED BY ASSUMING THAT THE MICROSCOPIC DEVIATIONS OF THE PORE SOLUTION STATE VARIABLES FROM THEIR AVERAGE VALUES ARE NEGLIGIBLE. IN THIS WAY, IT IS POSSIBLE TO INTERPRET THE MACROSCOPIC BEHAVIOUR ON THE BASIS OF THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE BENTONITE MINERALOGICAL COMPONENTS.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

IN CLAYEY SOILS, CLOGGING OF THE WORKING TOOLS IS AMONG THE MAIN HAZARDS. ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE THIS RISK BY ADDING ANTI CLOGGING CHEMICALS DO NOT ALWAYS PRODUCE THE DESIRED EFFECT. IN THIS PAPER, THE LIMITED EFFICIENCY OF THE EXISTING CONDITIONING CHEMICALS IS QUANTIFIED AND EXPLAINED, AND AN ENHANCED INTERACTION MECHANISM IS PROPOSED. THIS MECHANISM IS BASED ON SEALING THE CLAY AGGREGATES AGAINST THE PENETRATION OF WATER; IT REQUIRES THE ADDITION OF POLYAMINE CHEMICALS, AS A NEWLY PATENTED APPLICATION. THESE CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE CLOGGING POTENTIAL OF DIFFERENT CLAY PASTES OVER A BROAD RANGE OF WATER CONTENTS, USING NOVEL APPROACHES FOR QUANTIFYING THE CLOGGING BEHAVIOUR OF CLAYS IN GENERAL. THESE METHODS ALSO ESTABLISH IMPORTANT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN EMPIRICAL STICKINESS AND MORE FUNDAMENTAL SOIL PARAMETERS, AND IN PARTICULAR THE RATIO BETWEEN ADHESION AND STRENGTH. TOGETHER WITH MICROSCOPIC INVESTIGATIONS AND ADSORPTION MEASUREMENTS, THIS PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO THE WORKING MECHANISM OF THE NEW CHEMICALS AT THE PARTICLE LEVEL; IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS MECHANISM AND THAT OF COMMERCIALLY USED FOAMS AND POLYMERS.

IN THIS STUDY, UNCONFINED COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH TESTS WERE CONDUCTED ON SAND SAMPLES TREATED USING 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 AND 1 M UREA CALCIUM CHLORIDE SOLUTIONS. IT WAS FOUND THAT, ALTHOUGH THE STRENGTH OF TESTED SAMPLES ALL INCREASED AFTER MICP TREATMENT, THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS INCREASE DEPENDED ON THE CONCENTRATION USED IN THE TREATMENT AND THAT THE USE OF A LOW CHEMICAL CONCENTRATION (I.E. UREA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE) SOLUTION RESULTED IN STRONGER SAMPLES. PERMEABILITY TEST RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE USE OF A HIGH UREA CALCIUM CHLORIDE CONCENTRATION SOLUTION RESULTED IN A RAPID DROP IN PERMEABILITY AT THE EARLY STAGE OF CALCITE PRECIPITATION, WHEREAS THE USE OF A LOW CHEMICAL CONCENTRATION SOLUTION WAS FOUND TO RESULT IN A MORE GRADUAL AND UNIFORM DECREASE IN PERMEABILITY. THIS OBSERVED EFFECT OF CHEMICAL CONCENTRATION ON THE STRENGTH AND PERMEABILITY OF MICP CEMENTED SOILS CAN HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DESIGN OF MICP FOR FIELD APPLICATIONS.

Y., RESEARCH INSTITUTE IN CIVIL AND MECHANICAL ENGINEERING, UMR CNRS 6183, ECOLE CENTRALE NANTES, FRANCE	PRESENTED HERE IS A NUMERICAL METHOD ABLE TO PREDICT THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF GRANULAR MATERIALS SUBJECTED TO PARTICLE REMOVAL. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF SOILS SUBJECTED TO INTERNAL EROSION IN HYDRAULIC WORKS. THE APPROACH IS BASED ON A HOMOGENISATION TECHNIQUE FOR DERIVING THE STRESS STRAIN RELATIONSHIP OF A GRANULAR ASSEMBLY FROM FORCES AND DISPLACEMENTS AT THE PARTICLE LEVEL. THE SOILS LOCAL BEHAVIOUR IS ASSUMED TO FOLLOW A HERTZ MINDLIN ELASTIC LAW AND A MOHR COULOMB PLASTIC LAW. SLIDING RESISTANCE ON EACH PLANE IS MADE TO DEPEND ON THE ACTUAL VOID RATIO OF THE GRANULAR ASSEMBLY. THE SOLID FRACTION REMOVAL IS MODELLED BY PROGRESSIVELY INCREASING THE GRANULAR ASSEMBLY VOID RATIO, WHICH PROVOKES A DECREASE OF THE SLIDING RESISTANCE OF EACH INTERPARTICLE CONTACT, LEADING TO MACROSCOPIC DEFORMATIONS OF THE SOIL SPECIMEN. AT ELEVATED STRESS LEVELS, LARGE DEFORMATIONS CAN DEVELOP AND LEAD TO SOIL FAILURE. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT A TYPE OF FAILURE CALLED DIFFUSE FAILURE CAN OCCUR IN ERODED SOIL MASSES WHENEVER AN INCREASE IN PORE PRESSURE IS GENERATED WITHIN THE SOIL. THESE NUMERICAL RESULTS APPEAR TO BE COHERENT WITH OBSERVATIONS MADE ON EMBANKMENT DAMS THAT HAVE SUFFERED INTERNAL EROSION AND IN PARTICULAR, WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF THEIR MODES OF FAILURE.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

PREVIOUS STABILITY ANALYSES OF SLOPES WITH CRACKS ARE BASED MAINLY ON LIMIT EQUILIBRIUM METHODS, WHICH ARE NOT RIGOROUS, AND ARE LIMITED IN THEIR CAPACITY FOR ANALYSIS, SINCE THEY USUALLY REQUIRE THE USER TO ASSUME A CRACK DEPTH AND LOCATION IN THE SLOPE. CONVERSELY, NUMERICAL METHODS (E.G. FINITE ELEMENT METHOD) STRUGGLE TO DEAL WITH THE PRESENCE OF CRACKS IN THE SLOPE, BECAUSE OF THE DISCONTINUITIES INTRODUCED IN BOTH THE STATIC AND KINEMATIC FIELDS BY THE PRESENCE OF CRACKS. IN THIS PAPER, SOLUTIONS ARE PROVIDED IN A GENERAL FORM CONSIDERING CASES OF BOTH DRY AND WATER FILLED CRACKS. CRITICAL FAILURE MECHANISMS ARE DETERMINED FOR CRACKS OF KNOWN DEPTH BUT UNSPECIFIED LOCATION, CRACKS OF KNOWN LOCATION BUT UNKNOWN DEPTH, AND CRACKS OF UNSPECIFIED LOCATION AND DEPTH. THE UPPER BOUNDS ARE ACHIEVED BY ASSUMING A RIGID ROTATIONAL MECHANISM (LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL FAILURE LINE). IT IS ALSO SHOWN THAT THE VALUES OBTAINED PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT ON THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE UPPER BOUNDS BASED ON PLANAR FAILURE MECHANISMS, PROVIDING A REDUCTION IN THE STABILITY FACTOR OF UP TO 85%. CHARTS OF SOLUTIONS ARE PRESENTED IN DIMENSIONLESS FORM FOR EASE OF USE BY PRACTITIONERS.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

HOWEVER, IT CAN BE DIFFICULT AND TIME CONSUMING TO CAPTURE IN DESIGN, ESPECIALLY IN A WAY THAT GIVES A PHYSICAL INSIGHT INTO THE KEY BEHAVIORAL MECHANISMS INVOLVED. A CALCULATION PROCEDURE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED FOR RETAINING WALLS PROPPED NEAR THE CREST THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT BOTH THE NON LINEARITY OF THE STRESS STRAIN BEHAVIOR OF THE SOIL AND THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE WALL. RESULTS FOR DIFFERENT PORE WATER PRESSURE CONDITIONS, SOIL STRENGTHS AND SOIL AND WALL STIFF NESSES ARE PRESENTED IN THE FORM OF LOOK UP CHARTS, AND ARE COMPARED WITH THOSE DERIVED FROM FACTORED LIMIT EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSES. A DIMENSIONLESS PARAMETER IS INTRODUCED TO REPRESENT THE RELATIVE SOIL WALL STIFFNESS, AND ITS IMPORTANCE IS DEMONSTRATED. A CRITICAL FLEXIBILITY RATIO IS IDENTIFIED AT WHICH THE BENDING MOMENTS START TO REDUCE BELOW THOSE GIVEN BY A CONVENTIONAL LIMIT EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATION. THIS RATIO IS LINKED TO THE WALL DEFLECTION, AND IS USED TO DISTINGUISH A STIFF FROM A FLEXIBLE SYSTEM IN SOILS OF DIFFERENT STRENGTHS AND PORE WATER PRESSURE CONDITIONS. THE APPROACH IS DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO PREVIOUS STUDIES.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

SHEAR STIFFNESS OF GRANULAR MATERIAL AT SMALL STRAINS: DOES IT DEPEND ON GRAIN SIZE?	2013	GEOTECHNIQUE	63	2		165	179		1	HTTP://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URL?EID2 S2.0 84878098683&PARTNERID40&MD5D3D802E7F7D28051C374F30D98799785	DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, THE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG, HONG KONG	YANG, J., DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, THE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG, HONG KONG; GU, X.Q., DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, THE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG, HONG KONG	THE SHEAR STIFFNESS OF GRANULAR MATERIAL AT SMALL STRAIN LEVELS IS A SUBJECT OF BOTH THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL INTEREST. THIS PAPER POSES TWO FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS THAT APPEAR TO BE INTERRELATED: (A) WHETHER THIS STIFFNESS PROPERTY IS DEPENDENT ON PARTICLE SIZE; AND (B) WHETHER THE EFFECT OF TESTING METHOD EXISTS IN TERMS OF LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS USING RESONANT COLUMN (RC) AND BENDER ELEMENT (BE) TESTS. FOR THREE UNIFORMLY GRADED TYPES OF GLASS BEADS OF DIFFERENT MEAN SIZES (0195 MM, 0.920 MM AND 1.750 MM), LABORATORY TESTS WERE CONDUCTED AT A RANGE OF CONFINING STRESSES AND VOID RATIOS, USING AN APPARATUS THAT INCORPORATES BOTH RC AND BE FUNCTIONS AND THUS ALLOWS RELIABLE AND INSIGHTFUL COMPARISONS. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE SMALL STRAIN STIFFNESS, DETERMINED BY EITHER THE RC OR BE TESTS, DOES NOT VARY APPRECIABLY WITH PARTICLE SIZE, AND IT MAY BE PRACTICALLY ASSUMED TO BE SIZE INDEPENDENT. THE LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS ALSO INDICATE THAT THE BE MEASUREMENTS OF SMALL STRAIN STIFFNESS ARE COMPARABLE TO THE CORRESPONDING RC MEASUREMENTS, WITH DIFFERENCES OF LESS THAN 10%. FURTHERMORE, THE BE MEASUREMENTS FOR FINE GLASS BEADS ARE FOUND TO BE CONSISTENTLY HIGHER THAN THE RC MEASUREMENTS, ESPECIALLY AT LARGE STRESS LEVELS, WHEREAS THIS FEATURE BECOMES LESS EVIDENT FOR MEDIUM COARSE GLASS BEADS, AND EVENTUALLY DIMINISHES FOR COARSE GLASS BEADS. THE STUDY INDICATES THAT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OUTPUT SIGNALS IN BE TESTS CAN BE LARGELY AFFECTED BY THE FREQUENCY OF THE INPUT SIGNAL, THE MEAN PARTICLE SIZE OF THE MATERIAL AND THE CONFINING STRESS LEVEL, AND THAT THESE FACTORS ARE INTERRELATED. IMPROPER INTERPRETATION OF WAVE SIGNALS MAY LEAD TO SHEAR STIFFNESS MEASUREMENTS THAT ARE UNREASONABLY LOW, EITHER SHOWING A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE WITH PARTICLE SIZE OR SHOWING THE OPPOSITE. A MICROMECHANICS BASED ANALYSIS ASSUMING THE HERTZ MINDLIN CONTACT LAW IS PRESENTED TO OFFER AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SIZE EFFECT FROM THE GRAIN SCALE.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

IT HAS RECEIVED GROWING INTEREST OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, OWING TO THE RECOGNITION OF ITS RICH HERITAGE IN THE FRAMEWORK OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, THE GROWTH OF DRY MASONRY HAS BEEN SLOWED BY THE LACK OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE PROVING ITS RELIABILITY. THE AUTHORS HAVE PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED A MODEL BASED ON YIELD DESIGN TO ASSESS DRYSTONE WALL STABILITY. THIS THEORETICAL APPROACH HAS BEEN SUPPLEMENTED BY FIELD EXPERIMENTS ON FULL SCALE DRYSTONE RETAINING WALLS THAT WERE BACKFILLED UNTIL FAILURE WITH A COHESIONLESS SOIL. THESE FIELD EXPERIMENTS FOLLOWED A FIRST SET OF EXPERIMENTS IN 2002 2003 IN WHICH THE WALLS WERE LOADED USING HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE. THE AIM OF THESE EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAMMES WAS TO ACHIEVE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF DRYSTONE MASONRY BEHAVIOUR UNDER LOADING, AND OF ITS FAILURE MODE. THE PRESENT PAPER CONSISTS OF A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THESE THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS, AND PROVIDES A RICHER UNDERSTANDING OF DRYSTONE RETAINING WALL PHENOMENOLOGY. FURTHER PERSPECTIVES ON THIS WORK ARE PRESENTED IN THE CONCLUSION.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

COMPUTATIONS SUGGESTED THAT A CERTAIN RANGE OF ROOT AREA RATIO (THE EFFECTIVE RAR RANGE, OR ERAR RANGE) SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED FOR A GIVEN SLOPE GEOMETRY, VEGETATION TYPE AND MATURITY PERIOD. THE ERAR RANGE REPRESENTS ALL THE RARS THAT IMPART A FACTOR OF SAFETY (FOS) GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO A PARTICULAR FOS (THE BENCHMARK FOS). THE BENCHMARK BMFOS IS THE ANTICIPATED FOS, DEPENDING ON FACTORS SUCH AS DEMOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION AND PROXIMITY TO UTILITIES. BEYOND THE ERAR RANGE, VEGETATION DOES NOT IMPART STABILITY TO THE SLOPE. THEORETICALLY, HIGHER RANGES OF RAR BEYOND THE ERAR RANGE (THE INEFFECTIVE RAR RANGE) CAN CAUSE SLOPE FAILURE. THIS NEW NUMERICAL SCHEME EVALUATES THE ROOT REINFORCEMENT EFFECT ON SLOPE STABILITY. THIS INFORMATION IS USEFUL FOR ANALYSING, DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING SOIL BIOENGINEERING SLOPES.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

A THREE DIMENSIONAL HYSTERETIC SOIL WATER RETENTION CURVE	2013	GEOTECHNIQUE	63	2		155	164			HTTP://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URL?EID2 S2.0 84878058081&PARTNERID40&MD5544BE8596938359E21D25B9F7F4BE087	DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING, IMPERIAL COLLEGE, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM	TSIAMPOUSI, A., DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING, IMPERIAL COLLEGE, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM; ZDRAVKOVIC, L.; POTTS, D.M.	ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES IN UNSATURATED SOIL MECHANICS IS THE SOIL WATER RETENTION CURVE AND ITS COUPLING TO THE MECHANICAL COMPONENT OF SOIL BEHAVIOUR. IT HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNISED THAT THE RETENTION CURVE EXHIBITS SIGNIFICANT HYSTERESIS, AND THAT IT IS AFFECTED BY THE SPECIFIC VOLUME. SEVERAL ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE PAST TO MODEL THIS BEHAVIOUR. A NOVEL APPROACH IS PROPOSED HEREIN, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR BOTH THE HYDRAULIC HYSTERESIS AND THE SPECIFIC VOLUME DEPENDENCE OF THE RETENTION RELATIONSHIP IN A THREE DIMENSIONAL FORMULATION. THE PRIMARY AND THE SCANNING PATHS ARE SIMPLE GEOMETRIC CURVES, WHICH HAVE A COMMON TANGENT AT THE POINT OF INTERSECTION, ENSURING A SMOOTH TRANSITION FROM SCANNING TO PRIMARY PATHS. A SMALL NUMBER OF PARAMETERS ARE REQUIRED TO DEFINE THE PRIMARY PATHS, AND NO FITTING PARAMETERS ARE NECESSARY FOR GENERATION OF THE SCANNING PATHS. AS KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPECIFIC VOLUME AND ITS VARIATION IS REQUIRED, THE RETENTION MODEL NEEDS TO BE EMPLOYED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A CONSTITUTIVE MODEL CAPABLE OF REPRODUCING THE COMPLEX BEHAVIOUR OF UNSATURATED SOILS. TO GUARANTEE CONSISTENCY WITH THE RETENTION MODEL, THE DEGREE OF SATURATION NEEDS TO BE INCORPORATED IN THE SPECIFIC VOLUME SUCTION RELATIONSHIP ADOPTED WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIVE MODEL. TO ACCOMMODATE SUCH A FEATURE WHEN ABSENT, A NEW EXPRESSION FOR THE SOIL COMPRESSIBILITY WITH SUCTION AS A FUNCTION OF THE DEGREE OF SATURATION IS PROPOSED. SIMULATIONS OF LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS ON UNSATURATED SOILS, INVOLVING CYCLIC CHANGES OF APPLIED SUCTION, DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED MODELLING APPROACH.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

THE SUPPORTING SOIL CAN BE MODELLED AS AN ELASTIC MEDIUM, WHICH CAN BE CALIBRATED TO REPRESENT THE STIFFNESS OF THE SOILS ADJACENT TO THE BEAM (OR PILE). THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO STUDY THE INFLUENCE OF SPATIALLY RANDOM SOIL STIFFNESS ON DEFORMATIONS OF TRANSVERSELY LOADED HOMOGENEOUS PILES AND BEAMS, USING A COMBINATION OF FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS, RANDOM FIELD THEORY AND MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS. FOLLOWING CODE VALIDATION AGAINST ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS, THE METHOD INVESTIGATES HOW THE STATISTICALLY DEFINED SOIL STIFFNESS (MEAN, STANDARD DEVIATION AND SPATIAL CORRELATION LENGTH) INFLUENCES THE MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION OF PILE OR BEAM DEFLECTION. THE GOAL OF SUCH AN APPROACH IS TO ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITY OF DEFLECTIONS EXCEEDING SOME DESIGN THRESHOLD.  2013 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

THE PARTICLES USED IN THIS STUDY WERE SPHERICAL, AND THEIR SIZE RANGE MIMICKED VARIOUS POWER LAW DISTRIBUTIONS. THE CONTACT FORMULATION WAS CALIBRATED SUCH THAT THE DIFFERENT COMPRESSIBILITY AND INITIAL SPECIFIC VOLUME OF NON UNIFORM ASSEMBLIES DEPENDED PURELY ON THE INTERACTION OF DIFFERENT PARTICLE SIZES OF THE NON UNIFORM GRADATIONS. THE COMPRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR OF THESE ASSEMBLIES CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER BIG PARTICLE DOMINATED OR SMALL PARTICLE DOMINATED. THE UNDERLYING MICROMECHANICAL EXPLANATIONS FOR THE EFFECT OF THE PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION ON THE PACKING CHARACTERISTICS AND ON THE COMPRESSIBILITY ARE PRESENTED. PARTICLES INVOLVED IN THE STRONG FORCE TRANSMISSION, WHICH CARRIED LARGER THAN AVERAGE CONTACT FORCES, WERE FOUND TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE STIFFNESS OF GRANULAR SAMPLES. WHEN LOOSE AND DENSE SAMPLES WITH THE SAME GRADING WERE COMPRESSED TO A STAGE WHERE THEIR STIFFNESSES WERE IDENTICAL, AN IDENTICAL SIZE DISTRIBUTION WAS FOUND FOR THOSE PARTICLES INVOLVED IN THE STRONG FORCE NETWORK. FOR SOME MATERIALS, THERE EXISTED REGIONS OF PARTICLES THAT DID NOT CARRY ANY STRONG FORCE, AND THE NON AFFINE MOVEMENTS OF THESE SMALL PARTICLES PARTIALLY FILLING THE VOID SPACE BETWEEN THE BIGGER PARTICLES WERE ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT. THIS BEHAVIOUR WAS VISUALISED IN THE DEM SIMULATIONS. AS THESE PARTICLES REARRANGED THEMSELVES, THESE REGIONS CONTRIBUTED TO A HIGHER VOLUMETRIC COMPRESSION. IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT THE COORDINATION NUMBER OF DEM PARTICLES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED WITH BETTER GRADATIONS. A CHANGE IN THE PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION OF REAL SAND THROUGH PARTICLE BREAKAGE WOULD THEREFORE LEAD TO A HIGHER COORDINATION NUMBER OF PARTICLES, AND IT WOULD GRADUALLY REDUCE THE PROBABILITY OF PARTICLE BREAKAGE DURING THE LATER STAGES OF THE COMPRESSION, AS HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN OTHER LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS.

LIKE MANY OFFSHORE STRUCTURES, SCRS ARE SUBJECTED TO GROSS CYCLIC MOVEMENTS DURING OPERATION, WHICH REMOULD THE SEABED SOIL. THE FATIGUE LIFE OF THESE STRUCTURES IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO THE STIFFNESS AND STRENGTH OF THE SEABED RESPONSE. ACCURATE MODELLING OF THIS BEHAVIOUR REQUIRES A FRAMEWORK THAT CAN CAPTURE THE CHANGES IN SOIL STRENGTH AND STIFFNESS THAT OCCUR THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN LIFE, ACCOUNTING FOR REMOULDING DURING EXTREME EVENTS, AND RECONSOLIDATION DURING THE INTERVENING PERIODS. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES SUCH A FRAMEWORK, WHICH IS COUCHED IN EFFECTIVE STRESS TERMS. SOIL SOFTENING DURING REMOULDING IS PREDOMINANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH EXCESS PORE PRESSURE GENERATION, AND THE SUBSEQUENT REGAIN IN STRENGTH IS LINKED TO THE DISSIPATION OF EXCESS PORE PRESSURE. THE FRAMEWORK CAN DESCRIBE THE VARIATION OF RESISTANCE ON A CYLINDER (I.E. A PIPE) DURING ANY SEQUENCE OF VERTICAL CYCLIC MOTION, INTERSPERSED WITH PAUSE PERIODS. THE FRAMEWORK IS BASED ON A CRITICAL STATE APPROACH, WITH THE CURRENT STRENGTH BEING LINKED TO THE CURRENT MOISTURE CONTENT. THE FRAMEWORK IS SHOWN TO CAPTURE WELL THE LOAD PENETRATION RESPONSE DURING AN EPISODIC T BAR PENETROMETER TEST. THE OPERATIVE SOIL STRENGTH IS SHOWN TO VARY DRAMATICALLY THROUGHOUT THIS EVENT, WITH THE SOFTENING EFFECT OF REMOULDING BEING ALMOST ENTIRELY NEGATED BY A REGAIN IN STRENGTH ASSOCIATED WITH PERIODS OF PARTIAL OR COMPLETE RECONSOLIDATION. THE FRAMEWORK PROVIDES A BASIS FOR CAPTURING THESE DRAMATIC EFFECTS TO AID PIPELINE AND RISER DESIGN (AND OTHER PROCESSES THAT INVOLVE GROSS REMOULDING AND RECONSOLIDATION), WITHOUT RECOURSE TO A FULL NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF THE ENTIRE SOIL DOMAIN.

AS WELL AS SHOWING CONSIDERABLE RADIAL VARIATION, THE STRESSES DEVELOPED AT ANY GIVEN DEPTH BUILD SHARPLY AS THE TIP APPROACHES, AND REDUCE RAPIDLY AS IT PASSES. CLEAR DIFFERENCES ARE EVIDENT BETWEEN THE BEHAVIOURS SEEN CLOSE TO THE SHAFT DURING ALTERNATE PENETRATION AND PAUSE PERIODS. LOAD CYCLING EFFECTS ARE MOST SIGNIFICANT CLOSE TO THE SHAFT, WHERE THE LOCAL STRESS PATHS INDICATE A TENDENCY FOR CONSTRAINED DILATANT BEHAVIOUR, WITH RADIAL STRESSES INCREASING, DURING LOADING.

THE DESICCATION TESTS WERE CONDUCTED ON THREE MATERIALS CLAY, POTATO STARCH AND MILLED QUARTZ SAND ALL THREE FEATURING SIMILAR FRACTURE ENERGY. TWO CONTROLLING FACTORS WERE IDENTIFIED IN DESICCATION CRACKING, REGARDLESS OF THE MATERIAL. THE FIRST IS THE TENSILE STRESS AND STRAIN ENERGY DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE MATERIAL WHEN THE MATERIAL IS RESTRAINED AGAINST SHRINKAGE. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE TENSILE STRESS WILL DEPEND ON THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AND MATERIAL STIFFNESS, AND WILL DICTATE WHERE CRACKS ARE LIKELY TO ORIGINATE. THE SECOND FACTOR IS THAT THE EXACT POSITIONS OF CRACK INITIATIONS WILL BE CONTROLLED BY THE FLAWS AND/OR PORES WITHIN THE MATERIAL. FOR MATERIALS SUCH AS CLAY, WITH VERY FINE PARTICLES, THE CRACKING MECHANISM IS GOVERNED BY FLAWS, SINCE THE DESATURATION OF FINE PORES WOULD REQUIRE VERY HIGH SUCTION STRESS, AND THIS REQUIREMENT LEADS TO SEQUENTIAL CRACKING AND ORTHOGONAL CRACK PATTERNS. IF THE MATERIAL HAS PARTICLES GIVING RELATIVELY LARGE AND UNIFORM PORE SIZES WITH HIGH MOISTURE DIFFUSIVITY LEADING TO HIGH SHRINKAGE ENERGY PRIOR TO CRACKING, THEN THE FRACTURE ENERGY BALANCE INDICATES THAT CRACKING CAN OCCUR IN NEAR HEXAGONAL PATTERNS WITH 120 CRACK INITIATIONS, WHICH OCCUR PREDOMINANTLY SIMULTANEOUSLY. HOWEVER, EVEN FOR MATERIALS WITH LOWER MOISTURE DIFFUSIVITY, SUCH AS FOR CLAY, HIGH DESICCATION RATES CAN GIVE RISE TO AN EFFECTIVE LAYER OVER WHICH HIGH SUCTIONS AND STRAIN ENERGY DEVELOP, LEADING TO ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS DENSE CRACKING.

Y., INSTITUT DE RECHERCHE EN GENIE CIVIL ET MECANIQUE, ECOLE CENTRALE DE NANTES, FRANCE	THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO CHARACTERISE ALONG VARIOUS STRESS PATHS THE MICROSTRUCTURAL EVOLUTION OF A DEEP WATER MARINE SEDIMENT FROM THE GULF OF GUINEA (GOG). RESULTS OBTAINED AT THE MACROSCOPIC LEVEL HAVE SHOWN THAT THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL BEHAVIOUR OF THE GOG SEDIMENT IS EXPLAINED BY THE PROPERTIES OF REMOULDED SAMPLES GIVEN BY THE ISOTROPIC AND CRITICAL STATE LINES, AND BY THE PROPERTIES OF THE INTACT SAMPLES GIVEN BY THE DAMAGE EVOLUTION OF THE INTER AGGREGATE BONDS. MICROSTRUCTURAL INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED BY MERCURY INTRUSION POROSIMETRY AND SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY DEMON STRATE THAT THE VOLUMETRIC STRAINS MEASURED AT THE MACROSCOPIC LEVEL COME FROM INTER AGGREGATE PORE VARIATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEGRADING OF THE INTER AGGREGATE BONDS. THE MECHANISM RESPONSIBLE FOR REORIENTING THE PARTICLES APPEARS TO APPLY IN THE CASE OF THE REMOULDED SEDIMENT. AS FOR THE NATURAL SEDIMENT, IT IS FIRST NECESSARY TO INCREASE THE ISOTROPIC CONSOLIDATION STRESS TOWARDS HIGHER VALUES IN ORDER TO BREAK THE BONDS BETWEEN THE AGGREGATES BEFORE IT BECOMES POSSIBLE TO ACTIVATE THE PARTICLE REORIENTATION MECHANISM AND THUS APPROACH THE REMOULDED BEHAVIOUR.

IN THIS STRAIN RANGE THE SOIL EXHIBITS NON LINEAR STRESS STRAIN BEHAVIOUR, WHICH SHOULD BE INCORPORATED IN ANY DEFORMATION ANALYSIS. IN ORDER TO CAPTURE THE POSSIBLE VARIABILITY IN THE NON LINEAR BEHAVIOUR OF VARIOUS SANDS, A DATABASE WAS CONSTRUCTED INCLUDING THE SECANT SHEAR MODULUS DEGRADATION CURVES OF 454 TESTS FROM THE LITERATURE. BY OBTAINING A UNIQUE S SHAPED CURVE OF SHEAR MODULUS DEGRADATION, A MODIFIED HYPERBOLIC RELATIONSHIP WAS FITTED. THE THREE CURVE FITTING PARAMETERS ARE: AN ELASTIC THRESHOLD STRAIN GAMMAE, UP TO WHICH THE ELASTIC SHEAR MODULUS IS EFFECTIVELY CONSTANT AT G0; A REFERENCE STRAIN GAMMAR, DEFINED AS THE SHEAR STRAIN AT WHICH THE SECANT MODULUS HAS REDUCED TO 0.5G0; AND A CURVATURE PARAMETER A, WHICH CONTROLS THE RATE OF MODULUS REDUCTION. THE TWO CHARACTERISTIC STRAINS GAMMAE AND GAMMAR WERE FOUND TO VARY WITH SAND TYPE (I.E. UNIFORMITY COEFFICIENT), SOIL STATE (I.E. VOID RATIO, RELATIVE DENSITY) AND MEAN EFFECTIVE STRESS. THE NEW EMPIRICAL EXPRESSION FOR SHEAR MODULUS REDUCTION G/G0 IS SHOWN TO MAKE PREDICTIONS THAT ARE ACCURATE WITHIN A FACTOR OF 1.13 FOR ONE STANDARD DEVIATION OF RANDOM ERROR, AS DETERMINED FROM 3860 DATA POINTS. THE INITIAL ELASTIC SHEAR MODULUS, G0, SHOULD ALWAYS BE MEASURED IF POSSIBLE, BUT A NEW EMPIRICAL RELATION IS SHOWN TO PROVIDE ESTIMATES WITHIN A FACTOR OF 1.6 FOR ONE STANDARD DEVIATION OF RANDOM ERROR, AS DETERMINED FROM 379 TESTS. THE NEW EXPRESSIONS FOR NON LINEAR DEFORMATION ARE EASY TO APPLY IN PRACTICE, AND SHOULD BE USEFUL IN THE ANALYSIS OF GEOTECHNICAL STRUCTURES UNDER STATIC LOADING.

IN FACT, STRUCTURE IS THE DOMINANT FACTOR DETERMINING THE DIFFERENCES IN THE MECHANICAL RESPONSE OF DIFFERENT UNITS. IN THE PAPER, NUMERICAL ANALYSES SIMULATING THE UNDRAINED EXCAVATION OF A TUNNEL IN ST JAMESS PARK ARE PRESENTED. LONDON CLAY BEHAVIOUR IS CHARACTERISED BY A KINEMATIC HARDENING STRUCTURED SOIL MODEL INCORPORATING STRUCTURE AND STIFFNESS DEGRADATION. THE PARAMETERS AND INITIAL CONDITIONS ARE BASED ON A CAREFUL CALIBRATION THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE PRESENCE OF DIFFERENT UNITS WITHIN THE LONDON CLAY FORMATION AND THE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF SOIL STRUCTURE. THE ANALYSES PERFORMED RESULT IN A VERY SATISFACTORY REPRODUCTION OF THE MAGNITUDE AND PATTERNS OF SHORT TERM SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE DISPLACEMENTS, AS WELL AS PORE PRESSURES. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH A DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS IN THE CONTEXT OF OTHER ANALYSES PERFORMED PREVIOUSLY, AND PUTS FORWARD SOME CONSIDERATIONS CONCERNING DESIGN ISSUES.

NINE CENTRIFUGE TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT ON REDUCED SCALE MODELS OF PAIRS OF RETAINING WALLS IN DRY SAND, EITHER CANTILEVERED OR WITH ONE LEVEL OF PROPS NEAR THE TOP. THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA INDICATE THAT, FOR MAXIMUM ACCELERATIONS THAT ARE SMALLER THAN THE CRITICAL LIMIT EQUILIBRIUM VALUE, THE RETAINING WALLS EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT PERMANENT DISPLACEMENTS UNDER INCREASING STRUCTURAL LOADS, WHEREAS FOR LARGER ACCELERATIONS THE WALLS ROTATE UNDER CONSTANT INTERNAL FORCES. THE CRITICAL ACCELERATION AT WHICH THE WALLS START TO ROTATE INCREASES WITH INCREASING MAXIMUM ACCELERATION. NO SIGNIFICANT DISPLACEMENTS ARE MEASURED IF THE CURRENT EARTHQUAKE IS LESS SEVERE THAN EARTHQUAKES PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED BY THE WALL. THE INCREASE OF CRITICAL ACCELERATION IS EXPLAINED IN TERMS OF REDISTRIBUTION OF EARTH PRESSURES AND PROGRESSIVE MOBILISATION OF THE PASSIVE STRENGTH IN FRONT OF THE WALL. THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA FOR CANTILEVERED RETAINING WALLS INDICATE THAT THE PERMANENT DISPLACEMENTS OF THE WALL CAN BE REASONABLY PREDICTED ADOPTING A NEWMARK TYPE CALCULATION WITH A CRITICAL ACCELERATION THAT IS A FRACTION OF THE LIMIT EQUILIBRIUM VALUE.

YANG J., WEI L.M.	COLLAPSE OF LOOSE SAND WITH THE ADDITION OF FINES: THE ROLE OF PARTICLE SHAPE	2012	GEOTECHNIQUE	62	12		1111	1125		3	HTTP://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URL?EID2 S2.0 84871073026&PARTNERID40&MD5ADAB383B3CC7C574CB79A9400886E99A	DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, THE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG, HONG KONG	YANG, J., DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, THE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG, HONG KONG; WEI, L.M., DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, THE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG, HONG KONG	THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A FUNDAMENTAL STUDY TO EXPLORE THE ROLE OF PARTICLE SHAPE IN THE SHEAR BEHAVIOUR OF MIXTURES OF SAND AND FINE PARTICLES (FINES) THROUGH MACRO SCALE AND GRAIN SCALE LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS TOGETHER WITH INTERPRETATIONS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF CRITICAL STATE SOIL MECHANICS AND CONCEPTUAL MICROMECHANICS MODELS. TWO NON PLASTIC FINES OF DISTINCT SHAPE (ANGULAR CRUSHED SILICA FINES AND ROUNDED GLASS BEADS) WERE ADDED TO TWO UNIFORM QUARTZ SANDS (TOYOURA SAND AND FUJIAN SAND) TO PRODUCE FOUR BINARY MIXTURES. LABORATORY QUANTIFICATION OF PARTICLE SHAPE AND SIZE WAS CONDUCTED FOR BOTH FINES AND SANDS, AND A SERIES OF UNDRAINED TRIAXIAL TESTS WAS PERFORMED TO INVESTIGATE THE OVERALL RESPONSE OF THE MIXED SOILS AT DIFFERENT PERCENTAGES OF FINES. ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS IS THAT THE CRITICAL STATE FRICTION ANGLE OF A MIXED SOIL IS AFFECTED NOT ONLY BY THE SHAPE OF COARSE PARTICLES BUT ALSO BY THE SHAPE OF FINE PARTICLES, AND THIS SHAPE EFFECT IS COUPLED WITH FINES CONTENT. WHEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF CRUSHED SILICA FINES WAS ADDED TO EITHER TOYOURA SAND OR FUJIAN SAND, THE CRITICAL STATE FRICTION ANGLE INCREASED SLIGHTLY WITH FINES CONTENT; HOWEVER, WHEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF GLASS BEADS WAS ADDED TO EITHER SAND, THE CRITICAL STATE FRICTION ANGLE DECREASED MARKEDLY WITH AN INCREASE IN FINES CONTENT. A NEW INDEX, TERMED COMBINED ROUNDNESS, IS PROPOSED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE COUPLED EFFECTS OF PARTICLE SHAPE AND FINES CONTENT. THE STUDY ALSO PROVIDES EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT THE UNDRAINED SHEAR BEHAVIOUR AND COLLAPSIBILITY OF A MIXED SOIL ARE CLOSELY RELATED TO THE SHAPE OF ITS CONSTITUENT PARTICLES: A MIXED SOIL CONTAINING ROUNDED FINES TENDS TO EXHIBIT HIGHER SUSCEPTIBILITY TO COLLAPSE THAN A MIXED SOIL CONTAINING ANGULAR FINES OF THE SAME PERCENTAGE, AND THIS TENDENCY WILL BECOME MORE EVIDENT IF THE BASE SAND IS ALSO COMPOSED OF ROUNDED PARTICLES. IN ADDITION, THE STUDY PROVIDES THE FIRST EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT THE QUASI STEADY STATE MARKS A TRANSITION FROM A METASTABLE TO A STABLE MICROSTRUCTURE. IT IS POSTULATED THAT IN A BINARY MIXTURE COMPOSED OF FINE AND COARSE PARTICLES THAT ARE BOTH ROUNDED, THE PARTICLES FAVOUR ROLLING, THUS YIELDING A MICROSTRUCTURE THAT IS UNSTABLE, WHEREAS IN A BINARY MIXTURE COMPOSED OF FINE AND COARSE PARTICLES THAT ARE BOTH ANGULAR, THE PARTICLES FAVOUR SLIDING RATHER THAN ROLLING, THUS LEADING TO A MUCH MORE STABLE STRUCTURE AND RESPONSE.

DIFFERENT INITIAL WATER CONTENTS (5.0, 9.0 AND 13.5%) WERE CONSIDERED. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE FAILURE ENVELOPE IS LINEAR FOR THE PEAK DEVIATOR STRESS BUT HIGHLY NON LINEAR FOR THE RESIDUAL DEVIATOR STRESS IN THE RANGE OF HIGH NORMAL STRESSES (HIGHER THAN 400 KPA), EVIDENCING THE PARTICLE CRUSHING EFFECT ON THE RESIDUAL STRENGTH. FURTHERMORE, THIS PARTICLE CRUSHING EFFECT WAS DEPENDENT ON WATER CONTENT: THE RESIDUAL FRICTION ANGLE IS LARGER AT HIGHER WATER CONTENT. FURTHER GRAIN SIZE ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ON THE PORTION TAKEN IN THE ZONE OF SHEAR BAND AFTER EACH TEST, AND CHANGES OF THE FRACTIONS OF 75 MIM AND 2 MIM WERE COMPARED FOR DIFFERENT WATER CONTENTS. THE RESULTS INDICATE CLEARLY THAT THE EFFECT OF WATER CONTENT ON PARTICLE CRUSHING DEPENDS ON PARTICLE SIZE. FOR LARGE PARTICLES (> 75 MIM), WATER CONTENT INCREASE ENHANCES THE PARTICLE CRUSHING BY THE FRACTURE MECHANISM. ON THE CONTRARY, FOR SMALLER PARTICLES (< 2 MIM), WATER CONTENT INCREASE REDUCES THE PARTICLE CRUSHING BY THE MECHANISM OF ATTRITION OR ABRASION. DEEPER ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF THE RATIO OF THE FINAL TO INITIAL FRACTION OF SOIL WITH PARTICLE SIZE LESS THAN 2 MIM, S2, ON THE SHEAR STRENGTH SUGGESTS THAT THE EFFECT OF PARTICLE CRUSHING ON THE RESIDUAL SHEAR STRENGTH IS MAINLY THROUGH THE PRODUCTION OF EXTRA CLAY SIZE PARTICLES (< 2 MIM).

AMONG MANY DAMAGE MECHANISMS, THE PRESENT STUDY ADDRESSES THOSE INDUCED BY SEISMIC FAULT ACTION AND ITS RELATED GROUND DISTORTION. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS INFLUENCING THE FORCES ACTING ON BURIED PIPELINES DUE TO IMPOSED GROUND DISPLACEMENTS WILL PERMIT MORE APPROPRIATE DESIGN OF PIPELINES IN THE FUTURE, AND CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS REDUCING DAMAGE INCURRED BY THE BURIED PIPES. TO THIS END, 1G SHAKING TABLE EXPERIMENTS WERE PERFORMED ON BURIED MODEL PIPELINES INSTALLED IN TOYOURA SAND, WHICH WERE INSTRUMENTED TO MONITOR STRAIN. THE SYSTEM WAS SUBJECTED TO FOUR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DYNAMIC EXCITATION AND RIGHT LATERAL STRIKE SLIP FAULTING. THE EXPERIMENTS INDICATE THAT SIMULTANEOUS SHAKING AND FAULTING, WHICH IS A MORE REALISTIC CONDITION THAN TESTS PERFORMED WITHOUT SHAKING, REDUCE THE MEASURED PIPE STRAINS. TESTS ALSO INDICATED THAT THERE IS A LINEAR DECREASE IN THE MAXIMUM STRAINS EXPERIENCED BY THE BURIED PIPE AS THE SINE OF THE PIPEFAULT CROSSING ANGLE DECREASES, AND THAT THERE IS A NONLINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RELATIVE DENSITY AND THE STRAINS EXPERIENCED BY THE BURIED PIPE.

THEREFORE THE INCLUSION OF A SAFETY FACTOR WITHIN AN ADVANCED ANALYSIS METHOD, SUCH AS FINITE ELEMENTS OR FINITE DIFFERENCES, IS A MORE COMPLEX ISSUE. IN PARTICULAR, THE PROBLEM ARISES WITH DESIGN CODES, SUCH AS EUROCODE 7, IN WHICH PARTIAL FACTORS ON SOIL STRENGTH (OR PARTIAL MATERIAL FACTORS) MUST BE ACCOUNTED FOR. EUROCODE 7 IMPLIES THAT A NUMERICAL ANALYSIS SHOULD BE PERFORMED ACCOUNTING FOR A CHARACTERISTIC STRENGTH, WHICH IS REDUCED BY PARTIAL FACTORS. THERE ARE TWO WAYS IN WHICH SUCH PARTIAL FACTORS CAN BE INCLUDED IN NUMERICAL ANALYSIS: ONE IN WHICH THE STRENGTH IS REDUCED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ANALYSIS, AND THE OTHER IN WHICH THIS IS DONE DURING THE ANALYSIS. EUROCODE 7 GIVES NO GUIDANCE AS TO WHICH ONE OF THESE TWO APPROACHES IS MORE APPROPRIATE TO APPLY. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THERE IS NO GUIDANCE ON THE APPROPRIATE NUMERICAL PROCEDURE THAT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN ANY SOFTWARE IN ORDER TO PERFORM THE REQUIRED STRENGTH REDUCTION DURING THE ANALYSIS IN THE LATTER APPROACH. THEREFORE DIFFERENT SOFTWARE PROGRAMS ACCOUNT FOR THIS IN DIFFERENT WAYS, AND MOSTLY ONLY FOR SIMPLE CONSTITUTIVE MODELS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS, FIRST, A CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY FOR ACCOUNTING FOR PARTIAL MATERIAL FACTORS IN FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS, WHICH CAN BE APPLIED TO ANY CONSTITUTIVE MODEL. IT THEN DEMONSTRATES THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE TWO WAYS THE PARTIAL MATERIAL FACTORS CAN BE INTRODUCED IN ANY ANALYSIS, USING THE EXAMPLE OF A BEARING CAPACITY PROBLEM AND EMPLOYING CONSTITUTIVE MODELS OF INCREASING COMPLEXITY. THE PAPER SHOWS THAT THE TWO APPROACHES FOR ACCOUNTING FOR PARTIAL MATERIAL FACTORS MAY LEAD TO DIFFERENT RESULTS, AND THAT IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO DEVELOP A RATIONAL SET OF GUIDELINES FOR THEIR INCLUSION IN ADVANCED NUMERICAL ANALYSIS.

SUCH A MECHANISM IS ABLE TO CHANGE THE MOBILITY OF A FLOW SIGNIFICANTLY, THROUGH RAPID CHANGES OF THE FLOW VOLUME AND RHEOLOGY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO USE MATHEMATICAL, RHEOLOGICAL AND CONSTITUTIVE MODELS TO ANALYSE THE ENTRAINMENT EFFECT ON RUNOUT ANALYSIS RESULTS. AFTER A BRIEF REVIEW AND CLASSIFICATION OF SOME WELL ESTABLISHED EROSION LAWS, A SIMPLE, YET EFFECTIVE, EMPIRICAL FORMULA FOR THE ENTRAINMENT RATE HAS BEEN SELECTED, AND IS IMPLEMENTED IN A CONTINUUM MECHANICS BASED NUMERICAL MODEL. FIRST, SOME HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES ARE USED TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE IMPLEMENTED ENTRAINMENT PROCESS, AND TO EVIDENCE THE RESPECTIVE ROLE OF ENTRAINMENT AND TOPOGRAPHY ON A FLOW PROPAGATION. THEN A BACK ANALYSIS IS PRESENTED OF THE 2000 TSING SHAN EVENT (HONG KONG), WHERE A SMALL VOLUME OF 150 M3 OF MATERIAL GREW TO 1620 M3 BECAUSE OF THE STRONG EROSION ALONG THE SLOPE. FROM THE RESULTS OBTAINED, IT EMERGES THAT THE NEW MODEL WITH EROSION IMPLEMENTED CAN PROVIDE A USEFUL CONTRIBUTION IN DESCRIBING THE CONSEQUENCES OF MASS MOVEMENTS IN WHICH THE ENTRAINMENT PROCESS CAN PLAY A KEY ROLE.

IN THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY, THE BEHAVIOUR OF AN AXIALLY LOADED PILE UNDER THERMAL CYCLES WAS INVESTIGATED USING A PHYSICAL MODEL. AFTER APPLYING THE AXIAL LOAD ON THE PILE HEAD, THE PILE WAS HEATED FROM 25C TO 50C AND SUBSEQUENTLY COOLED TO 25C. FOUR TESTS (CORRESPONDING TO FOUR VALUES OF AXIAL LOAD) WERE PERFORMED AND TWO TEMPERATURE CYCLES WERE UNDERTAKEN IN EACH TEST. THE PILE TEMPERATURE AND THE PILE HEAD DISPLACEMENT WERE MONITORED. WHEN LOW AXIAL LOADS WERE APPLIED, THE HEATING INDUCED HEAVE AND COOLING INDUCED SETTLEMENT OF THE PILE HEAD. IN THIS CASE, THE DISPLACEMENT TEMPERATURE CURVE WAS FOUND TO BE REVERSIBLE AND SIMILAR TO THE THERMAL EXPANSION CURVE OF THE PILE. HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF HIGHER AXIAL LOADS, THE HEAVE OF THE PILE HEAD, OBTAINED DURING HEATING, WAS LOWER THAN THE THERMAL EXPANSION OF THE PILE, SUGGESTING SETTLEMENT OF THE PILE TOE. IRREVERSIBLE SETTLEMENT OF THE PILE HEAD WAS OBSERVED AFTER THESE THERMAL CYCLES.

DE OBRAS Y SERVICIOS COPASA, SPAIN	A LIMIT EQUILIBRIUM BASED TECHNIQUE IS PROPOSED FOR THE DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF DRYSTONE MASONRY RETAINING WALLS, FOCUSING PARTICULARLY ON GRANITE WALLS AS TRADITIONALLY CONSTRUCTED IN GALICIA IN NORTHWEST SPAIN. TO DATE, WALLS HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN DESIGNED ON THE BASIS OF PAST EXPERIENCE AND RIGID WALL APPROACHES. THE METHOD PRESENTED ANALYSES WALL STABILITY, AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH BLOCK ROWS, AGAINST SLIDING AND AGAINST TWO OVERTURNING MECHANISMS. AS A RESULT, DESIGN WIDTHS ARE OBTAINED FOR DIFFERENT WALL DEPTHS. THE METHOD CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO ESTIMATES OF THE STABILITY OF EXISTING WALLS WITH KNOWN DIMENSIONS AND PROPERTIES. THE ANALYTICAL METHOD WAS APPLIED EXPERIMENTALLY TO THE DESIGN OF A 20 M HIGH WALL. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF THE DESIGN WAS ALSO PERFORMED, WITH RESULTS PRESENTED IN THE FORM OF A SPIDER DIAGRAM. ESTIMATES OF THE MOST RELEVANT PARAMETERS FOR THIS TYPE OF DESIGN AND SOME BACK ANALYSES TO ASSESS THE TECHNIQUE ARE ADDRESSED IN AN ACCOMPANYING PAPER.

PARTICULAR ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO ESTIMATING RELEVANT PARAMETERS FOR THE MATERIALS USED. THE FRICTION ANGLE BETWEEN THE STONE BLOCKS WAS STUDIED BY MEANS OF FULLSCALE TESTS, AND AN EMPIRICAL METHOD WAS USED TO ESTIMATE THE BACKFILL STRENGTH PROPERTIES. THE DIP OF THE BASE OF THE PART OF THE WALL TENDING TO OVERTURN WAS ALSO STUDIED. THE TECHNIQUE WAS TESTED BY BACK ANALYSING THREE WALL FAILURES, AND WAS COMPARED WITH NUMERICAL RESULTS FROM THE UDEC CODE, SUGGESTED AS AN APPROPRIATE APPROACH FOR ASSESSING ANALYTICAL RESULTS. ANALYTICAL FACTOR OF SAFETY RESULTS FOR THE DESIGN OF A 20 M HIGH WALL COMPARED WELL WITH THE NUMERICAL APPROACH USED IN COMBINATION WITH THE SHEAR STRENGTH REDUCTION TECHNIQUE. THE RESULTS CONFIRM THE SUITABILITY OF THE LIMIT EQUILIBRIUM APPROACH FOR ANALYSING THESE TRADITIONAL, COST EFFECTIVE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY STRUCTURES.

THE CPTS WERE PERFORMED AT THREE DIFFERENT CENTRIFUGE G LEVELS AND TWO DIFFERENT RELATIVE DENSITIES. A PARALLEL SERIES OF SHEAR BOX TESTS ALLOWED DETERMINATION OF THE MATERIALS SHEARING CHARACTERISTICS, AND LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN EXPRESSION FOR PEAK FRICTION ANGLE THAT INCORPORATES THE INFLUENCE OF PARTICLE SHAPE. A SIMPLE APPROACH TO PREDICT THE CPT END RESISTANCE EMPLOYING THIS EXPRESSION IS SHOWN TO MATCH THE MEASURED CENTRIFUGE CPT DATA AND HENCE ASSIST WITH QUANTIFICATION OF THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PARTICLE SHAPE ON THE CPT END RESISTANCE.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN ANALYTICAL SOLUTION FOR NON LINEAR RADIAL CONSOLIDATION UNDER EQUAL STRAIN CONDITIONS INCORPORATING SMEAR BUT IGNORING WELL RESISTANCE. THREE ASPECTS OF NON LINEARITY ARE CONSIDERED: (A) NON DARCIAN FLOW, (B) A LOG LINEAR VOID RATIO STRESS RELATIONSHIP; AND (B) A LOG LINEAR VOID RATIO PERMEABILITY RELATIONSHIP. THE ANALYTICAL SOLUTION TO NON LINEAR RADIAL CONSOLIDATION CAN EXPLICITLY CAPTURE THE BEHAVIOUR OF BOTH OVERCONSOLIDATED AND NORMALLY CONSOLIDATED SOILS. FOR NON LINEAR MATERIAL PROPERTIES, CONSOLIDATION MAY BE FASTER OR SLOWER WHEN COMPARED WITH THE CASES WITH CONSTANT MATERIAL PROPERTIES. THE DIFFERENCE DEPENDS ON THE COMPRESSIBILITY/ PERMEABILITY RATIOS (CC/CK AND CR/CK), THE PRECONSOLIDATION PRESSURE AND THE STRESS INCREASE. IF CC/CK &LT; 1 OR CR/CK &LT; 1 THEN THE COEFFICIENT OF CONSOLIDATION INCREASES AS EXCESS PORE PRESSURES DISSIPATE, AND THE CORRESPONDING RATE OF CONSOLIDATION IS GREATER.

LARGE FRAGMENTS OF THIS EVOLVING MATERIAL REMAINED AFTER THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS, AND THEIR DEGRADATION WAS OF CONCERN BECAUSE OF THE EXPECTED CHANGE OF THE ENGINEERING PROPERTIES OF THE COMPACTED MATERIAL. THE MATERIAL EXHIBITS A VERY COMPLEX BEHAVIOUR, WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO REPRODUCE WITH EXISTING CONSTITUTIVE MODELS FOR UNSATURATED STRUCTURED MATERIALS. THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON UNDERSTANDING AND PROVIDING DATA ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE PURE MARLS (ROCK) AND THE AGGREGATE BEHAVIOUR. IT PRESENTS THE MAIN RESULTS OF TESTS PERFORMED TO CHARACTERISE THE HYDRO MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF COMPACTED MARLS IN SPECIMENS PREPARED WITH DIFFERENT GRADING SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS AND SUBJECTED TO OEDOMETER TESTS WHERE BOTH STRESS AND SUCTION CHANGES WERE APPLIED. THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA OBTAINED WERE ANALYSED, CONSIDERING THE PRESENCE OF FRAGMENTS AND THEIR DEGRADATION. THE MARL MATRIX WAS CHARACTERISED TO COMPLETE THE EXISTING DATA PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED FOR THIS MATERIAL, BUT NOW WITH THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING A BETTER EXPLANATION FOR THE VOLUMETRIC BEHAVIOUR OF THE AGGREGATE. THE DISCUSSION IS ASSISTED BY THE EXPLANATION PROVIDED BY A SIMPLE ELASTO PLASTIC MODEL FOR UNSATURATED SOILS. DISCREPANCIES WITH MODEL PREDICTIONS HELP TO HIGHLIGHT THE SINGULARITY OF THE MARL AGGREGATE. COMPACTED MARLS BEHAVE AS MATERIALS IN THE TRANSITION BETWEEN ROCKFILL (WHEN THE FRAGMENTS REMAIN BRITTLE) AND A CLAYEY SOIL (WHEN THE DEGRADATION ACCUMULATES). THEREFORE THE COMPACTED MARL EXHIBITS A DUAL BEHAVIOUR. IF IT IS DRY, DEFORMATIONS ARE EXPLAINED BY THE BREAKAGE OF PARTICLES AND REARRANGEMENT OF THE STRUCTURE. IF IT IS WET, THE COMPACTED MARL IS DOMINATED BY BOND DEGRADATION OF THE MATERIAL, THE RELEASE OF SWELLING POTENTIAL AND SIMULTANEOUS CHANGES IN THE STIFFNESS AND STRENGTH OF THE FRAGMENTS. IT APPEARS THAT THE TRANSITION FROM DRY TO WET CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY THE CURRENT SUCTION; MOREOVER, IT IS RATHER ABRUPT.

THIS STUDY ADDRESSES A SIMPLE MODEL OF SMALL STRAIN STIFFNESS AND SALT CONCENTRATION BASED ON THE WAVE MEASUREMENTS OF SALT CEMENTED PARTICULATE MEDIA. GLASS BEADS WITH A MEDIAN DIAMETER OF D50 0.5 MM ARE PREPARED IN RECTANGULAR CELLS USING THE WATER PLUVIATED METHOD IN SALT WATER WITH DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS. PIEZO DISC ELEMENTS AND BENDER ELEMENTS EMBEDDED IN THE CELL ARE USED FOR THE MEASUREMENTS OF THE COMPRESSIONAL AND SHEAR WAVES. THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE ELASTIC WAVE VELOCITIES AND SALT CONCENTRATION SHOW AN EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION. THE MEASURED SMALL STRAIN STIFFNESS MATCHES WELL THE PREDICTED SMALL STRAIN STIFFNESS BASED ON THE MICROMECHANICS OF SIMPLE CUBIC MONOSIZED SPHERICAL PARTICLES. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE SALT CONCENTRATION IN A SALTCEMENTED SPECIMEN CAN BE EVALUATED BY USING ELASTIC WAVE VELOCITIES.

SHAKEDOWN IMPLIES THAT THE PAVEMENT RESPONDS TO LOADING IN A RESILIENT MANNER AFTER SOME LIMITED PLASTIC DEFORMATION DURING THE EARLY LOAD APPLICATIONS. THE DATA WERE USED TO ASSESS THE VALIDITY OF APPLYING THREE DIMENSIONAL LOWER BOUND SHAKEDOWN THEORY TO PAVEMENTS AS A BASIS FOR IMPROVING PAVEMENT DESIGN COMPUTATIONS. THE RESEARCH INDICATED THAT THIS APPROACH HAS CONSIDERABLE PROMISE, AND THAT FURTHER EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION WORK IS DESIRABLE.

H., DEPARTMENT OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING, NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, TAIPEI, TAIWAN	IN THIS PAPER, A MATHEMATICALLY RIGOROUS PROCESS IS ADOPTED TO DERIVE A PIEZOCONE PENETRATION TEST (CPTU) BASED MODEL FOR ASSESSING THE PROBABILITY OF LIQUEFACTION/ CYCLIC SOFTENING. THE NEW PROBABILISTIC MODEL IS EXPRESSED IN THE FORM OF A MAPPING FUNCTION THAT RELATES THE LIQUEFACTION PROBABILITY MATHEMATICALLY TO THE FACTOR OF SAFETY OBTAINED FROM A PUBLISHED DETERMINISTIC CPTUBASED MODEL. THE NEW MODEL IS NOVEL BECAUSE IT IS APPLICABLE TO BOTH SAND AND CLAY, IS MORE DIRECT (IN TERMS OF THE USAGE OF CPTU DATA), IS MORE CONSISTENT WITH A MECHANICS FRAMEWORK, AND ALLOWS COMPLETE LIQUEFACTION ASSESSMENT (AT LEAST FOR INITIAL SCREENING) WITHOUT RECOURSE TO ADDITIONAL SAMPLING AND LABORATORY TESTING. POSSIBLE VARIATION OF THE MODEL CAUSED BY THE VARIABILITY OF THE ADOPTED DATABASE IS INVESTIGATED AND REPORTED. FINALLY, EXAMPLES ARE PROVIDED TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THE PROPOSED MODEL IS APPLIED IN A FUTURE EVENT CONSIDERING BOTH MODEL AND PARAMETER UNCERTAINTIES.

THE DIAPHRAGM WALL RETAINS A 14.5 M DEEP MULTI PROPPED EXCAVATION IN SOFT CLAYS IN SHANGHAI, P. R. CHINA. AT THIS GREENFIELD SITE, THE MAXIMUM GROUND SURFACE SETTLEMENT (DELTAV MAX) AT THE END OF EXCAVATION RANGED FROM 0.25% TO 0.32% OF THE FINAL EXCAVATION DEPTH (HE), AND THE INFLUENCE ZONE OF GROUND SURFACE SETTLEMENT WAS MORE THAN 2.5HE BEHIND THE WALL. BOTH THE MEASURED DELTAV MAX AND THE INFLUENCE ZONE OF GROUND SETTLEMENTS AT THIS SITE ARE GENERALLY LARGER THAN FOR EXCAVATIONS IN OTHER, MORE DENSELY BUILT AREAS OF SHANGHAI. FORCE AND MOMENT EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSES OF THE INSTRUMENTED PANEL VALIDATE THE RELIABILITY OF THE MEASURED EARTH PRESSURES AND PROP FORCES. THE MEASURED PROP LOADS FROM THIS GREENFIELD SITE ARE GENERALLY LARGER THAN THOSE REPORTED FROM SIMILAR EXCAVATIONS IN SHANGHAI. EARTH PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS REVEAL THAT CONCRETING OF THE DIAPHRAGM WALL PANEL INCREASED THE LATERAL EARTH PRESSURE COEFFICIENTS AT THE SOIL/ WALL INTERFACE BY A FACTOR OF MORE THAN 1.4. THE STRESS PATHS FOR THE RETAINED SOIL WITHIN THE PROPPED REGION GENERALLY MOVED TOWARDS THE PASSIVE STATE DURING THE LAST FEW STAGES OF MAIN EXCAVATION, AND SOIL NEAR THE FORMATION LEVEL APPROACHED THE PASSIVE FAILURE STATE PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF EXCAVATION.

A REINFORCEDCONCRETE (RC) SPHERE (MASS 850 KG, DIAMETER 0.9 M) WAS DROPPED (FALLING HEIGHT RANGING BETWEEN 5 M AND 45 M) ON A TUNNEL ALONG A ROAD IN THE DOLOMITES. THIS EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAMME REPRESENTS THE EXTENSION OF A PREVIOUS ONE, PERFORMED AT POLITECNICO DI MILANO (CAMPUS BOVISA), WHEN THE SAME RC SPHERE WAS DROPPED ON A CIRCULAR POOL FILLED WITH A LOOSE SAND STRATUM. THE NEW PROGRAMME IS CHARACTERISED BY LARGER FALLING HEIGHTS AND THE MONITORING OF THE MECHANICAL RESPONSE OF THE SHELTER. A SERIES OF INSTRUMENTS HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED TO MEASURE IMPACT FORCES, STRESS PROPAGATION WITHIN THE ABSORBING SOIL STRATUM ON TOP OF THE SHELTER, AND ITS DEFLECTION. THE RESULTS, WHICH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH AVAILABLE LITERATURE DATA, ARE PRESENTED WITH THE AIM OF HIGHLIGHTING THE FEATURES OF THE COMPLEX IMPACT EVENT AND DISCUSSING THE ENGINEERING FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED FOR CONCEIVING A REALISTIC AND RELIABLE DESIGN APPROACH. THE MAIN CONCLUSION IS THAT THE IMPACT FORCE IS UNAFFECTED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE PLATE, AND THAT THE STRESS INCREMENT ON THE STRUCTURE IS SLIGHTLY REDUCED BY THE STRUCTURE DEFLECTION, WHICH CAN BE NEGLECTED FOR DESIGN PURPOSES WITHOUT UNREASONABLE LEVELS OF CONSERVATISM BEING INTRODUCED.

A ROBUST NUMERICAL METHOD WILL BE DESCRIBED HERE FOR DEALING WITH SUCH COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT PROBLEMS. THE APPROACH IS BASED ON THE ARBITRARY LAGRANGIAN EULERIAN (ALE) METHOD OF ANALYSIS, THE MAIN FEATURES AND CHALLENGES OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BRIEFLY IN THE PAPER. THE ALE METHOD IS THEN EMPLOYED TO PERFORM A PARAMETRIC STUDY OF A PERFECTLY SMOOTH PENETROMETER FREE FALLING INTO A UNIFORM LAYER OF CLAY, WHICH DEFORMS UNDER UNDRAINED CONDITIONS. THE EFFECT OF THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE CLAY SOIL ON THE PENETRATION CHARACTERISTICS IS PRESENTED, AND AN APPROXIMATE, CLOSED FORM EXPRESSION IS DERIVED FOR THE DYNAMIC PENETRATION FACTOR, NDP: COMPARISONS ARE MADE BETWEEN THE DEDUCED VALUES OF NDP AND PUBLISHED VALUES OF THE CONVENTIONAL CONE FACTOR, NC, AND COMPARISONS ARE MADE WITH EXPERIMENTAL DATA TO VALIDATE THE APPROACH.

THREE MODES OF PIPING BEHAVIOUR WERE RECOGNISED: CONCENTRATED LEAK EROSION, BACKWARD EROSION, AND SUFFUSION. THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF THE FINES PRESENT IN THE SOILS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED THE INITIATION AND MODE OF PIPING. THE PRESENCE OF NON PLASTIC FINES SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE REQUIRED SEEPAGE VELOCITY TO INITIATE PIPING (CRITICAL SEEPAGE VELOCITY), WHEREAS THE PRESENCE OF PLASTIC FINES GREATLY INCREASED THE HYDRAULIC GRADIENT REQUIRED TO INITIATE PIPING. CONCENTRATED LEAK EROSION OCCURRED ALONG THE SOIL/APPARATUS INTERFACE IN SOILS WITH PLASTIC FINES AT VERY LOW SEEPAGE VELOCITY, BUT REQUIRED VERY HIGH HYDRAULIC GRADIENTS. BACKWARD EROSION WAS THE PRIMARY MODE OF FAILURE IN NON COHESIVE SOILS, AND THIS MODE REQUIRED A SEEPAGE VELOCITY OF 0.8 1.1 CM/S TO INITIATE PIPING IN UNIFORM SAND. THE CRITICAL SEEPAGE VELOCITY WAS FOUND TO DEPEND ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE STRESS STATE, PORE PRESSURE, INITIAL VOID RATIO, AND SEEPAGE DIRECTION. IT IS FOUND THAT AN INCREASE IN MAXIMUM PRINCIPAL STRESS AND SEEPAGE ANGLE AND A DECREASE IN VOID RATIO CAUSED AN INCREASE IN THE CRITICAL SEEPAGE VELOCITY, WHEREAS THE MINOR AND INTERMEDIATE PRINCIPAL STRESSES DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON PIPING INITIATION. HOWEVER, THE INFLUENCE OF INTERMEDIATE AND MINOR PRINCIPAL STRESSES MAY BE IMPORTANT FOR PLASTIC SOILS PRONE TO HYDRAULIC FRACTURING. SUFFUSION WAS THE PRIMARY MODE OF PIPING IN SOILS THAT CONTAIN VERY FINE NON PLASTIC FINES. INITIATION OF SUFFUSION REQUIRED SEEPAGE VELOCITY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE LESS THAN THAT REQUIRED TO INDUCE BACKWARD EROSION. ONCE SUFFUSION INITIATED, IT PROGRESSED TO BACKWARD EROSION OF THE SOIL SKELETON AT MUCH LOWER SEEPAGE VELOCITY THAN REQUIRED FOR SIMILAR SOILS WITHOUT NONPLASTIC FINES.

SPECIAL TRIAXIAL TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT ON NATURAL SEDIMENTS RECOVERED FROM THE GULF OF GUINEA. SPECIAL ATTENTION WAS DEVOTED TO THE LABORATORY PREPARATION PROCEDURE, INVOLVING SATURATION OF NATURAL MARINE SEDIMENT SAMPLES WITH CARBONATED WATER AND GENERATION OF FREE GAS FOLLOWING UNDRAINED UNLOADING. EXPERIMENTAL DATA SHOW THAT SOIL DESTRUCTURATION AND DAMAGE GENERATED BY GAS EXPANSION AND EXSOLUTION ARE AT THE ORIGIN OF (A) THE INCREASE IN THE ISOTROPIC COMPRESSIBILITY AND DECREASE IN THE PRECONSOLIDATION PRESSURE, AND (B) THE DECREASE IN THE PEAK UNDRAINED STRENGTH AND ABRUPT INCREASE OF THE PORE PRESSURE DURING UNDRAINED SHEARING. THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA ALSO SHOW THAT FLOODING OF GAS BUBBLES AND DISSOLUTION OF FREE GAS DO NOT IMPLY A COMPLETE STRENGTH RECOVERY OF NATURAL SEDIMENTS.

THE PIPE IS CONSIDERED TO BE WISHED IN PLACE AT INVERT PENETRATIONS RANGING FROM ZERO TO FIVE PIPE DIAMETERS, THUS PROVIDING COVERAGE OF BOTH ON BOTTOM (PARTIALLY EMBEDDED) AND TRENCHED (FULLY EMBEDDED) OFFSHORE PIPELINES. THE SOIL IS MODELLED AS A RIGID PLASTIC TRESCA MATERIAL WITH EITHER UNIFORM STRENGTH OR STRENGTH PROPORTIONAL TO DEPTH. THE EFFECTS OF SOIL WEIGHT, INTERFACE ROUGHNESS AND INTERFACE TENSILE CAPACITY ARE INVESTIGATED IN A SYSTEMATIC MANNER. ALL CALCULATIONS ARE PERFORMED USING THE FINITE ELEMENT LIMIT ANALYSIS CODE OXLIM, WHICH USES ADAPTIVE MESH REFINEMENT TO COMPUTE TIGHTLY BRACKETED LOWER AND UPPER BOUND PLASTICITY SOLUTIONS. THE VELOCITY FIELDS FROM THE UPPER BOUND ANALYSES PROVIDE THE CORRESPONDING FAILURE MECHANISMS. THE PAPER INITIALLY FOCUSES ON PURELY VERTICAL LOADING (PENETRATION AND UPLIFT), AND THEN ADDRESSES COMBINED VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL LOADING.

THE CONCEPT COMBINES THE ADVANTAGE OF SUCTION CAISSONS (KNOWN PENETRATION DEPTH AND LOCATION) AND DRAG EMBEDDED PLATE ANCHORS (EFFICIENCY AND LOW COST). THE MAIN ISSUE ASSOCIATED WITH SEPLAS RELATES TO THE KEYING PROCESS, AS THE ANCHOR IS FIRST LOADED, AND THE ASSOCIATED LOSS OF EMBEDMENT AND REDUCTION IN CAPACITY. THE PAPER PRESENTS A PLASTICITY MODEL DEVELOPED TO PREDICT THE TRAJECTORY AND LOAD DEVELOPMENT DURING ANCHOR KEYING, AND UP TO PEAK LOAD. RIGID PLASTICITY IS ASSUMED, ALLOWING THE KINEMATICS OF THE ANCHOR TO BE DETERMINED FROM A YIELD SURFACE AND ASSOCIATED PLASTIC POTENTIAL. THE TRAJECTORY AND PERFORMANCE OF A TYPICAL SEPLA ARE PREDICTED USING THE MODEL, AND ARE COMPARED WITH RESULTS FROM CENTRIFUGE TESTS AND LARGE DEFORMATION FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS. THE ANCHOR LOSS OF EMBEDMENT RANGED FROM, ~0.2 TO 1.5 TIMES THE ANCHOR HEIGHT FOR LOADING INCLINATIONS BETWEEN 408 AND 908 FROM THE HORIZONTAL. THE MODEL WAS USED FURTHER TO CALCULATE THE ANCHOR LOSS OF EMBEDMENT AND CAPACITY FOR VARYING PADEYE OFFSETS. RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE LOSS OF EMBEDMENT COULD BE REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY BY INCREASING THE OFFSET, BUT AT THE DETRIMENT OF THE ULTIMATE ANCHOR CAPACITY.

EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN THAT THE AXIAL RESISTANCE, EXPRESSED AS A PROPORTION OF THE SUBMERGED PIPELINE WEIGHT, CAN VARY BY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE, DEPENDING ON THE RATE OF AXIAL MOVEMENT AND CUMULATIVE TIME. THIS PAPER PROVIDES A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING THE MAGNITUDE OF AXIAL FRICTION. THE FRAMEWORK IS DEVELOPED WITHIN A CRITICAL STATE CONTEXT USING EFFECTIVE STRESSES, APPLICABLE TO ANY DEGREE OF DRAINAGE IN THE SOIL, QUANTIFYING THE MAGNITUDE AND DURATION OF EXCESS PORE PRESSURES GENERATED NEAR THE PIPE/SOIL INTERFACE. TWO OTHER ASPECTS OF BEHAVIOUR ARE ADDED TO MATCH THE OBSERVED VELOCITY DEPENDENCE OF AXIAL RESISTANCE: (A) A DAMAGE TERM, LEADING TO CONTRACTIVE VOLUMETRIC STRAIN AT THE INTERFACE; AND (B) STRAIN RATE DEPENDENCE OF THE MOBILISED SOIL STRENGTH. ANALYTICAL EXPRESSIONS ARE DERIVED THAT CAPTURE THE ABOVE FEATURES OF THE RESPONSE. THE RESULTING VARIATIONS OF NORMALISED FRICTIONAL RESISTANCE WITH TIME AND VELOCITY ARE THEN SHOWN TO MATCH EXPERIMENTAL DATA FROM INTERFACE SHEAR BOX TESTS, REPRESENTING A PLANAR IDEALISATION OF THE SAME BEHAVIOUR, AND FROM MODEL PIPE TESTS.

RECENT RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT GRILLAGES CAN BE DESIGNED TO HAVE SIMILAR VERTICAL BEARING CAPACITY TO A MUDMAT WITH THE SAME FOOTPRINT. THIS IS EXTENDED HEREIN BY: (A) DETERMINING GRILLAGE PERFORMANCE UNDER HORIZONTAL LOADING AT CONSTANT VERTICAL LOAD (V H); (B) THE APPLICATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF EXISTING PLASTICITY BASED MODELS FOR PREDICTING PERFORMANCE; (C) COMPARING THE V H BEHAVIOUR WITH SURFACE MUDMATS; AND (D) DISCUSSING THE IMPLICATIONS FOR DESIGN. EXPERIMENTAL TESTS WERE CONDUCTED IN SANDS OVER A RANGE OF DENSITIES AND IN TWO DIFFERENT MODES, REPRESENTING DIFFERENT INSTALLATION PROCEDURES. IN OVER PENETRATED TESTS, THE FOUNDATIONS WERE INSTALLED TO ACHIEVE A VERTICAL BEARING CAPACITY V0, FOLLOWED BY HORIZONTAL LOADING AT A CONSTANT VERTICAL LOAD WITH V &LT; V0: IN NORMALLY PENETRATED TESTS, FOUNDATIONS WERE INSTALLED TO V0 BEFORE HORIZONTAL LOADING AT CONSTANT VERTICAL LOAD WITH VV0: BOTH NORMALISED V H YIELD SURFACES AND A PLASTICITY BASED SIMULATION MODEL ARE PRESENTED FOR USE IN DESIGN. LABORATORY SCALE GRILLAGES OFFER IMPROVED HORIZONTAL CAPACITY IN LOOSE AND MEDIUM DENSE SANDS AND SIMILAR HORIZONTAL CAPACITY IN VERY DENSE SAND, COMPARED WITH SURFACE MUDMATS.

IN THE PRESENT STUDY, CENTRIFUGE MODEL TESTS WERE CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF SPUDCAN MOVEMENTS ON THE LATERAL AND AXIAL BEHAVIOUR OF ADJACENT FIXED HEAD PILES EMBEDDED IN SOFT CLAY. PARAMETERS SUCH AS JACK UP OPERATION PERIOD, CLEARANCE BETWEEN THE SPUDCAN AND PILE, AND THE EMBEDMENT LENGTH OF THE PILE ARE EXAMINED. THE TEST RESULTS SHOW THAT THE MOST CRITICAL PERIOD FOR PLATFORM PILES IS AT THE END OF SPUDCAN INSTALLATION, AND THE LATERAL PILE BEHAVIOUR IS MORE SEVERELY AFFECTED THAN THE AXIAL PILE BEHAVIOUR. DURING SPUDCAN INSTALLATION, THE INDUCED BENDING MOMENT ON A PILE LOCATED ONE QUARTER SPUDCAN DIAMETER AWAY FROM THE SPUDCAN EDGE IS ABOUT 2.4 TIMES THAT OF A PILE LOCATED ONE SPUDCAN DIAMETER AWAY. FOR A DEEPLY BURIED SPUDCAN WITH PENETRATION OF OVER THREEQUARTERS SPUDCAN DIAMETER, THE INDUCED BENDING MOMENT ON LONGER PILES IS MUCH SMALLER THAN THAT ON SHORTER PILES. THE EXPERIMENTAL FINDINGS PROVIDE FURTHER INSIGHTS INTO THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS GOVERNING SPUDCAN PILE INTERACTION IN SOFT CLAY UNDER VARIOUS CONFIGURATIONS AND CONDITIONS.

PIPELINE DESIGN ISSUES SUCH AS HYDRODYNAMIC STABILITY, LATERAL BUCKLING AND AXIAL WALKING REQUIRE ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF THE PIPE EMBEDMENT, IN ORDER TO ASSESS CORRECTLY THE PIPE SOIL RESISTANCE FORCES AND THE THERMAL INSULATION PROVIDED BY THE SOIL. THIS STUDY PRESENTS A DETAILED BACK ANALYSIS OF THE LAYING PROCESS AND THE AS LAID CONDITION OF A PIPELINE ON CARBONATE SEDIMENTS. THE PIPE EMBEDMENT IS LINKED TO THE RELEVANT SOIL PROPERTIES, METOCEAN CONDITIONS, VESSEL MOTIONS, AND LAY GEOMETRY ALONG THE ROUTE. A CYCLE BYCYCLE FRAMEWORK IS PROPOSED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EMBEDMENT AS THE PIPE IS SUBJECTED TO OSCILLATIONS DURING LAYING. THE CALCULATIONS USE PARAMETERS OBTAINED FROM STANDARD IN SITU TESTS, AND ARE APPLIED ACROSS A RANGE OF SOIL AND LAY CONDITIONS ALONG THIS PARTICULAR PIPELINE ROUTE.

TO INVESTIGATE THIS BEHAVIOUR, A LARGE DEFORMATION FINITE ELEMENT (LDFE) ANALYSIS METHOD INVOLVING FREQUENT REMESHING WAS EMPLOYED. THE LDFE METHOD ALLOWS THE CHANGING GEOMETRY OF THE SEABED WHEN DISTURBED BY THE PIPELINE TO BE INCORPORATED. ALSO, THE EFFECTS OF STRAIN RATE AND STRAIN SOFTENING ON THE UNDRAINED SHEAR STRENGTH OF THE SOIL WERE ACCOUNTED FOR. A BACK ANALYSIS OF A CENTRIFUGE MODELLING SIMULATION WAS FIRST PERFORMED, FOR VALIDATION, AND THEN A PARAMETRIC STUDY VARYING THE PIPE WEIGHT AND INITIAL EMBEDMENT WAS UNDERTAKEN. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT A STEADY STATE IS GENERALLY REACHED AT LARGE DISPLACEMENTS, REFLECTING A BALANCE BETWEEN THE GROWTH OF A SOIL BERM AHEAD OF THE PIPE AND THE SOFTENING OF THE DISTURBED SOIL. THE INITIAL BREAKOUT RESPONSE MATCHED WELL WITH PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED FAILURE ENVELOPES, AND A NEW INTERPRETATION HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO CAPTURE THE LARGE DISPLACEMENT RESPONSE. THE EFFECTIVE EMBEDMENT CONCEPT IS USED TO RATIONALISE THE INFLUENCE OF THE SOIL BERM AHEAD OF THE PIPE. THIS LEADS TO SIMPLE NEW RELATIONSHIPS FOR PREDICTING THE STEADY STATE RESIDUAL LATERAL RESISTANCE, WHICH PROVIDE MORE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF THE LDFE RESPONSE THAN PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED SOLUTIONS. THE COMPLETE LOAD DISPLACEMENT RESPONSE OVER LARGE MOVEMENTS WAS ALSO SHOWN TO BE WELL FITTED BY AN EXPONENTIAL RELATIONSHIP, ALBEIT FOR THE SPECIFIC CASE OF LATERAL MOVEMENTS UNDER CONSTANT VERTICAL LOAD.

THIS KIND OF MATERIAL IS BEING CONSIDERED IN THE DESIGN OF ENGINEERED BARRIERS FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL, BECAUSE OF ITS SEALING AND RETENTION PROPERTIES. FROM A GEOTECHNICAL POINT OF VIEW, MOST OF THE ANALYSES REQUIRED TO CHECK THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BARRIER ARE SENSITIVE TO THE VALUE CONSIDERED FOR THE WATER DENSITY. THIS IS THE CASE FOR THE UNSATURATED FLOW CALCULATIONS, WHICH DEPEND ON THE WATER RETENTION PROPERTIES OF THE SOIL. THIS PAPER PRESENTS, FIRST, A REVIEW OF MEASUREMENTS PERFORMED AT MICROSCOPIC LEVEL. A DESCRIPTION OF THE HYDRATION PROCESS OF EXPANSIVE CLAY CONSIDERING THE MICRO AND MACROSTRUCTURE IS INCLUDED. THEN A METHOD TO OBTAIN AN AVERAGE WATER DENSITY AS A FUNCTION OF SUCTION FOR SODIUM AND CALCIUM BENTONITES IS PROPOSED.

FOR NON CONDUCTING PARTICLES, ELECTRICAL RESISTIVITY MEASUREMENTS IN POROUS MEDIA ACTUALLY MEASURE THE RESISTIVITY OF THE PORE WATER, CHANGES OF WHICH ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO POROSITY CHANGE. THE SENSOR HAS BEEN INTEGRATED IN A MEASUREMENT PROBE AND A MODEL PILE TO MEASURE DENSITY CHANGES CONTINUOUSLY DURING PENETRATION. THIS FIRST IMPLEMENTATION USED IN THE GEOTECHNICAL CENTRIFUGE SHOWS THE FEASIBILITY OF THE METHOD, ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL RESULTS ALSO SHOW SOME SYSTEMATIC ERRORS RESULTING FROM THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROBE AND THE MEASUREMENT METHOD ITSELF.

HOWEVER, IN CASES WHERE SETTLEMENT TIME DATA ARE A RESULT OF A NON UNIFORM INITIAL PORE PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION, THESE CURVE FITTING PROCEDURES ARE NO LONGER VALID. IN THIS TECHNICAL NOTE, A GENERALISED PROCEDURE FOR TAYLOR AND CASAGRANDES POPULAR CURVE FITTING PROCEDURES IS PROPOSED, WHERE THE USER IS DIRECTED TO SELECT APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENT FACTORS, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF NON UNIFORM INITIAL EXCESS PORE PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION ENCOUNTERED. THESE FACTORS WERE DETERMINED BY APPROXIMATING SEPARATE REGIONS OF THE U T CURVES USING SIMPLE POWER AND EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS. IN NON UNIFORM CASES WHERE THE POWER APPROXIMATION ONLY CAPTURES A SMALL PORTION OF THE U T CURVE IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO USE THE CORRESPONDING MODIFIED CURVEFITTING PROCEDURE OBJECTIVELY.

THEY ARE USEFUL INDEX TESTS TO EXAMINE THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF A GIVEN SAND TO PARTICLE BREAKAGE; THEY PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR CALIBRATION OF PARTICULATE DISCRETE ELEMENT MODELS THAT CAPTURE CRUSHING; AND THEY CAN GIVE INFORMATION ON SIZE STRENGTH RELATIONSHIPS. THE TEST IS CONCEPTUALLY SIMPLE, BUT THE RESPONSE OF AN IRREGULAR PARTICLE IN THESE COMPRESSION TESTS IS NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD. DURING COMPRESSION THE PARTICLE CAN ROTATE. BOTH HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL FORCES ARE INDUCED AT THE PARTICLE PLATEN CONTACTS, AND SO THERE MAY BE FRICTIONAL SLIDING AT THE CONTACT POINTS AT THE SAME TIME AS, OR PRIOR TO, COMPRESSION OF THE BULK PARTICLE. ASPERITIES CAN YIELD, CHANGING THE PARTICLE GEOMETRY. THE VARIATION IN THE RESPONSE MECHANISM DURING COMPRESSION LEADS TO A LOAD DEFORMATION RESPONSE THAT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO INTERPRET. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES TWO RELATIVELY SIMPLE ANALYTICAL STUDIES OF AN IRREGULAR PARTICLE IN A PARTICLE COMPRESSION TEST. THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF THE PARTICLE TO ROTATION UNDER THE APPLIED COMPRESSIVE FORCE IS SHOWN TO DEPEND ON THE PARTICLE GEOMETRY AND THE PARTICLE PLATEN FRICTION. THE ROTATION OF THE PARTICLE IS SHOWN TO INDUCE A KINEMATIC DEGRADATION OR REDUCTION IN THE EFFECTIVE STIFFNESS OF THE SYSTEM, AND THE SYSTEM STIFFNESS DEPENDS ON THE PARTICLE SIZE. FRICTIONAL SLIDING AT THE CONTACT POINTS WILL ALSO CAUSE A REDUCTION IN STIFFNESS. THESE OBSERVATIONS MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS NOT ONLY FOR THE TEST ITSELF, BUT ALSO FOR THE RESPONSE OF IRREGULAR PARTICLES PARTICIPATING IN THE STRONG FORCE CHAINS IN STRESSED GRANULAR MATERIALS.

THIS APPROACH IS BASED ON AN INCREMENTAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEGREE OF SATURATION AND THE INITIAL VOID RATIO, WHICH SATISFIES THE INTRINSIC CONSTRAINTS FOR THREE PHASE POROUS MATERIALS. THE INCREMENTAL RELATIONSHIP CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO EXISTING SWCC EQUATIONS TO MODEL THE WATER RETENTION BEHAVIOUR FOR DEFORMABLE SOILS. ONLY ONE ADDITIONAL PARAMETER IS INTRODUCED, WHICH CAN BE CONVENIENTLY CALIBRATED BY WAY OF CONVENTIONAL WATER RETENTION TESTS. THE SWCCS FOR THE SAME SOIL AT DIFFERENT INITIAL VOID RATIOS CAN BE FOUND USING THE PROPOSED APPROACH. THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS VALIDATED AGAINST EXPERIMENTAL DATA FROM DRYING TESTS FOR BOTH COMPACTED AND RECONSTITUTED SOILS.

THE INSTALLATION OF THEIR LARGE, INVERTED, CONICAL SPUDCAN FOOTINGS INTO FINE GRAINED SILT MATERIAL IS CONSIDERED PROBLEMATIC BY AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS USUALLY DEFINED THE CONDITIONS OF INSTALLATION AS EITHER UNDRAINED IN CLAYS OR DRAINED IN SANDS. THIS IS REFLECTED IN CURRENT SNAME INDUSTRY GUIDELINES. LITTLE GUIDANCE IS PROVIDED FOR CALCULATING THE PENETRATION RESISTANCE OF SPUDCANS IN PARTIALLY DRAINED CONDITIONS. THE USE OF FULL FLOW ROUND PENETROMETERS MAY PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DIRECTLY CORRELATE SPUDCAN PREDICTIONS WITH IN SITU MEASUREMENTS. PREVIOUS CENTRIFUGE TESTING OF T BARS AND SPUDCANS HAS SHOWN A SIMILAR BEARING PRESSURE FOR INSTALLATION UNDER UNDRAINED CONDITIONS IN KAOLIN CLAY. HOWEVER, TO PROVIDE CORRELATION BETWEEN A PENETRATING SPUDCAN AND PENETROMETERS IN SOILS DISPLAYING PARTIALLY DRAINED CONDITIONS, RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SIZE, SHAPE AND PENETRATION RATE ARE REQUIRED. THIS TECHNICAL NOTE PROVIDES AN EXPERIMENTAL COMPARISON OF THE IN FLIGHT INSTALLATION OF A T BAR PENETROMETER AND A TYPICALLY SHAPED SPUDCAN FOOTING IN RECONSTITUTED CALCAREOUS SILT. THE EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED AT AN ACCELERATION OF 100 TIMES THAT OF EARTHS GRAVITY (KNOWN AS 100G) IN THE DRUM CENTRIFUGE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA.

COUPLED CONSOLIDATION FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSES, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR LARGE DEFORMATION AND FINITE SLIDING EFFECTS, WERE CARRIED OUT USING ABAQUS/STANDARD V6.6 AT VARIOUS RATES OF CONE PENETRATION. THE MODEL ASSUMED A SMOOTH SOIL/CONE INTERFACE, WITH THE SOIL IDEALISED AS A HOMOGENEOUS ELASTIC PERFECTLY PLASTIC MATERIAL OBEYING A NONDILATANT DRUCKER PRAGER YIELD CRITERION. THE RESULTS FOR THE LIMITING UNDRAINED AND DRAINED CONDITIONS ARE COMPARED WITH PUBLISHED STRAIN PATH AND CONE FACTOR SOLUTIONS. THE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCE OF THIS WORK IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE THEORETICAL BACKBONE CURVES ARISING FROM THE EFFECTS OF PARTIAL CONSOLIDATION DURING CONE PENETRATION. THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE BACKBONE CURVES ARE EXAMINED, AND A SIMPLIFIED PROCEDURE FOR DERIVING THESE CURVES IS PROPOSED USING A HYPERBOLIC FIT. AN EXAMPLE IS THEN PRESENTED TO ILLUSTRATE HOW THE DATA FROM MEASURED FIELD CONE TESTS PERFORMED AT DIFFERENT PENETRATION RATES MAY BE USED TO ESTIMATE THE STRENGTH, DEFORMATION AND CONSOLIDATION CHARACTERISTICS OF A SOIL.

HOWEVER, ITS APPLICATION IN QUANTIFYING SOIL HYDRAULIC PARAMETERS HAS BEEN LIMITED. IN THIS STUDY, EXPERIMENTS OF WATER INFLOW IN UNSATURATED SOIL SAMPLES WERE CONDUCTED IN AN OEDOMETER EQUIPPED TO PERFORM THREE DIMENSIONAL ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS. RECONSTRUCTIONS OF THE ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY AT DIFFERENT TIMES CONFIRMED THE USEFULNESS OF ERT FOR MONITORING THE EVOLUTION OF WATER CONTENT. THE TOMOGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTIONS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A FINITE ELEMENT SIMULATION TO INFER THE WATER RETENTION CURVE AND THE UNSATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY. THE PARAMETERS ESTIMATED WITH ERT AGREE SATISFACTORILY WITH THOSE DETERMINED USING ESTABLISHED TECHNIQUES, HENCE THE PROPOSED APPROACH SHOWS GOOD POTENTIAL FOR RELATIVELY FAST CHARACTERISATIONS. SIMILAR EXPERIMENTS COULD BE CARRIED OUT ON SITE TO STUDY THE HYDRAULIC BEHAVIOUR OF THE ENTIRE SOIL DEPOSIT.

ELLISON K.C., SOGA K., SIMPSON B.	A STRAIN SPACE SOIL MODEL WITH EVOLVING STIFFNESS ANISOTROPY	2012	GEOTECHNIQUE	62	7		627	641		1	HTTP://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URL?EID2 S2.0 84856305519&PARTNERID40&MD5710A433BCD29EC45EC1341FC3F915E8F	CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, CAMBRIDGE, UNITED KINGDOM; ARUP GEOTECHNICS, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM	ELLISON, K.C., CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, CAMBRIDGE, UNITED KINGDOM; SOGA, K., CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, CAMBRIDGE, UNITED KINGDOM; SIMPSON, B., ARUP GEOTECHNICS, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM	A COMPLETE FORMULATION OF THE BRICK SOIL MODEL IN GENERAL STRAIN SPACE IS PRESENTED HEREIN FOR THE FIRST TIME. LIKE ALL ELASTO PLASTIC CONSTITUTIVE MODELS, BRICK EXHIBITS SOME ANISOTROPIC BEHAVIOUR, OWING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PLASTIC STRAINS ONCE ITS YIELD SURFACES ARE ENGAGED. HOWEVER, AN ABUNDANCE OF LABORATORY AND FIELD EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT STIFFNESS ANISOTROPY IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT WITHIN THE ELASTIC DOMAIN. BECAUSE OF THE INSEPARABLE NATURE OF STRENGTH AND STIFFNESS IN BRICK, THE SIMPLE USE OF AN ANISOTROPIC ELASTIC STIFFNESS MATRIX WOULD RESULT IN AN UNREALISTICALLY HIGH DEGREE OF STRENGTH ANISOTROPY. THEREFORE, IN ADDITION TO THE ESTABLISHED BRICK FORMULATION, THIS PAPER ALSO PRESENTS A NOVEL FRAMEWORK TO INTRODUCE STIFFNESS ANISOTROPY BY TRANSFORMING THE COORDINATE SYSTEM IN WHICH THE MODEL IS BASED. THE TRANSFORMED COORDINATE SYSTEM EVOLVES TO ENABLE A CONSTANT VOLUME CONDITION DURING SHEARING AT CRITICAL STATE, REFLECTING THE REORGANISATION OF THE SOIL FABRIC. THE SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE OF THE ENHANCED BRICK MODEL OVER THE CLASSIC MODEL IS DEMONSTRATED BY A VARIETY OF CONVENTIONAL AND NON CONVENTIONAL LABORATORY TESTS ON LONDON CLAY.

THE METHOD PROPOSED IN THE PAPER CONSIDERS THE INFLUENCE OF THE PILE SOIL RADIAL INTERACTION ON THE BEARING CAPACITY AND SETTLEMENT BEHAVIOUR. THE CALCULATION RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PILE SOIL RADIAL INTERACTION IS STRENGTHENED AND THE BEARING CAPACITY OF A SINGLE PILE IS INCREASED WHEN THE TAPER ANGLE OF A RIGID PILE IS INCREASED. THE RELIABILITY WAS VERIFIED BY TWO MODEL TESTS. CALCULATED RESULTS OBTAINED BY THE PROPOSED METHOD WERE COMPARED WITH THE TEST DATA. THE CLOSE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CALCULATED AND MEASURED VALUES CONFIRMED THAT THE METHOD IS REASONABLY ACCURATE FOR ANALYSING THE BEHAVIOUR OF TAPERED RIGID PILES.

WATER CONTENT WAS LOCALLY MONITORED BY MEANS OF A RESISTIVITY PROBE. THE WATER CONTENT/RESISTIVITY CALIBRATION CURVES OF AN INTACT, NATURAL, UNSATURATED LOESS FROM NORTHERN FRANCE EXTRACTED BY BLOCK SAMPLING AT TWO DEPTHS (1 AND 3.3 M) WERE CAREFULLY DETERMINED, SHOWING GOOD ACCURACY AND REPEATABILITY. THE VALIDITY OF TWO MODELS GIVING THE RESISTIVITY OF UNSATURATED SOILS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR WATER CONTENT WAS EXAMINED. THE FIRST TRIAXIAL TESTS CARRIED OUT WITH THIS DEVICE IN THE RANGE OF IN SITU STRESSES GAVE SATISFACTORY RESULTS, BUT WITH SOME EFFECTS OF THE APPLIED CELL STRESS ON THE WATER CONTENT MEASUREMENTS. SOME PRELIMINARY BEHAVIOUR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NATURAL UNSATURATED LOESS, A MATERIAL RARELY TESTED UP TO NOW IN THE LITERATURE, WERE EVIDENCED. ALSO, THE YIELD STRESSES APPEARED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE IN SITU STRESSES, CONFIRMING THE COMBINED EFFECT OF PARTIAL SATURATION AND BONDING.

DESIGN PARAMETERS THAT DETERMINE THE SOIL RESISTANCE TO LATERAL AND AXIAL MOTION OF THE PIPELINE ARE A FUNCTION OF THE AMOUNT OF VERTICAL EMBEDMENT. HOWEVER, THIS LATTER QUANTITY IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE, PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS OF SOIL HEAVE AROUND THE PIPELINE AS IT PENETRATES, AND PARTLY BECAUSE THE SOIL SHEAR STRENGTH DEPENDS ON THE STRAIN RATE AND THE DEGREE OF SOFTENING AS THE SOIL IS SHEARED AND REMOULDED. IN THIS PAPER, A LARGE DEFORMATION FINITE ELEMENT APPROACH WAS ADOPTED TO STUDY PIPE SOIL INTERACTION DURING VERTICAL EMBEDMENT OF PIPELINES ON THE SEABED. THE SIMPLE TRESCA SOIL MODEL WAS MODIFIED TO INCORPORATE THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF STRAIN RATE AND SOFTENING. THE PRESENT LARGE DEFORMATION FINITE ELEMENT METHOD WAS VALIDATED BY COMPARING THE RESULTS WITH DATA FROM CENTRIFUGE MODEL TESTS. A PARAMETRIC STUDY WAS THEN PERFORMED, VARYING THE STRAIN RATE AND SOFTENING PARAMETERS TO EXPLORE THEIR EFFECTS ON PENETRATION RESISTANCE. SIMPLE EXPRESSIONS FOR PENETRATION RESISTANCE, INCORPORATING THE EFFECTS OF STRAIN RATE AND SOFTENING, HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED. THE EFFECTS OF SOIL STRENGTH VERTICAL HETEROGENEITY AND BUOYANCY HAVE ALSO BEEN EXPLORED.

BASED ON EXISTING EXPERIMENTAL DATA, SOME AUTHORS DEFINE THE FUNCTION FI ASSUMING THAT ANY GIVEN LOADING SURFACE IS A LOCUS OF CONSTANT VOLUMETRIC VISCOPLASTIC STRAIN RATE. OTHERS, INSTEAD, ASSUME THAT A LOADING SURFACE IS A LOCUS OF CONSTANT FI. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE IMPLICATIONS OF USING EITHER OF THE ABOVE APPROACHES. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE TWO APPROACHES YIELD VERY SIMILAR PREDICTIONS FOR STRESS STATES FAR FROM FAILURE (FOR STRESS LEVELS UP TO APPROXIMATELY 0.6), HOWEVER, CRITICAL STATE CONDITIONS ARE REPRODUCED ONLY WHEN THE CURRENT LOADING SURFACE IS ASSUMED TO BE A LOCUS OF CONSTANT FI.

A VARIETY OF METHODS EXIST FOR THE PREDICTION OF THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY BASED ON EMPIRICAL FITS TO DATABASES OF SOIL THERMAL CONDUCTIVITIES. IN THIS PAPER AN ANALYTICAL MODEL WILL BE DEVELOPED BASED ON UNIDIRECTIONAL HEAT FLOW THROUGH A THREE PHASE SOIL ELEMENT. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS MODEL WILL BE VALIDATED AGAINST A DATABASE OF 155 TEST MEASUREMENTS FROM THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE. A VARIETY OF ALTERNATIVE PREDICTION METHODS WILL BE TESTED AGAINST THIS DATASET, WITH THE MODEL DERIVED HERE BEING SHOWN TO BE AT LEAST AS GOOD AS THE BEST EMPIRICAL MODEL WHILE RETAINING A PHYSICAL ORIGIN.

IN THE PROPOSED MODEL TWO MAIN SURFACES THE MAIN WETTING AND MAIN DRYING SURFACES ENCLOSE THE DOMAIN OF ATTAINABLE SOIL STATES IN THE DEGREE OF SATURATION SUCTION VOID RATIO SPACE. INSIDE THIS DOMAIN, THE VARIATION OF DEGREE OF SATURATION IS GOVERNED BY A REVERSIBLE SCANNING LAW, WHICH DESCRIBES THE TRANSITION FROM ONE MAIN SURFACE TO THE OTHER. A SIMPLIFIED CALIBRATION PROCEDURE IS PRESENTED TO SELECT THE VALUES OF THE FOUR PARAMETERS DEFINING THE TWO MAIN SURFACES BY USING A MINIMUM OF TWO COMPRESSION TESTS AT CONSTANT SUCTION AND ONE DRYING TEST AT CONSTANT MEAN NET STRESS. MODEL COMPUTATIONS ARE VALIDATED AGAINST RESULTS FROM AN EXPERIMENTAL CAMPAIGN ON A COMPACTED MIXTURE OF BENTONITE AND KAOLIN. THE PROPOSED FORMULATION IS CAPABLE OF CAPTURING IMPORTANT SOIL FEATURES, SUCH AS THE INFLUENCE OF HYDRAULIC HYSTERESIS AND DEFORMATION ON THE VARIATION OF DEGREE OF SATURATION, AND THE DEPENDENCE OF WATER RETENTION BEHAVIOUR DURING COMPRESSION ON PREVIOUS WETTING DRYING HISTORY. MOREOVER, DURING MAIN WETTING OR MAIN DRYING AT HIGH SUCTION (I.E. AT LOW SATURATION), THE MODEL CORRECTLY PREDICTS A VIRGIN RETENTION LINE THAT UNIQUELY RELATES WATER RATIO AND SUCTION REGARDLESS OF THE CURRENT VALUE OF VOID RATIO.

THE AIM WAS TO TEST WHETHER INNOVATIVE SENSOR TECHNOLOGY COULD DETECT INCIPIENT FAILURE IN TIME. HOWEVER, THE DATA GENERATED ALSO MADE IT POSSIBLE TO CONDUCT A GEOTECHNICAL ASSESSMENT OF STABILITY. THE PAPER DISCUSSES THE RELATION BETWEEN THE PARAMETERS DERIVED FROM LABORATORY TESTS, FIELD MEASUREMENTS AND BEHAVIOUR OBSERVED IN THE FIELD. PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN THE STANDARD TRIAXIAL TESTING OF PEAT SAMPLES ARE DISCUSSED, AS THE SAMPLES TEND TO FAIL IN TENSION. A TRIAL PIT THROUGH THE FAILED EMBANKMENT SHOWED THAT THERE WERE WIDE TENSION CRACKS IN THE PEAT LAYER, INDICATING THAT THE PEAT LAYER FAILED IN TENSION, AT LEAST LOCALLY. HOWEVER, HORIZONTAL MOVEMENT DOMINATES THE OVERALL FAILURE MECHANISM. AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO TRIAXIAL TESTING, DIRECT SIMPLE SHEAR (DSS) TESTING FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF PEAT PARAMETERS IS CONSIDERED. THE RESULTS OF THE DSS TESTS CORRESPOND WELL WITH FIELD MEASUREMENTS AND THE BACK ANALYSIS OF THE FAILURE.

IT IS SHOWN THAT DEPTH AND FREQUENCY DEPENDENT WINKLER SPRINGS AND DASHPOTS, OBTAINED BY DIVIDING THE COMPLEX VALUED SIDE FRICTION AND THE CORRESPONDING DISPLACEMENTS ALONG THE PILE, MAY FAITHFULLY DESCRIBE THE INTERACTION EFFECT, CONTRARY TO THE COMMON PERCEPTION THAT THE WINKLER CONCEPT IS ALWAYS APPROXIMATE. AN AXISYMMETRIC WAVE SOLUTION, BASED ON LINEAR ELASTODYNAMIC THEORY, IS THEN DERIVED FOR THE HARMONIC STEADY STATE RESPONSE OF FINITE AND INFINITELY LONG PILES IN A HOMOGENEOUS VISCOELASTIC SOIL STRATUM, WITH THE FORMER TYPE OF PILE RESTING ON RIGID ROCK. THE PILE IS MODELLED AS A CONTINUUM, WITHOUT THE RESTRICTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH STRENGTH OF MATERIALS APPROXIMATIONS. CLOSED FORM SOLUTIONS ARE OBTAINED FOR: (A) THE DISPLACEMENT FIELD IN THE SOIL AND THE PILE; (B) THE STIFFNESS AND DAMPING (IMPEDANCE) COEFFICIENTS AT THE PILE HEAD; (C) THE ACTUAL, DEPTH DEPENDENT, DYNAMIC WINKLER MODULI; AND (D) A SET OF FICTITIOUS, DEPTH INDEPENDENT WINKLER MODULI TO MATCH THE DYNAMIC RESPONSE AT THE PILE HEAD. RESULTS ARE PRESENTED IN TERMS OF DIMENSIONLESS GRAPHS, TABLES AND SIMPLE EQUATIONS THAT PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE COMPLEX PHYSICS OF THE PROBLEM. THE PREDICTIONS OF THE MODEL COMPARE FAVOURABLY WITH EXISTING SOLUTIONS, WHILE NEW RESULTS AND SIMPLE DESIGN ORIENTED FORMULAE ARE PRESENTED.

THIS OPENS THE WAY FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF HYPOPLASTIC MODELS. TO DEMONSTRATE THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH, A HYPOPLASTIC EQUIVALENT OF THE MODIFIED CAM CLAY MODEL IS DEVELOPED. A COMPARISON OF THE PREDICTIONS OF THE ELASTO PLASTIC AND HYPOPLASTIC MODELS REVEALS THE MERITS OF THE HYPOPLASTIC FORMULATION. ALTHOUGH BOTH MODELS PREDICT THE SAME ASYMPTOTIC STATES, HYPOPLASTICITY PREDICTS A SMOOTH TRANSITION BETWEEN OVERCONSOLIDATED AND NORMALLY CONSOLIDATED STATES, AND THUS ACCOUNTS FOR THE NON LINEARITY OF THE SOIL BEHAVIOUR INSIDE THE STATE BOUNDARY SURFACE IN A NATURAL MANNER.

WHILE SUCH PILES HAVE BEEN USED FOR AROUND 25 YEARS WITH NO APPARENT DETRIMENTAL EFFECT, THERE IS LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR THERMO MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR. THIS PAPER SYNTHESISES THE RESULTS FROM THREE PUBLISHED FIELD STUDIES AND ILLUSTRATES SOME OF THE ENGINEERING BEHAVIOUR OF SUCH PILES DURING HEATING AND COOLING. SIMPLIFIED LOAD TRANSFER MECHANISMS FOR A SINGLE PILE SUBJECTED TO PURE THERMAL LOADINGS (I.E. WITHOUT MECHANICAL LOAD) AND COMBINED THERMOMECHANICAL LOADINGS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND ARE USED TO INTERPRET THE FIELD DATA WITH REGARD TO CHANGE IN AXIAL STRESS AND SHAFT FRICTION DURING HEATING AND COOLING. THE EFFECT OF END RESTRAINT AND GROUND CONDITIONS ON THE THERMO MECHANICAL RESPONSE OF ENERGY PILES IS DISCUSSED. VALUES OF CHANGE IN AXIAL STRESS AND MOBILISED SHAFT FRICTION DUE TO THERMAL EFFECTS THAT MAY BE USEFUL IN THE DESIGN OF ENERGY PILES ARE PRESENTED.

THE CRITERION IS BASED ON BIFURCATION THEORY AND APPLIED TO ELASTO PLASTICITY BY ALLOWING MULTIPLE INCREMENTAL SOLUTIONS IN ELASTO PLASTIC SOILS, PHYSICALLY LOSING CONTROLLABILITY OF STRESS BOUNDARY CONDITIONS. DRAINED DIFFUSE INSTABILITIES ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD, AND ARE INDUCED BY KINEMATIC MODES DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OBSERVED IN SHEAR BANDS AND LIQUEFACTION INSTABILITIES. UNLIKE SHEAR BANDS, DIFFUSE INSTABILITIES OCCUR UNDER FAIRLY HOMOGENOUS DEFORMATION MODES AND, UNLIKE LIQUEFACTION, DRAINED INSTABILITIES ARE NOT GENERATED BY THE EXCESS PORE PRESSURES. RECENT EXPERIMENTS UNDER DRAINED CONSTANT SHEAR REPORT SUDDEN HOMOGENEOUS INSTABILITIES IN SAMPLES OF RELATIVELY DENSE AND LOOSE SANDS. THE CRITERION PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN ELASTO PLASTICITY MODEL FOR SANDS TO PREDICT AND EXPLAIN THESE REPORTED DRAINED INSTABILITIES. FROM A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT, THESE DEVELOPMENTS SERVE TO EXPAND THE REPERTOIRE OF POTENTIAL INSTABILITIES THAT OCCUR WELL BEFORE FAILURE, AND WHICH HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN CASE STUDIES OF PUZZLING SLOPE INSTABILITY FAILURES UNDER FULLY DRAINED CONDITIONS.

DEVELOPMENT IN TIME OF BOTH THE LANDSLIDE DISPLACEMENTS AND THE EARTH PRESSURE ACTING ON THE RETAINING STRUCTURE IS OBTAINED IN THE CLOSED FORM, WITH THE LATTER GIVEN BY THE CLASSICAL TERZAGHI EXPRESSION FOR THE AVERAGE DEGREE OF CONSOLIDATION. DEPENDING ON THE VALUE OF THE LONG TERM SAFETY FACTOR, THE LANDSLIDE EITHER EVENTUALLY SLOWS DOWN, ASYMPTOTICALLY APPROACHING FINAL DISPLACEMENTS, OR THE SOIL BEHIND THE RETAINING WALL COMES TO A PASSIVE FAILURE, FOLLOWED BY A POST FAILURE EVOLUTION OF THE LANDSLIDE. THE MODEL IS CAPABLE OF QUANTIFYING BOTH SCENARIOS, WITH SOME OF ITS FEATURES SUCCESSFULLY VALIDATED AGAINST THE MONITORING AND GEOTECHNICAL DATA FROM THE TWO CASE STUDIES: THE COMBE CHOPIN AND GANTER LANDSLIDES IN SWITZERLAND. FOR THE COMBE CHOPIN LANDSLIDE, WHICH CAME TO A STANDSTILL, THE MODEL HAS DEMONSTRATED ITS ABILITY TO PREDICT FINAL DOWNHILL DISPLACEMENTS AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT IN TIME. FOR THE GANTER LANDSLIDE, WHICH FAILED AND ACHIEVED STEADY STATE VELOCITY, THE MODEL CORRECTLY PREDICTED THE LONG TERM LANDSLIDE EVOLUTION AND THE EFFECTS OF DRAINAGE AND EROSION ON THE DISPLACEMENT RATES.

OWING TO SOIL CONSOLIDATION DURING THE JACK UP OPERATIONAL PERIOD AND THE INTERVENING PERIOD BEFORE REINSTALLATION, THE INTERACTION BETWEEN A NEW SPUDCAN INSTALLATION AND AN EXISTING FOOTPRINT IS COMPLEX AND TIME DEPENDENT. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A SERIES OF DRUM CENTRIFUGE MODEL TESTS TO INVESTIGATE THE CHANGES IN THE SHEAR STRENGTH OF SOILS BENEATH AND ADJACENT TO A SPUDCAN FOOTPRINT IN NORMALLY AND OVERCONSOLIDATED CLAYS. THE CHANGES WITH TIME AFTER TWO DIFFERENT JACK UP OPERATIONAL PERIODS ARE PRESENTED. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT THE SOIL BENEATH A FOOTPRINT GENERALLY LOSES SOME STRENGTH INITIALLY, OWING TO SOIL REMOULDING, BUT IT SUBSEQUENTLY REGAINS ITS STRENGTH WITH TIME AS IT RECONSOLIDATES. THE SOIL REMOULDING AND SUBSEQUENT STRENGTH GAIN ARE FOUND TO BE MORE SIGNIFICANT IN NORMALLY CONSOLIDATED CLAY THAN IN OVERCONSOLIDATED CLAY. A LONGER JACK UP OPERATIONAL PERIOD HAS AN EFFECT OF STRENGTHENING THE UNDERLYING SOIL BELOW THE SPUDCAN IN BOTH CLAYS. THE VERTICAL LOAD, INDUCED HORIZONTAL LOAD AND MOMENT ON A SPUDCAN DURING ITS REINSTALLATION INTO AN EXISTING FOOTPRINT AT DIFFERENT TIMES AFTER FOOTPRINT FORMATION ARE STUDIED. COMPARED WITH THE LOAD FOR INSTALLING A SPUDCAN FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE LOAD REQUIRED TO REINSTALL THE SAME SPUDCAN TO THE SAME DEPTH IS SMALLER IN NORMALLY CONSOLIDATED CLAY IF THE ELAPSED TIME BETWEEN FOOTPRINT FORMATION AND SPUDCAN REINSTALLATION IS RELATIVELY SHORT. THE REQUIRED LOAD FOR SPUDCAN REINSTALLATION SUBSEQUENTLY INCREASES WITH FOOTPRINT ELAPSED TIME. FOR OVERCONSOLIDATED CLAY, THE LOAD REQUIRED FOR SPUDCAN REINSTALLATION IS ALWAYS SMALLER THAN THAT FOR INITIAL SPUDCAN INSTALLATION, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE TIME BETWEEN INSTALLATIONS. THE EFFECTS OF ORIGINAL IN SITU SOIL STRENGTH, CHANGES IN SOIL STRENGTH WITH TIME AND FOOTPRINT ELAPSED TIME ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN SPUDCAN AND FOOTPRINT ARE EXAMINED.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS AND ANALYSES SIX YEARS OF FIELD MEASUREMENTS OF SOIL WATER CONTENT AND PORE WATER PRESSURES IN THE UPPER LAYERS OF A LIGHTLY VEGETATED LONDON CLAY SLOPE NEAR NEWBURY, UK, AND SHOWS HOW THEY CAN BE RELATED QUANTITATIVELY TO THE CLIMATE USING A WATER BALANCE MODEL. THE FIELD OBSERVATIONS ARE SET IN THE CONTEXT OF A 40 YEAR RUN OF RAINFALL DATA FOR THE SITE. MODERATELY EXTREME RAINFALL AND DROUGHT EVENTS WERE EXPERIENCED OVER THE PERIOD 2003 2008, ALLOWING ALMOST THE FULL VARIATION IN LIKELY PORE WATER PRESSURES TO BE CHARACTERISED. PORE WATER PRESSURES WERE FOUND TO RETURN TO NEAR HYDROSTATIC DURING MOST WINTERS. VARIATIONS IN SUMMER RAINFALL, PARTICULARLY DURING JUNE AUGUST, ARE SHOWN TO HAVE A LARGE INFLUENCE ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CYCLES OF PORE WATER PRESSURE AND EFFECTIVE STRESS. THE 40 YEAR RAINFALL DATASET IS USED TO CALCULATE APPROXIMATE RETURN PERIODS FOR THE OBSERVED SOIL CONDITIONS, AND PROVIDES A BENCHMARK FOR CALCULATING THE IMPACTS OF EXPECTED CLIMATE CHANGE ON SIMILAR SITES.

BY ASSUMING SMALL STRAIN DEFORMATION IN THE ELASTIC REGION AND LARGESTRAIN DEFORMATION IN THE PLASTIC REGION, THE FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM IS REDUCED TO SOLVING A SYSTEM OF FIRSTORDER ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS FOR THE RADIAL, TANGENTIAL AND VERTICAL EFFECTIVE STRESSES IN THE PLASTIC ZONE. THE PORE PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION CAN SUBSEQUENTLY BE DETERMINED FROM THE RADIAL EQUILIBRIUM EQUATION IN TERMS OF THE TOTAL STRESSES. THE SEMI ANALYTICAL SOLUTION DERIVED IN THIS PAPER FOLLOWS THE RIGOROUS DEFINITIONS FOR THE TWO EFFECTIVE STRESS INVARIANTS INSTEAD OF APPROXIMATE ONES, AS USUALLY ASSUMED IN THE EXISTING LITERATURE, AND APPLIES TO THE MORE GENERAL CASE WHERE THE OUT OF PLANE (VERTICAL) IN SITU STRESS MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THE IN PLANE (HORIZONTAL) ONE. THE RESULTS SHOW CLEARLY THAT THE STRESS HISTORY (OVERCONSOLIDATION RATIO) HAS A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE STRESS AND PORE PRESSURE DISTRIBUTIONS AROUND THE CAVITY. THE PRESENT SOLUTION PROVIDES AN EXACT AND REALISTIC THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR PREDICTING THE SOIL BEHAVIOUR AROUND THE CYLINDRICAL CAVITY, WITH APPLICATIONS TO THE INTERPRETATION OF PRESSUREMETER TESTS AND TO PILE INSTALLATION PROBLEMS. IT ALSO SERVES AS A VALUABLE BENCHMARK FOR VERIFYING VARIOUS CAVITY EXPANSION NUMERICAL METHODS INVOLVING THE CRITICAL STATE PLASTICITY MODEL.

THE RESULTS OF A SERIES OF PLANE STRAIN CENTRIFUGE TESTS PERFORMED ON TUNNELS IN A DRY SILICA SAND ARE EXAMINED. THE COVER TO DIAMETER RATIO, C/D, OF THE TUNNELS RANGED FROM 1.3 TO 4.4. FEATURES OF GREENFIELD SETTLEMENT TROUGH SHAPE, BOTH SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE, ARE ILLUSTRATED BY EXAMINING SOIL DISPLACEMENT DATA OBTAINED USING AN IMAGE BASED DEFORMATION MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE. THE EFFECTS OF TUNNEL SIZE, DEPTH AND VOLUME LOSS ARE DEMONSTRATED, AND THE SUITABILITY OF TYPICAL FITTING CURVES IS DISCUSSED. THE COMPLEX VOLUMETRIC BEHAVIOUR OF DRAINED SOIL IS ILLUSTRATED BY COMPARING TUNNEL VOLUME LOSS WITH THE VOLUME LOSS EXPERIENCED BY THE SOIL. A SET OF EQUATIONS IS DEVELOPED THAT PROVIDE A METHOD OF EVALUATING THE CHANGE OF SETTLEMENT TROUGH SHAPE WITH TUNNEL SIZE, DEPTH AND VOLUME LOSS.

Y., RESEARCH INSTITUTE IN CIVIL AND MECHANICAL ENGINEERING, ECOLE CENTRALE DE NANTES, UNIVERSITY OF NANTES, FRANCE	THE SHEAR STRENGTH OF COARSE GRANULAR MATERIALS, WIDELY USED IN CIVIL WORKS SUCH AS ROCKFILL IN DAM CONSTRUCTION, IS SELDOM MEASURED BECAUSE OF SEVERE PRACTICAL EXPERIMENTAL LIMITATIONS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN ORIGINAL METHOD FOR EVALUATING THE SHEAR STRENGTH OF SUCH MATERIALS, BASED ON SIZE EFFECTS IN GRANULAR MATERIALS AFFECTED BY GRAIN BREAKAGE ACCORDING TO FRACTURE MECHANICS. THROUGH A GENERAL SIZE EFFECT RELATION OPERATING ON SHEAR STRENGTH ENVELOPES, THIS METHOD MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE SHEAR STRENGTH OF A COARSE GRAINED GRANULAR MATERIAL FROM THE MEASURED PROPERTIES OF A FINERGRAINED GRANULAR MATERIAL MADE OF THE SAME MINERAL. IN THE PAPER, THE METHOD IS EXPLICITLY PROVED, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF BREAKAGE RESISTANCES OF PARTICLES WITH DIFFERENT SIZES, WITHIN MATERIALS THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED AS PHYSICALLY SIMILAR, PARTICULARLY HAVING PARALLEL GRAIN SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS AND THE SAME COMPACTNESS. A WIDE SET OF INDEPENDENT EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS IS SHOWN TO VALIDATE THE METHOD CONSISTENTLY.

EXTENSION OF THE SIMPLIFIED PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING LIQUEFACTION RESISTANCE OF FINE GRAINED SOILS HAS NOT ACHIEVED THE SAME DEGREE OF SUCCESS. IT WOULD BE IDEAL TO HAVE A UNIFIED MODEL THAT IS BASED ON IN SITU TESTING AND IS APPLICABLE TO BOTH SAND LIKE AND CLAY LIKE SOILS. THIS NOTE EXAMINES ONE SUCH MODEL AND EXTENDS ITS USE TO BOTH SAND LIKE AND CLAY LIKE SOILS. HEREIN, VERIFICATION OF THIS UNIFIED MODEL USING FIELD DATA FROM ADAPAZARI, TURKEY AFTER THE 1999 EARTHQUAKE IS DOCUMENTED ALONG WITH COMPARISONS WITH EXISTING MODELS. SATISFACTORY RESULTS ARE OBTAINED, WHICH SHOWS THAT THE PROPOSED PIEZOCONE PENETRATION TEST (CPTU) BASED MODEL IS APPLICABLE TO BOTH SAND LIKE AND CLAY LIKE SOILS.

THE DEPTH OF GRADE III WEATHERED ROCK, THE TOP OF COMPLETELY DECOMPOSED GRANITE (CDG), AND STANDARD PENETRATION TEST N VALUE OF 200 (SPT 200) ARE OFTEN USED AS INDICATORS FOR DECISION MAKING IN ARRIVING AT THE PRELIMINARY FOUNDING DEPTH OF PILES IN HONG KONG. THE WORK REPORTED IN THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON EVALUATION OF THE SPATIAL VARIABILITY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ABOVE FOUNDING DEPTH INDICATORS AT A CONSTRUCTION SITE, USING STATISTICAL MODELS BASED ON RANDOM FIELD THEORY. SPATIAL VARIABILITY CHARACTERISTICS ARE EVALUATED USING THE MEASURED DATA IN TERMS OF SCALE OF FLUCTUATION. GEOSTATISTICS IS USED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL DATA AT UNSAMPLED LOCATIONS FOR MAPPING PROFILES OF FOUNDING DEPTH INDICATORS OVER THE SITE, USING THE MEASURED DATA FROM BOREHOLE RECORDS AND SITE INVESTIGATION RESULTS. IT IS OBSERVED FROM THE RESULTS THAT, IF FAULTS ARE NOT PRESENT, THE DEPTH OF THE GRADE III SURFACE EXHIBITS THE LARGEST SCALE OF FLUCTUATION AMONG THE THREE INDICATORS, AND THE VARIABILITY OF THE GROUND IS OBSERVED TO INCREASE WITH THE WEATHERING GRADE. THE EFFECT OF THE SIZE OF THE SAMPLING DOMAIN ON THE AUTOCORRELATION CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FOUNDING DEPTH INDICATORS IS ALSO STUDIED. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SCALE OF FLUCTUATION INCREASES WITH INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE SAMPLING DOMAIN.

THE POSSIBILITY OF DETERMINING POROSITY FROM DIRECT INVERSION OF V P AND V S, WHICH ARE ROUTINELY MEASURED IN GEOPHYSICAL PROSPECTING, IS APPEALING. A METHODOLOGY HAS BEEN RECENTLY PROPOSED AND SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED TO A NUMBER OF SITES AND IT IS BASED ON THE APPARENT INSENSITIVITY OF POROSITY ON POISSON RATIO OF THE SOIL SKELETON V SK, WHICH IS A PRIORI AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY. SO FAR, HOWEVER, THE FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCE OF POROSITY ON V SK HAS ONLY MARGINALLY BEEN INVESTIGATED AND DOUBTS ARISE REGARDING WHETHER THE METHOD IS ALWAYS APPLICABLE. THIS STUDY ATTEMPTS TO INVESTIGATE THOROUGHLY THE STABILITY OF THE INVERSION OF MEASURED V S AND V P TO ESTIMATE POROSITY AND TO ASSESS THE DEGREE OF WELL POSEDNESS OF THE PROCEDURE FOR ALL THE COMBINATIONS OF V P AND V S RELEVANT IN REAL SOILS.

ARTIFICIAL SAMPLES OF SANDSTONE WERE CREATED BY ALLOWING A CEMENT TO HYDRATE WHILE A SAND SAMPLE WAS UNDER A HIGH CONFINING STRESS IN A TRIAXIAL APPARATUS. COMPARISONS WERE THEN MADE BETWEEN THE BEHAVIOUR OF SAMPLES THAT HAD BEEN UNLOADED TO ZERO CONFINING STRESS WITH THAT OF SAMPLES TESTED AT STRESS LEVELS AROUND THAT DURING CEMENTING. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE ISOTROPIC UNLOADING DAMAGED THE CEMENT, WHICH HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE SMALL STRAIN AND YIELDING BEHAVIOUR BUT NOT ON THE STRENGTH AND LARGE STRAIN BEHAVIOUR. COMPARISONS WERE ALSO MADE WITH TESTS ON NATURAL SAMPLES OF RESERVOIR AND ANALOGUE SANDSTONES, AND IT WAS FOUND THAT THE ARTIFICIAL SANDSTONE HAD REPRODUCED THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THEIR BEHAVIOUR. THE INTRINSIC PROPERTIES OF ALL OF THE SANDSTONES TESTED WERE FOUND TO BE SIMILAR, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE PEAK STRENGTHS AND GROSS YIELDING ENVELOPES. CEMENT CONTENT WAS FOUND NOT TO BE THE SOLE FACTOR THAT INFLUENCED THE PEAK AND GROSS YIELD ENVELOPES, AND SIGNIFICANT ANISOTROPY WAS ALSO REVEALED IN ONE SANDSTONE.

MANY OF THESE PROCESSES ARE CONTROLLED BY THE CAVITY VOLUMETRIC EXPANSION RATE IN PRACTICE. AS SOIL IS NOT AN ELASTIC MATERIAL, THE INJECTION PRESSURE IS A NON LINEAR FUNCTION OF THE CAVITY VOLUME, RENDERING IT VERY DIFFICULT TO PRODUCE THE APPROPRIATE TIME HISTORY OF INJECTION PRESSURE SO THAT THE CONTROLLED CAVITY VOLUMETRIC EXPANSION RATE CAN BE SIMULATED. IN THIS TECHNICAL NOTE, AN ALGORITHM TO DEVELOP THE TIME HISTORY OF INJECTION PRESSURE USING APPROPRIATE SOIL PROPERTIES TO GENERATE THE REQUIRED CAVITY VOLUMETRIC EXPANSION RATE IN CLAY IS PRESENTED. THE SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS OF A SERIES OF LABORATORY SCALE COMPACTION GROUTING EXPERIMENTS ARE PRESENTED AS AN EXAMPLE TO DEMONSTRATE THE VALIDITY OF THE APPROACH.

FOR THIS SAND IT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED THAT THE CRITICAL STATE EXISTS AND IS UNIQUE. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VOLUMETRIC STRAINS DUE TO CYCLIC LOADING AND THE CRITICAL STATE OF THIS MATERIAL UNDER MONOTONIC CONDITIONS IS EXPLORED HERE. DRAINED CYCLIC TESTS ON LOOSE SAMPLES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT, APPLYING DIFFERENT AMPLITUDES OF CYCLIC LOADING FOR SAMPLES THAT GENERALLY HAVE INITIAL STATES ON THE WET SIDE OF CRITICAL. THE TRENDS OF BEHAVIOUR ARE SUMMARISED, POINTING OUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INITIAL STATE PARAMETER, AMPLITUDE OF CYCLIC LOADING AND FINAL CHANGE IN THE STATE PARAMETER AT EQUILIBRIUM. EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE IS ALSO GIVEN TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SAND HAS A MEMORY OF THE VOLUMETRIC STRAIN THAT HAS PREVIOUSLY OCCURRED WHEN DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF CYCLIC LOADING ARE CONSECUTIVELY APPLIED AND EQUILIBRIUM HAS NOT BEEN REACHED.

FOR THIS PURPOSE, A COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE STUDY USING THREE DIMENSIONAL NON LINEAR NUMERICAL ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT FOR DIFFERENT PILE GROUP ARRANGEMENTS IN CLAYEY SOILS. THE RESPONSES OF THE PILE GROUPS WERE COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE SINGLE PILE, AND THE VARIATION OF THE DISPLACEMENT AMPLIFICATION FACTOR R A WAS THEN QUANTIFIED. THE INFLUENCE OF THE NUMBER OF PILES, THE SPACING AND THE DEFLECTION LEVEL ON THE GROUP RESPONSE IS DISCUSSED. A PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED RELATIONSHIP FOR PREDICTING THE RESPONSE OF A PILE GROUP, BASED ON ITS CONFIGURATION AND THE RESPONSE OF A SINGLE PILE, HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO ALLOW FOR SOIL SHEAR STRENGTH THAT WAS FOUND TO AFFECT THE GROUP RESPONSE. THE MODIFIED RELATIONSHIP PROVIDES A REASONABLE PREDICTION FOR VARIOUS GROUP CONFIGURATIONS IN CLAYEY SOILS.

Q., COLLEGE OF ARCHITECTURE AND CIVIL ENGINEERING, WENZHOU UNIVERSITY, CHINA; LIN, C., DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING, UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS, LAWRENCE, UNITED STATES	THE INTERCEPT OF THE LOG(1 + E) LOGSIGMA V STRAIGHT LINE IS INTRODUCED TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECT OF THE STARTING POINT ON THE COMPRESSIBILITY OF NATURAL AND RECONSTITUTED CLAYS. IT IS FOUND THAT WHEN THE EFFECTIVE STRESS EXCEEDS THE REMOULDED YIELD STRESS, THE COMPRESSION BEHAVIOUR OF RECONSTITUTED CLAYS IS CONTROLLED SOLELY BY THE WATER CONTENT AT THE REMOULDED YIELD STRESS AND THE LIQUID LIMIT. COMPARISON OF THE COMPRESSION BEHAVIOUR OF NATURAL AND RECONSTITUTED CLAYS INDICATES THAT THEIR DIFFERENCE IN COMPRESSIBILITY IS CAUSED BY SOIL STRUCTURE AND THE DIFFERENCE IN WATER CONTENT AT THE COMPRESSION STARTING POINT. THE COMPRESSION BEHAVIOUR OF NATURAL CLAYS CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO THREE REGIMES: (A) THE PRE YIELD REGIME, CHARACTERISED BY SMALL COMPRESSIBILITY, WITH SOIL STRUCTURE RESTRAINING THE DEFORMATION UP TO THE CONSOLIDATION YIELD STRESS; (B) THE TRANSITIONAL REGIME, CHARACTERISED BY A GRADUAL LOSS OF SOIL STRUCTURE WHEN THE EFFECTIVE STRESS IS BETWEEN THE CONSOLIDATION YIELD STRESS AND THE TRANSITIONAL STRESS; AND (C) THE POST TRANSITIONAL REGIME, CHARACTERISED BY THE SAME CHANGE LAW IN COMPRESSION BEHAVIOUR AS RECONSTITUTED CLAYS WHEN THE EFFECTIVE STRESS IS HIGHER THAN THE TRANSITIONAL STRESS. FOR THE INVESTIGATED CLAYS, THE TRANSITIONAL STRESS IS 1.0 3.5 TIMES THE CONSOLIDATION YIELD STRESS. THE COMPRESSION INDEX VARIES SOLELY WITH THE VOID RATIO AT AN EFFECTIVE STRESS OF 1.0 KPA FOR BOTH NATURAL CLAYS IN THE POST TRANSITIONAL REGIME AND RECONSTITUTED CLAYS WHEN THE EFFECTIVE STRESS EXCEEDS THE REMOULDED YIELD STRESS, AND WHEN COMPRESSED IN SUCH CASES THE COMPRESSION CURVES OF BOTH NATURAL CLAYS AND RECONSTITUTED CLAYS CAN BE WELL NORMALISED TO A UNIQUE LINE USING THE VOID INDEX.

IN THIS PAPER, THE INFLUENCE OF THE INTERMEDIATE PRINCIPAL STRESS THROUGH B VALUES ON THE STRESS STRAIN STRENGTH BEHAVIOUR OF A RECOMPACTED CDG SOIL IS INVESTIGATED BY USING A TRUE TRIAXIAL TEST SYSTEM WITH A NEW LOADING DEVICE. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE DEVIATOR STRESS DECREASES AS THE B VALUE INCREASES FROM 0 TO ABOUT 0.8, AND THE DEVIATOR STRESS IS THEN INCREASED SLIGHTLY FOR B0.8 AND B1.0. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SHEAR BAND APPEARS, HAVING CAUSED FAILURE FOR B VALUES IN THE RANGE 0.2 0.8.

THE MAGNITUDE OF THESE CAPILLARY FORCES DEPENDS ON THE SURFACE TENSION AND ON THE RADIUS OF CURVATURE OF THE MENISCI, WHICH IN TURN DEPENDS ON THE CONTACT ANGLE OF THE AIR/WATER INTERFACE AGAINST THE SURFACE OF THE SOLID PARTICLES. MENISCI ARE USUALLY ASSUMED TO BE PREDOMINANTLY CONCAVE ON THE SIDE OF THE AIR WITH NEGATIVE WATER PRESSURE (RELATIVE TO THE ATMOSPHERE). EVIDENCE FOR THIS COMES FROM DIRECT OBSERVATIONS AT THE MILLIMETRE SCALE OR FROM THEORETICAL ASSUMPTIONS. THIS NOTE PRESENTS DATA FROM ENVIRONMENTAL SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY OF PARTICLES AT THE MICROMETRE SCALE THAT CONTRADICT THIS ASSUMPTION AND SHOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT, FOR A GIVEN WATER CONTENT, THE CONTACT ANGLE BETWEEN AIR/WATER INTERFACES AND GRAINS CAN GIVE RISE TO A VARIETY OF MENISCUS SHAPES, WITH CURVATURES NOT ALL CONCAVE ON THE SIDE OF AIR. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE CURVATURE OF WATER MENISCI, IN BOTH IDEALISED AND NATURAL GRANULAR MATERIALS WITH VARIABLE PARTICLE SIZES, SHAPES AND NATURE, COULD VARY ALONG THE BORDER OF A SINGLE MENISCUS OR DIFFER FROM ONE POINT TO ANOTHER SEPARATED AT THE MICROMETRE SCALE, AND IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE NATURE OF MATERIALS AND WETTING HISTORY. MENISCI CAN HAVE BOTH PREDOMINANTLY CONVEX SHAPES (CORRESPONDING TO COMPRESSIVE CAPILLARY PRESSURE) AND PREDOMINANTLY CONCAVE SHAPES (CORRESPONDING TO TENSILE CAPILLARY WATER PRESSURE). THESE OBSERVATIONS CONFIRM THE IMPORTANCE OF SURFACE TENSION IN THE AIR/WATER INTERFACES (OFTEN ALSO REFERRED TO AS CONTRACTILE SKIN) IN HOLDING PARTICLES TOGETHER.

THE LIKELIHOOD AND MAGNITUDE OF SUBMARINE SLIDES, AND THE CONSEQUENT IMPACT LOADING ON SEABED INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE PATH OF THE DEBRIS FROM THE SLIDE, MUST BE ESTIMATED. EXPORT PIPELINES ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO IMPACT FROM SUBMARINE SLIDES, BECAUSE OF THEIR LENGTH AND THE NEED TO CROSS CANYONS AND OTHER SEABED FEATURES THAT ARE POTENTIAL PATHS FOR THE FLOWING DEBRIS. CHARACTERISING THE DEBRIS MATERIAL REPRESENTS A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE, AS THE ORIGINAL SOIL, WHICH IS TYPICALLY CHARACTERISED USING CONVENTIONAL GEOTECHNICAL METHODS, EVOLVES THROUGH REMOULDING AND WATER ENTRAINMENT INTO A VISCOUS FLUID. BECAUSE OF THIS TRANSITION FROM SOIL TO FLUID, CHARACTERISATION OF THE STRENGTH OF FLOWING FINE GRAINED SEDIMENT HAS BEEN ADDRESSED SEPARATELY WITHIN A SOIL MECHANICS FRAMEWORK AND A FLUID MECHANICS FRAMEWORK, RESULTING IN TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES FOR EXPRESSING THE STRAIN RATE DEPENDENT STRENGTH OF DEBRIS FLOWS, AND THE CONSEQUENTIAL IMPACT LOADS ON PIPELINES. IN THIS PAPER WE COMPARE THE TWO APPROACHES, AND SHOW THAT THE GEOTECHNICAL CHARACTERISATION OF FINE GRAINED SEDIMENTS CAN BE EXTENDED INTO THE LIQUID RANGE IN A CONTINUOUS FASHION. THIS IS SUPPORTED BY A SERIES OF UNDRAINED SHEAR STRENGTH MEASUREMENTS ON TWO DIFFERENT REMOULDED SOILS, FROM FALL CONE TESTS, VANE SHEAR (INCLUDING VISCOMETER) TESTS, T BAR AND BALL PENETROMETER TESTS. ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS SHOWS THAT THE VARIATION IN SHEAR STRENGTH OVER THE SOLID AND LIQUID RANGES CAN BE DESCRIBED BY A UNIQUE FUNCTION OF WATER CONTENT, FOR A GIVEN SOIL. FURTHERMORE, THE EFFECTS OF RATE OF SHEARING ARE WELL CAPTURED BY A DIMENSIONLESS FUNCTION OF THE NORMALISED STRAIN RATE. THE GEOTECHNICAL APPROACH ALSO ACCOUNTS FOR THE OBSERVED STRENGTH REDUCTION DUE TO INTENSE SHEARING.

THESE MAY MASK THE FIRST ARRIVAL OF THE SHEAR WAVE, MAKING ITS DETECTION DIFFICULT IN THE TIME DOMAIN. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES AN APPROACH FOR MEASURING THE SHEAR WAVE ARRIVAL TIME THROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE OUTPUT SIGNAL IN THE TIMESCALE DOMAIN USING A MULTI SCALE WAVELET TRANSFORM. THE LOCAL MAXIMA LINES OF THE WAVELET TRANSFORM MODULUS ARE OBSERVED AT DIFFERENT SCALES, AND ALL SINGULARITIES ARE MATHEMATICALLY CHARACTERISED, ALLOWING SUBSEQUENT DETECTION OF THE SINGULARITY RELATING TO THE FIRST ARRIVAL. EXAMPLES OF THE USE OF THIS APPROACH ON TYPICAL SYNTHETIC AND EXPERIMENTAL BENDER ELEMENT SIGNALS ARE ALSO SUPPLIED, AND THESE RESULTS ARE COMPARED WITH THOSE FROM OTHER TIME AND FREQUENCY DOMAIN APPROACHES. THE WAVELET APPROACH IS NOT AFFECTED BY NEAR FIELD EFFECTS, BUT INSTEAD IS CHARACTERISED BY A RELATIVELY CONSISTENT SINGULARITY RELATED TO THE SHEAR WAVE ARRIVAL TIME, ACROSS A RANGE OF FREQUENCIES AND NOISE LEVELS.

AS SUCTION IS INCREASED ALONG THE MAIN DRYING CURVE, DRYING OF A BODY IS CONTROLLED BY THE LARGEST THROAT CONNECTED TO IT. AS SUCTION IS REDUCED ALONG THE MAIN WETTING CURVE, THE ABSORBED WATER COLLECTS IN THE SMALLEST BODIES AND THROATS FIRST, AND THEN FILLS LARGER BODIES AND THROATS IN ORDER OF SIZE. THE CURVE IS FITTED TO DATA FOR A SILT LOAM. THE FIT IS REASONABLE FOR MAIN DRYING AND WETTING CURVES, BUT LESS GOOD FOR SCANNING CURVES.

TO AVOID SUCH DIFFICULTIES, CAREFUL THERMAL HYDRAULIC ANALYSIS IS NECESSARY. THIS PRESUPPOSES, OF COURSE, THAT THE RELIABILITY OF THE UNDERLYING COMPUTATIONAL MODELS HAS BEEN VERIFIED BY MEANS OF COMPARISONS WITH THE RESULTS OF APPROPRIATE FIELD TESTS OR PHYSICAL MODELS. AS THERE ARE SCARCELY ANY RESULTS OF SUCH TESTS AVAILABLE IN THE LITERATURE, A NEW LARGE SCALE PHYSICAL MODEL FOR AGF UNDER CONDITIONS OF HIGH SEEPAGE FLOW VELOCITIES HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. THE PRESENT PAPER DOCUMENTS IN DETAIL THE EXPERIMENTAL SET UP, THE THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF THE SOIL MATERIAL, THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS, AND THE RESULTS OF SIX EXPERIMENTS. THESE DATA ARE VALUABLE AS A RELIABLE BASIS FOR THE EVALUATION OF NUMERICAL OR ANALYTICAL PREDICTION MODELS. ADDITIONALLY, THE PAPER DISCUSSES EXISTING CLOSED FORM SOLUTIONS FOR AGF WITH AND WITHOUT SEEPAGE FLOW IN THE LIGHT OF THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE REFRIGERATION TIME AND THE COOLING POWER REQUIRED FOR THE MERGER OF A FREEZE PIPE ROW.

IT IS A SMALL DIAMETER TOOL WITH AN INTAKE SCREEN AND A BUILT IN PRESSURE TRANSDUCER, AND IS DIRECTLY PUSHED INTO THE GROUND. HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY K IS ESTIMATED BY PUMPING FROM AN AQUIFER THROUGH THE INTAKE SCREEN AND, WHILE DOING SO, MEASURING FLOW RATE AND WATER PRESSURE. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES FIRST THE DP SYSTEM AND THEN THE PROCEDURES FOR ESTIMATING K VALUES. THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD WAS EMPLOYED TO OBTAIN INTAKE FACTORS THAT CORRELATE THE MEASUREMENTS WITH THE K VALUES, AND THESE INTAKE FACTORS WERE COMPARED WITH THOSE PROPOSED FOR CONVENTIONAL BOREHOLE PACKER TESTS. LABORATORY AND FIELD EXPERIMENTS WERE ALSO PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE USABILITY OF THE DP EQUIPMENT. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE K ESTIMATES OBTAINED FROM THE NEW PROBE AGREED WITH THOSE OBTAINED BY OTHER METHODS. THE RESULTS OF THIS ASSESSMENT INDICATE THAT THE PROPOSED DP TECHNIQUE IS A PROMISING TOOL FOR SIMPLE AND RAPID IN SITU MEASUREMENTS OF HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY. LIMITATIONS TO THE TECHNOLOGY ARE DISCUSSED, AND FURTHER WORK IS SUGGESTED.

GRILLAGE FOUNDATIONS CONSIST OF A MESH OF VERTICAL GRILLES THAT PENETRATE THE SEABED DURING LOADING. OFFSHORE LOADINGS ON THESE TYPES OF FOUNDATION ARE LIKELY TO CONSIST OF VERTICAL (MOSTLY DEAD WEIGHT) LOADING AND HORIZONTAL INSERVICE LOADS. HOWEVER, TO DATE THERE IS NO ACCEPTED METHOD OF DESIGN, AS FOUNDATION CAPACITY MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THAT OF CONVENTIONAL SOLID SHALLOW FOUNDATIONS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN ANALYTICAL METHOD DESIGNED TO CALCULATE THE VARIATION OF VERTICAL BEARING CAPACITY WITH GRILLE PENETRATION IN SAND. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT GRILLAGES ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE SAME CAPACITY AS SOLID FOUNDATIONS OF THE SAME BREADTH, BUT THIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT PENETRATION OF THE GRILLAGE. CONSEQUENTLY, DESIGN CHOICES ARE LIKELY TO DEPEND ON THE AMOUNT OF SETTLEMENT THE STRUCTURE CAN TOLERATE. SIMPLIFIED ANALYTICAL EQUATIONS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO ALLOW CALCULATION OF THE LOAD SETTLEMENT RESPONSE, AND TO CALCULATE HOW MUCH SETTLEMENT IS REQUIRED TO MOBILISE THE FLAT PLATE CAPACITY OF A SOLID MUDMAT OF THE SAME OVERALL BREADTH. THE METHODOLOGY HAS BEEN VALIDATED BY COMPARING RESULTS WITH THOSE FROM MODEL TESTS.

THIS PAPER DEVELOPS VULNERABILITY AND FRAGILITY FUNCTIONS TO ASSESS BUILDING DAMAGE IN THE CONTEXT OF MINING SUBSIDENCE HAZARDS, COMPARABLE TO FUNCTIONS USED FOR OTHER HAZARDS. THESE FUNCTIONS ARE BASED ON EXISTING ANALYTICAL METHODS FOR DAMAGE ASSESSMENT. THEY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BOTH THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE GEOMETRIC AND MECHANICAL PARAMETERS OF THE BUILDING AND THE SOIL STRUCTURE INTERACTION PHENOMENA THAT MAY HAVE A CRITICAL INFLUENCE ON THE BUILDING LOADING. THE PRESENT PAPER DISCUSSES THE METHODOLOGY USED TO DETERMINE THESE FUNCTIONS, AND THE ANALYTICAL METHOD FOR DAMAGE EVALUATION IS DESCRIBED. THE SECOND PART IS A DETAILED APPLICATION OF THE METHODOLOGY FOR A MASONRY BUILDING WITH OR WITHOUT REINFORCEMENT, FOR WHICH BOTH VULNERABILITY AND FRAGILITY FUNCTIONS ARE CALCULATED.

HOWEVER, THIS TYPE OF INSTABILITY IS DIFFERENT FROM THE RUNAWAY TYPE OF INSTABILITY OBSERVED UNDER UNDRAINED CONDITIONS, AND HAS THEREFORE BEEN CALLED CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY. DESPITE THE DIFFERENCES, THE CONDITIONS FOR BOTH TYPES OF INSTABILITY ARE THE SAME FOR CONTRACTIVE SAND. THERE ARE ALSO OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE PRE FAILURE INSTABILITY OF SAND OBSERVED IN THE LABORATORY. THESE INCLUDE THE STRESS RATIO, VOID RATIO, SAND STATE, LOAD CONTROL MODE AND REDUCTION RATE OF THE EFFECTIVE CONFINING STRESS. IN THIS PAPER, THESE FACTORS ARE DISCUSSED AND ANALYSED USING EXPERIMENTAL DATA OBTAINED FROM UNDRAINED INSTABILITY (OR CREEP) TESTS AND CONSTANT SHEAR DRAINED (CSD) TESTS CARRIED OUT UNDER PLANE STRAIN CONDITIONS.

IN THIS PAPER, THE SHEAR BEHAVIOUR OF REGULAR TRIANGULAR ELASTIC ASPERITIES SUBJECTED TO CONSTANT NORMAL STIFFNESS (CNS) BOUNDARY CONDITIONS IS EXAMINED FOR A RANGE OF YOUNGS MODULI OF THE ROCK. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT DILATION OF THE JOINT DECREASES WITH A DECREASE IN ROCK YOUNGS MODULUS, BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED ELASTIC DEFORMATION OF ASPERITIES.

FROM EQUILIBRIUM RELATIONS, THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF SHEAR STRESS, VELOCITY AND STRAIN RATE ACROSS THE SLIDE THICKNESS ARE DETERMINED ANALYTICALLY FOR TWO RATE DEPENDENT SOIL STRENGTH MODELS. PREVIOUS WORK HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE INCREASE IN SHEAR STRENGTH WITH STRAIN RATE CAN BE ADEQUATELY DESCRIBED USING A POWER LAW OR A LOGARITHMIC LAW MODEL. THE ANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS OBTAINED WITH THESE MODELS ARE COMPARED WITH THE ONES AVAILABLE FOR A VISCOPLASTIC FLUID OF THE BINGHAM OR HERSCHEL BULKLEY TYPES. THE INFLUENCE OF THE RHEOLOGICAL PARAMETERS, THE SLOPE ANGLE AND THE SLIDE THICKNESS ON THE FLOW AND DEFORMATION CHARACTERISTICS IS ANALYSED FOR EACH MODEL. THE DERIVED ANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS CAN BE VIEWED AS REPRESENTING A PARTICULAR POSITION WITHIN A SLIDE AT A GIVEN INSTANT IN TIME. THEY CAN BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH NUMERICAL MODELLING OF THE ENTIRE SLIDE TO PROVIDE SOME INSIGHTS INTO THE FLOW PATTERN, AND INTO THE PARAMETER SENSITIVITY. THESE SOLUTIONS ARE ALSO APPLICABLE TO DETERMINATION OF THE LOADING ON A PIPELINE THAT IS ORIENTED ACROSS THE PATH OF THE SLIDE. THEY ARE USED TO ILLUSTRATE THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE SOIL STRENGTH AND THE INERTIAL DRAG, AS WELL AS THE INFLUENCE OF THE VERTICAL POSITION OF THE PIPELINE WITHIN THE SLIDE.

SUCTION MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE BY USING THE FILTER PAPER METHOD AND AN IN HOUSE CONSTRUCTED HIGH CAPACITY TENSIOMETER (HCT) SO AS TO DETERMINE THE WATER RETENTION CURVE OF THE LOESS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH USING A PREVIOUSLY WETTED FILTER PAPER COULD FRUITFULLY BE USED WITH SUCTION VALUES REASONABLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE HCT MEASUREMENTS. THE WATER RETENTION CURVE OBTAINED EXHIBITED A PECULIAR FORM, WITH NO HYSTERESIS OBSERVED AROUND THE NATURAL WATER CONTENT (14.4%) AND TWO HYSTERESIS LOOPS ON BOTH THE WET AND DRY SIDES OF THE CURVE. IT IS HYPOTHESISED THAT THIS ZONE WITH NO HYSTERESIS CORRESPONDS TO THE NATURAL VARIATIONS OF THE WATER CONTENT UNDER SEASONAL CHANGES, PROVIDING A RANGE OF NATURAL SUCTION BETWEEN 20 AND 80 KPA, AND IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THIS SHOULD BE CHECKED BY IN SITU MEASUREMENTS. THE LOESS MICROSTRUCTURE WAS INVESTIGATED BY USING SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AND MERCURY INTRUSION POROSIMETRY. IT APPEARED THAT THE CLAY FRACTION (16%) WAS NOT UNIFORMLY DISTRIBUTED, WITH SOME AREAS COMPOSED OF CLEAN GRAINS AND A WELL GRADED CORRESPONDING INTERGRAIN PORE POPULATION. CONVERSELY, THE CLAY AGGREGATIONS DEFINE A SMALLER SIZED POROSITY. THE CALCULATION OF A WATER RETENTION CURVE DERIVED FROM THE PORE SIZE DISTRIBUTION CURVE SHOWED THAT WATER RETENTION IS GOVERNED BY CAPILLARITY IN THE LARGEST PORES BETWEEN CLEAN GRAINS, WHEREAS CLAY ADSORPTION BECOMES DOMINANT IN THE SMALLEST PORES, A ZONE WHERE THE MICROSTRUCTURE IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGE IN WATER CONTENT.

THIS PAPER ADVANCES UNDERSTANDING OF THE KEY PARAMETERS FOR THE CONTROL OF STRENGTH AND STIFFNESS OF CEMENTED SOILS BY TESTING TWO SOILS WITH DIFFERENT GRADINGS AND QUANTIFYING THE INFLUENCE OF POROSITY/ CEMENT RATIO ON BOTH INITIAL SHEAR MODULUS (G 0) AND UNCONFINED COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH (Q U). IT IS SHOWN THAT THE POROSITY/CEMENT RATIO IS AN APPROPRIATE PARAMETER TO ASSESS BOTH THE INITIAL STIFFNESS AND THE UNCONFINED COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH OF THE SOIL CEMENT MIXTURES STUDIED. EACH SOIL MATRIX HAS A UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP FOR G 0/Q U AGAINST ADJUSTED POROSITY/CEMENT RATIO, LINKING INITIAL STIFFNESS AND STRENGTH.

THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS STUDY IS TO EXPLORE THE PREDICTION OF 28 DAY MODULUS AND STRENGTH FROM SEISMIC MODULUS DATA COLLECTED DURING EARLY CURING, AND IN GENERAL TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFICACY OF SEISMIC TESTING AS A METHOD OF QUALITY ASSESSMENT FOR LSS. MEASURED E AND G GROWTH RANGED FROM 250% TO 900% DURING CURING FOR THE THREE SOILS. MODULUS VALUES AND GROWTH IN MODULUS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY MINERALOGY AND SOIL PROCESSING. THE GROWTH IN SEISMIC MODULUS FOR EACH SOIL EXHIBITED A POWER LAW RELATIONSHIP WITH CURING TIME. THE 28 DAY MODULUS WAS ESTIMATED WITHIN 8% ERROR FOR TWO SOILS USING EARLY CURING MODULUS DATA, THAT IS, THROUGH 7 DAYS. SEISMIC MODULUS WAS FOUND TO CORRELATE LINEARLY WITH UNCONFINED COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH (Q U) THROUGHOUT CURING. THE PROPORTIONALITY OF E AND Q U REMAINED CONSTANT DURING CURING FOR EACH SOIL BEYOND DAY 3. THE STUDY SHOWS THAT EARLY CURING SEISMIC DATA THAT IS, THROUGH 7, 8 OR 9 DAYS IS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING A GOOD ESTIMATE OF 28 DAY E AND Q U IF THE VARIABILITY IS REASONABLE (HERE, RANGE/MEAN &LT; 0.5).

A COMPLETE THERMODYNAMIC THEORY IS PRESENTED THAT IS CAPABLE OF EXPLAINING THE DEPENDENCE OF YIELDING ON THE DEGREE OF SATURATION IN BRITTLE GRANULAR AGGREGATES. HISTORICALLY, CONSTITUTIVE MODELS REPRESENTED THIS COUPLING BETWEEN MECHANICS AND HYDRAULICS ONLY PHENOMENOLOGICALLY, BY WAY OF THE INCORPORATION OF THE LOADING COLLAPSE CURVE CONCEPT. THIS WAS DONE BOTH FOR FINE GRAINED AND GRANULAR SOILS, AND, FOR THE LATTER CASE, WITHOUT EMBODYING THE PHYSICAL CONNECTION OF YIELDING TO ELASTICITY, AS MOTIVATED BY FRACTURE MECHANICS. HERE, THIS CONNECTION IS CAPTURED BY THE BREAKAGE MECHANICS THEORY, WHICH UNDERPINS A GRAIN SIZE SCALING OF THE MECHANICAL PART OF THE HELMHOLTZ FREE ENERGY POTENTIAL. IN ADDITION, AN EXPLICIT RELIANCE OF THIS POTENTIAL ON HYDRAULIC MEASURES IS EXPLORED, WITH ANOTHER GRAIN SIZE SCALING INSPIRED BY THE CAPILLARY THEORY. IT IS SHOWN THAT THROUGH HOMOGENISATION THESE TWO SCALING LAWS MOTIVATE A TOTAL MACROSCOPIC HELMHOLTZ FREE ENERGY THAT, TOGETHER WITH THE BREAKAGE DISSIPATION, CAPTURES THE SALIENT COUPLINGS BETWEEN MECHANICS AND HYDRAULICS PROPERTIES, WHILE SHOWING A PROMISING AGREEMENT WITH EXPERIMENTS.

THE EFFECT ON THE RESULTS OF VARYING THE RELATIVE DENSITY AND EFFECTIVE CONFINING PRESSURE WAS ALSO STUDIED. THE MEASUREMENTS CLEARLY REVEAL THAT FOR A CERTAIN OPTIMUM S R, WHICH IS AROUND 0.7 0.9% FOR THE CHOSEN SAND, THE VALUE OF THE SHEAR MODULUS G REACHES A MAXIMUM VALUE, WHEREAS THE CORRESPONDING POISSONS RATIO V ATTAINS A MINIMUM VALUE. THE VALUES OF THE SHEAR MODULUS CORRESPONDING TO S R? 0% AND S R100% TEND TOWARDS THE SAME VALUE. FOR VALUES OF SKEMPTONS B PARAMETER GREATER THAN 0.99, THE VALUES OF V P AND V RISE VERY SHARPLY TO THOSE OF WATER.

THESE LIQUEFIED SOILS HAVE A NEAR ZERO EFFECTIVE STRESS STATE, AND HENCE HAVE VERY LOW STRENGTH AND STIFFNESS, CAUSING SEVERE DAMAGE TO STRUCTURES FOUNDED UPON THEM. THE DURATION FOR WHICH THIS NEAR ZERO EFFECTIVE STRESS STATE PERSISTS IS A FUNCTION OF THE RATE OF RECONSOLIDATION OF THE LIQUEFIED SOIL, WHICH IN TURN IS A FUNCTION OF THE PERMEABILITY AND STIFFNESS OF THE SOIL AT THIS VERY LOW EFFECTIVE STRESS. EXISTING LITERATURE BASED ON OBSERVATION OF PHYSICAL MODEL TESTS SUGGESTS THAT THE CONSOLIDATION COEFFICIENT C V ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RECONSOLIDATION OF LIQUEFIED SAND IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT OF THE SAME SOIL AT MODERATE STRESS LEVELS. IN THIS PAPER, THE RESULTS OF A SERIES OF NOVEL FLUIDISATION TESTS IN WHICH PERMEABILITY K AND COEFFICIENT OF CONSOLIDATION C V WERE INDEPENDENTLY MEASURED WILL BE PRESENTED. THESE RESULTS ALLOW CALCULATION OF THE VARIATION OF STIFFNESS E 0 AND PERMEABILITY K WITH EFFECTIVE STRESS. IT IS SHOWN THAT WHILE PERMEABILITY INCREASES MARKEDLY AT VERY LOW EFFECTIVE STRESSES, THE SIMULTANEOUS DROP IN STIFFNESS MEASURED RESULTS IN A DECREASE IN CONSOLIDATION COEFFICIENT AND HENCE AN INCREASE IN THE DURATION FOR WHICH THE SOIL REMAINS LIQUEFIED.

DRAMATIC FAILURES HAVE OCCURRED IN RECENT EARTHQUAKES AS A RESULT OF THE INTERPLAY OF SURFACE STRUCTURES WITH OUT CROPPING FAULT RUPTURES, HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR FAULT INDUCED LOADING IN SEISMIC DESIGN. CURRENT RESEARCH INTO THE MECHANISMS OF FAULT RUPTURE FOUNDATION STRUCTURE INTERACTION HAS REVEALED A POTENTIALLY FAVOURABLE ROLE OF CAISSONS IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER FOUNDATION TYPES. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE MECHANISMS OF NORMAL FAULT RUPTURE INTERACTION WITH RIGID CAISSON FOUNDATIONS, WITH AN INTEGRATED APPROACH USING BOTH EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS. A SERIES OF CENTRIFUGE MODEL TESTS WERE FIRST CONDUCTED TO STUDY THE RESPONSE OF A SQUARE (IN PLAN) CAISSON FOUNDATION OF DIMENSIONS 5M X 35M X 310M, FOUNDED ON A 15 M THICK LAYER OF DRY DENSE SAND. A NONLINEAR THREE DIMENSIONAL NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF THE PROBLEM WAS THEN DEVELOPED, AND ADEQUATELY VALIDATED AGAINST CENTRIFUGE TEST RESULTS. DEPENDING ON ITS POSITION RELATIVE TO THE FAULT, THE CAISSON INTERACTS WITH THE FAULT RUPTURE, SOMETIMES MODIFYING SPECTACULARLY THE FREE FIELD RUPTURE PATH. ACTING AS A KINEMATIC CONSTRAINT, THE CAISSON FORCES THE RUPTURE TO DIVERT ON EITHER ONE, OR BOTH, OF ITS SIDES. THE NUMERICAL STUDY WAS SUBSEQUENTLY EXTENDED TO GAIN FURTHER INSIGHT INTO THE EFFECT OF THE EXACT POSITION OF THE CAISSON RELATIVE TO THE FAULT OUTCROP. DIFFERENT MECHANISMS TAKING PLACE FOR DIFFERENT CAISSON POSITIONS ARE IDENTIFIED, AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE RESPONSE OF THE SYSTEM IS DISCUSSED.

A HOMOGENEOUS FLUID LIKE BEHAVIOUR IS OBTAINED ONLY WITHIN A VERY NARROW RANGE OF CONCENTRATIONS, TYPICALLY NOT MORE THAN 10%. BELOW THIS RANGE THE MATERIAL SEDIMENTATES RAPIDLY; ABOVE THIS RANGE IT BEHAVES LIKE A SOLID. IN THE FLUID LIKE RANGE THE TYPICAL RHEOLOGICAL BEHAVIOUR OF THESE SUSPENSIONS IS THAT OF A YIELD STRESS FLUID EXHIBITING A STATIC YIELD STRESS LARGER THAN ITS DYNAMIC YIELD STRESS. THIS EFFECT PROBABLY FINDS ITS ORIGIN IN A LOCAL SEDIMENTATION EFFECT: THAT IS, THE PARTICLES SEDIMENTATE JUST AS NECESSARY TO FORM A STRUCTURE MORE JAMMED THAN THE STRUCTURE DURING FLOW. AS A RESULT THE FLOW OF SUCH MATERIALS IS USUALLY UNSTABLE: THEY WILL START TO FLOW BEYOND A CRITICAL STRESS, BUT JUST BEYOND THIS VALUE WILL REACH A HIGH SHEAR RATE ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGH FLOWING VELOCITY. THE STATIC AND DYNAMIC YIELD STRESSES OF THESE MATERIALS INCREASE WIDELY FROM VERY LOW TO VERY LARGE VALUES (SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE). INCLINED PLANE TESTS WERE SHOWN TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ALTHOUGH STILL APPROXIMATE VALUES FOR THE STATIC AND DYNAMIC YIELD STRESSES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT IN THE FIELD A SMALL CHANGE IN SOLID FRACTION WILL CAUSE A SLIGHT DECREASE OF THE STATIC YIELD STRESS, READILY INDUCING A RAPID FLOW THAT WILL STOP ONLY WHEN THE DYNAMIC YIELD STRESS IS REACHED, NAMELY ON A MUCH SMOOTHER SLOPE. THIS CAN EXPLAIN THE IN SITU OBSERVED POST FAILURE BEHAVIOUR OF PYROCLASTIC DEBRIS FLOWS, WHICH ARE ABLE TO FLOW OVER VERY LONG DISTANCES, EVEN ON SMOOTH SLOPES.

THE CONCEPT OF A HYDROMECHANICAL ENVELOPE IS PROPOSED IN STRESS GRADIENT SPACE. THE ONSET OF INSTABILITY IS TRIGGERED BY A CRITICAL VALUE OF HYDRAULIC GRADIENT THAT IS FOUND CONSISTENT WITH THE OBSERVATIONS OF TERZAGHI ON PIPING IN UNIFORM SAND, AND THE OBSERVATIONS OF SKEMPTON AND BROGAN ON SEGREGATION PIPING IN WIDELY GRADED SANDY GRAVELS. THE ENVELOPE TAKES THE FORM OF A LINEAR RELATION THAT, FOR A PARTICULAR SOIL, IS GOVERNED BY THE PROPORTION OF EFFECTIVE STRESS IN THE FINER FRACTION OF SOIL GRAINS.

THE RESULTING DATABASE HAS ALLOWED THE CHARACTERISATION OF THE INHERENT MULTI VIBRATIONAL NATURE OF THE SYSTEM, AND THE INTERPRETATION CHALLENGES THAT THIS IMPOSES. THE EXCITATION OF MULTIPLE MODES OF VIBRATION MAY INTRODUCE SIGNAL DISTORTION AND CONSEQUENTLY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUP VELOCITY AND PHASE VELOCITY. THIS MEANS THAT THE COMMON ASSUMPTION OF CONVENTIONAL INTERPRETATION TECHNIQUES THAT GROUP VELOCITY IS EQUAL TO SHEAR WAVE VELOCITY IS IN ERROR. BASED ON THE FEATURES OBSERVED, SYSTEM PARAMETERS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED AND A PARAMETRIC ANALYSIS CARRIED OUT IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEM AND TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF MULTIMODAL VIBRATION AS AN ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE SIGNAL INTERPRETATION.

THREE MODES OF FAILURE ARE CONSIDERED: TENSION FAILURE OF THE BOTTOM MOST LAYER OF REINFORCEMENT, PULLOUT FAILURE OF THE TOPMOST LAYER OF REINFORCEMENT, AND TOTAL PULLOUT FAILURE OF ALL REINFORCEMENT LAYERS. THE ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED BY TREATING BACKFILL PROPERTIES, GEOMETRIC AND STRENGTH PROPERTIES OF REINFORCEMENT AS RANDOM VARIABLES. THE OPTIMUM NUMBER OF REINFORCEMENT LAYERS AND OPTIMUM PULLOUT LENGTH NEEDED TO MAINTAIN STABILITY AGAINST TENSION FAILURE, PULLOUT FAILURE AND TOTAL PULLOUT FAILURE FOR DIFFERENT COEFFICIENTS OF VARIATION OF FRICTION ANGLE OF THE BACKFILL, DESIGN STRENGTH OF THE REINFORCEMENT AND HORIZONTAL SEISMIC ACCELERATION COEFFICIENTS BY TARGETING VARIOUS SYSTEM RELIABILITY INDICES ARE PROPOSED. THE RESULTS PROVIDE GUIDELINES FOR THE TOTAL LENGTH OF REINFORCEMENT REQUIRED, CONSIDERING THE VARIABILITY OF BACKFILL AS WELL AS SEISMIC COEFFICIENTS. ONE ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE IS PRESENTED TO EXPLAIN THE EVALUATION OF RELIABILITY FOR INTERNAL STABILITY OF REINFORCED SOIL STRUCTURES USING THE PROPOSED APPROACH. IN THE SECOND ILLUSTRATION (THE STABILITY OF FIVE WALLS), THE KUSHIRO WALL SUBJECTED TO THE KUSHIRO OKI EARTHQUAKE, THE SEIKEN WALL SUBJECTED TO THE CHIBA KEN TOHO OKI EARTHQUAKE, THE TA KUNG WALL SUBJECTED TO THE JI JI EARTHQUAKE, AND THE GOULD AND VALENCIA WALLS SUBJECTED TO NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE ARE RE EXAMINED.

THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A SERIES OF CENTRIFUGE MODEL TESTS THAT SHED LIGHT ON THE UNDERLYING BEHAVIOUR DURING LARGE AMPLITUDE LATERAL PIPE MOVEMENT. IT IS SHOWN THAT AT LARGE DISPLACEMENTS THE LATERAL RESPONSE IS GOVERNED PREDOMINANTLY BY THE PASSIVE RESISTANCE OF THE GROWING BERM OF SOIL AHEAD OF THE PIPE. USING A NEW ANALYSIS OF THIS GROWING SOIL BERM, BASED ON CONSERVATION OF VOLUME, THE LOCAL EMBEDMENT OF THE PIPE RELATIVE TO THE TOP OF THE IDEALISED SOIL BERM IS DEFINED. IN THIS WAY, THE NORMALISED LATERAL PIPE SOIL RESISTANCE, H/S UD, FROM TESTS ENCOMPASSING A RANGE OF PIPE WEIGHTS AND INITIAL EMBEDMENTS FOLLOWS A SINGLE TREND LINE. THIS IDEALISATION OF THE RESPONSE IS MORE CONSISTENT THAN THE USUAL TERMINOLOGY OF A PIPE SOIL FRICTION FACTOR.

THE HG POROSITY AND PERMEABILITY OF THE ROCKS WERE ANALYSED. THE PERMEABILITY OF THE SPECIMENS WAS DETERMINED DURING AXIAL LOADING AT A CONSTANT TRIAXIAL STATE OF STRESS. GREATER PERMEABILITY CHANGES WERE REGISTERED FOR ROCKS WITH COMPACT STRUCTURE AND LOW POROSITY. THESE TYPES OF ROCK ARE CHARACTERISED BY LINE CONTACTS BETWEEN THE GRAINS. THEY ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO TEMPERATURE INCREASE; PORES WITH A RADIUS GREATER THAN 500 NM INCREASE DUE TO THE TEMPERATURE INFLUENCE, WITH THE PERMEABILITY INCREASING CONSIDERABLY.

USING THE CAVITY EXPANSION ANALOGY, TOGETHER WITH A CONFINED FAILURE MECHANISM, THE RATIO BETWEEN THE TWO QUANTITIES, DEFINED AS A FACTOR S T, IS ESTABLISHED AS A FUNCTION OF THE FRICTION ANGLE, SHEAR STIFFNESS, COMPRESSIBILITY AND MEAN EFFECTIVE STRESS OF THE SAND NEAR THE PILE TIP. IT IS SHOWN THAT, GIVEN OTHERWISE IDENTICAL INPUT PARAMETERS, THE VALUE OF S T WILL DECREASE WITH INCREASING FRICTION ANGLE, AND WITH DECREASING MEAN STRESS LEVEL. IT ALSO TENDS TO DECREASE WITH AN INCREASE IN RELATIVE DENSITY. IT IS PREDICTED THAT S T HAS TYPICAL VALUES BETWEEN 0.03 AND 0.05, IN BROAD AGREEMENT WITH THE RANGE OF EMPIRICALLY DERIVED VALUES IN THE LITERATURE. THE RELATIONSHIP ALSO PREDICTS THAT S T MAY TAKE MUCH HIGHER VALUES (~0.1) FOR PILES INSTALLED IN DENSE SAND OR IN HIGHLY COMPRESSIBLE SAND. BECAUSE OF THE ANALYTICAL NATURE, THE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIP PROVIDES USEFUL INSIGHTS INTO THE MECHANISMS INVOLVED AND IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR DESIGN PRACTICE.

SHALLOW FOUNDATIONS ARE TYPICAL COMPONENTS OF SUCH STRUCTURES, AND THEIR BEHAVIOUR STRONGLY INFLUENCES THE OVERALL SAFETY OF THE TOWER. THIS PAPER IS CONCERNED WITH TWO MAJOR, GEOTECHNICALLY RELATED, FAILURE MODES OF TOWER FOUNDATIONS: (A) BEARING CAPACITY FAILURE, DUE TO LACK OF STRENGTH OF THE SUPPORTING SOIL; AND (B) INSTABILITY OF EQUILIBRIUM, DUE TO LACK OF FOUNDATION STIFFNESS. BOTH OF THESE HAZARDS ARE TACKLED IN A UNIFIED WAY IN THE PAPER, USING A STRAIN HARDENING PLASTICITY MODEL FOR SHALLOW FOOTINGS FROM WHICH A NON LINEAR ROTATIONAL STIFFNESS (MOMENT ROTATION CURVE) FOR THE SOIL FOUNDATION SYSTEM CAN BE DERIVED. THE STABILITY OF EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS IS AUGMENTED BY THE INCLUSION OF ROTATIONAL CREEP, WHICH IS NEW, AND AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF REAL TOWERS. THE PRACTICAL UTILITY OF THE ANALYSIS RESIDES IN ITS SIMPLICITY, INPUT PARAMETERS BEING DERIVED FROM CONVENTIONAL GEOTECHNICAL DATA. THE ANALYSIS PROVIDES NOT ONLY A COMPLETE FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH BOTH FAILURE MECHANISMS CAN BE ASSESSED BUT ALSO A PREDICTION OF WHICH OF THEM IS EVENTUALLY MOST LIKELY TO BE CRITICAL. THE METHODOLOGY IS DEMONSTRATED IN RELATION TO THE PISA TOWER.

BASED ON A LARGE EXPERIMENTAL DATABASE, THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF THE CLAYS IS INVESTIGATED IN THE LIGHT OF THEIR DIFFERENT FISSURING FEATURES, WHICH HAVE BEEN DISTINGUISHED AND CHARACTERISED BY MEANS OF A NEW CHART. THE STUDY ASSUMED THE SOIL TO BE A CONTINUUM, DESPITE THE DIFFERENT FISSURING FEATURES OF THE CLAY FABRIC. THEREFORE LABORATORY TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT ON BOTH NATURAL AND RECONSTITUTED CLAY SAMPLES, AND THE RESULTS WERE COMPARED WITH THOSE RECOGNISED IN THE LITERATURE TO BE TYPICAL OF UNFISSURED SENSITIVE CLAYS. BASED ON THESE COMPARISONS, A BEHAVIOURAL FRAMEWORK IS PROPOSED FOR CLAYS POSSESSING CERTAIN FISSURE STRUCTURES. THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS SHOW THAT THE MINI TO MESOSTRUCTURE OF CLAYS OF FISSURING INTENSITY I5 I6 CAN BE MODELLED AS PART OF THE STRUCTURE VARIABLE CONTROLLING THE CLAY BEHAVIOUR. WHERE THE STRUCTURE VARIABLE REFERS SOLELY TO THE MICRO SCALE FOR UNFISSURED HOMOGENEOUS CLAYS, FOR FISSURED CLAYS I5 I6 IT SPANS FROM THE MICRO TO THE MESO SCALE. AS FOR THE MICROSTRUCTURE OF UNFISSURED CLAYS, THIS MICRO TO MESOSTRUCTURE INFLUENCES THE SOIL RESPONSE AS AN INTERNAL STATE VARIABLE IN ADDITION TO SPECIFIC VOLUME IN CONTROLLING THE MECHANICAL RESPONSE. IN PARTICULAR, IT APPEARS THAT FOR CLAYS OF FISSURING INTENSITY I5 I6, STRUCTURE IS DETRIMENTAL TO STRENGTH, SO THAT THE MATERIAL IS EVEN WEAKER THAN THE RECONSTITUTED CLAY.

IN SOME CASES THE PROCESS IS DIFFICULT, TIME CONSUMING AND COSTLY, BECAUSE THE HIGH EXTRACTION RESISTANCE ON THE JACK UPS SPUDCAN FOOTINGS CAN EXCEED THE CAPACITY OF THE RIG TO PULL. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE IN SOFT CLAY, WHERE SIGNIFICANT SUCTION IS DEVELOPED AT THE SPUDCAN INVERT. THE MAIN OPTION AVAILABLE TO OPERATORS TO EASE THE SPUDCAN EXTRACTION RESISTANCE IS TO USE A JETTING SYSTEM AT THE SPUDCAN INVERT TO ATTEMPT TO BREAK THE SUCTION GENERATED. HOWEVER, THERE IS A GENERAL CONSENSUS WITHIN THE OFFSHORE INDUSTRY THAT JETTING SYSTEMS, UNDER THEIR CURRENT CONFIGURATIONS, HAVE A LIMITED EFFICIENCY. CENTRIFUGE EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS TAKING PLACE DURING JETTING EXTRACTION, AND TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO OPTIMISE THE JETTING PERFORMANCE. A REDUCED SCALE SPUDCAN MODEL SIMULATING A 17. 11 M DIAMETER PROTOTYPE SPUDCAN WITH JETS HAS BEEN TESTED AT 200 TIMES THE ACCELERATION OF EARTHS GRAVITY (KNOWN AS 200G). IT WAS EXTRACTED FROM PENETRATIONS OF UP TO 1.5 DIAMETERS IN NORMALLY CONSOLIDATED CLAY AT VARIABLE EXTRACTION RATES AND VARIABLE JETTING FLOW RATES. MEASUREMENTS OF THE GENERATED SUCTION AND THE TOTAL EXTRACTION RESISTANCE AFTER A PRELOADING PERIOD HAVE PROVIDED INSIGHT INTO THE EXTRACTION MECHANISMS WITH JETTING. THE STUDY HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT JETTING CAN LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN EXTRACTION RESISTANCE, PROVIDED THAT THE EXTRACTION RATE IS FAST ENOUGH TO ENSURE UNDRAINED EXTRACTION, AND THAT A SUFFICIENTLY HIGH FLOW RATE IS APPLIED WITH RESPECT TO THE EXTRACTION RATE.

THE EXPERIMENTAL WORK SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE EFFECT OF THE FOOTING EMBEDMENT WITHIN A WORK HARDENING PLASTICITY APPROACH, WHICH TO DATE HAS BEEN USED PREDOMINANTLY FOR INTERPRETATION OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF SMALL SCALE MODELS OF SURFACE FOUNDATIONS. VERTICAL LOADING AND SWIPE TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT, AND RESULTS ARE COMPARED WITH EXISTING DATA FROM SIMILAR STUDIES ON SMALL SCALE 1G FOUNDATION MODELS. THE OVERALL TREND OF THE CENTRIFUGE RESULTS CONFIRMS THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK, SUGGESTING THAT A WORK HARDENING PLASTICITY APPROACH IN TERMS OF FORCE RESULTANT MODELLING FOR THE SOIL FOOTING SYSTEM (THE SO CALLED MACRO ELEMENT) APPLIES UNDER PROPERLY SCALED STRESS CONDITIONS. THE DATA ALSO INDICATE THAT THE TRADITIONAL ASSUMPTION OF A YIELD SURFACE, ISOTROPICALLY EXPANDING WITH INCREASING VERTICAL PENETRATION IS NOT SUITABLE FOR AN EMBEDDED FOUNDATION. AN ENHANCEMENT OF THE EXISTING YIELD SURFACE FORMULATION ENABLES GENERALISATION OF THE EXISTING WORK HARDENING MODELS FROM SURFACE TO EMBEDDED FOOTINGS.

WITH DETAILED INFORMATION PRODUCED BY THIS PROCEDURE, THE EFFECTS OF SOIL DENSITY AND EARTHQUAKE INTENSITY ON FLOW DEFORMATION OF THE EMBANKMENT ARE EXAMINED. THIS PAPER PROVIDES CONVINCING NUMERICAL EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT EVEN THOUGH STRONGER EARTHQUAKES ALWAYS PRODUCE LARGER DEFORMATION IN THE UPPER SAN FERNANDO DAM, AN EARTHQUAKE SERVES MAINLY AS A TRIGGER TO INITIATE FLOW LIQUEFACTION. ONCE FLOW LIQUEFACTION IS TRIGGERED BY A SUFFICIENTLY STRONG EARTHQUAKE, THE EARTHQUAKE INDUCED FLOW DEFORMATION IS CONTROLLED DOMINANTLY BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SHEAR STRESS REQUIRED FOR EQUILIBRIUM AND THE SHEAR STRENGTH OF THE LIQUEFIED SOIL, WHICH IS DETERMINED BY ITS DENSITY UNDER UNDRAINED EARTHQUAKE LOADING CONDITIONS. THE INFLUENCE OF THE INTENSITY OF THE EARTHQUAKE ITSELF ON FLOW DEFORMATION OF THE EMBANKMENT BECOMES SECONDARY.

THE PROBLEM IS APPROACHED BY DISCUSSING THE CONDITION OF STRAIN LOCALISATION AND, THROUGH A REINTERPRETATION OF THE CONCEPT OF ANGLE OF NATURAL REPOSE, A MODIFIED STRATEGY FOR EVALUATING THE SLOPE SAFETY FACTOR IS INTRODUCED. THE ANGLE OF NATURAL REPOSE IS DEMONSTRATED TO DIFFER SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THE MATERIAL INTERNAL FRICTION ANGLE (AS THIS CAN BE DETERMINED FROM STANDARD TRIAXIAL TESTS). THE ROLE OF NON ASSOCIATIVENESS IS CRITICALLY DISCUSSED AND SIMPLE SHEAR STRESS PATHS ARE NUMERICALLY SIMULATED: PSEUDO HARDENING AND PSEUDO SOFTENING REGIMES ARE DESCRIBED. THE INFLUENCE OF THE LOADING HISTORY ON THE OVERALL DUCTILITY/BRITTLE NESS OF THE SYSTEM MECHANICAL RESPONSE IS ANALYSED. TO STRESS THE DEPENDENCY OF THE ANGLE OF NATURAL REPOSE ON THE MATERIAL DUCTILITY/BRITTLENESS, ADDITIONAL SIMPLE SHEAR NUMERICAL RESULTS ARE ILLUSTRATED FOR THE CASE OF A STRAIN SOFTENING CONSTITUTIVE RELATIONSHIP. FINALLY, THE STABILITY OF THE STRATUM UNDER UNDRAINED CONDITIONS IS CRITICALLY TACKLED WITH REFERENCE TO THE PHENOMENON OF STATIC LIQUEFACTION OF LOOSE SANDS.

THE SAME VALUES FOR ALL THE MODEL PARAMETERS (ALL BUT TWO OF WHICH ARE OBTAINED FROM PUBLISHED DATA) ARE USED FOR ALL SIX TESTS AND VERY GOOD AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE EXPERIMENTAL TEST RESULTS AND THE SIMULATIONS IS ACHIEVED. SIMULATIONS OF DRAINED TESTS ARE ALSO PRESENTED. THE MODEL USES A PARAMETER THAT STORES THE RECENT STRAIN HISTORY OF THE SOIL AND THAT THE AUTHORS SHOW CAN BE RELATED TO HOULSBYS ANISOTROPY PARAMETER. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE VOLUME AND SHEAR STRAIN INCREMENTS CONTAINS TWO TERMS. THE FIRST TERM SIMULATES CONTINUAL COMPACTION WHILE THE SECOND CAN PREDICT ADDITIONAL COMPACTION OR DILATANCY, DEPENDING ON THE DIRECTION OF THE SHEAR STRAIN INCREMENT. THESE TWO TERMS CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT DURING CONTINUOUS DEFORMATION AT THE CRITICAL STATE, BUT REINFORCE EACH OTHER ON REVERSAL TO PREDICT THE RAPID DENSIFICATION OBSERVED EXPERIMENTALLY.

EFFECT OF SHAFT ON RESISTANCE OF A BALL PENETROMETER	2011	GEOTECHNIQUE	61	11		973	981		1	HTTP://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URL?EID2 S2.0 80053995867&PARTNERID40&MD53B216C1473B7ABB769B35D87044075E1	ADVANCED GEOMECHANICS, PERTH, AUSTRALIA; CENTRE FOR OFFSHORE FOUNDATION SYSTEMS, THE UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA, CRAWLEY, PERTH, AUSTRALIA	ZHOU, H., ADVANCED GEOMECHANICS, PERTH, AUSTRALIA; RANDOLPH, M.F., CENTRE FOR OFFSHORE FOUNDATION SYSTEMS, THE UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA, CRAWLEY, PERTH, AUSTRALIA	THE INFLUENCE OF THE SHAFT ON THE RESISTANCE OF A BALL PENETROMETER WAS EXAMINED USING A LARGE DEFORMATION FINITE ELEMENT APPROACH. A RANGE OF BALL SHAFT DIAMETER RATIOS BETWEEN INFINITELY LARGE (NO SHAFT) TO 1 WERE EXAMINED IN TERMS OF RESISTANCE DURING MONOTONIC PENETRATION AND EXTRACTION. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE STEADY STATE RESISTANCE DECREASED WITH DECREASING BALL SHAFT DIAMETER RATIO, AND THAT GREATER DISPLACEMENT (AS A PROPORTION OF THE SHAFT DIAMETER) WAS REQUIRED TO REACH A STEADY STATE. THE FINITE ELEMENT RESULTS WERE MATCHED CLOSELY USING AN UPPER BOUND APPROACH, TREATING THE SHAFT AND OUTER PART OF THE BALL SEPARATELY. IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT THE RIGIDITY INDEX OF THE SOIL AFFECTED THE PENETRATION RESISTANCE OF THE SHAFTED BALL, BUT THE INFLUENCE WAS MUCH LESS THAN FOR A CONE PENETROMETER, BEING ESSENTIALLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE SHAFT BALL AREA RATIO. FINALLY CYCLIC PENETRATION AND EXTRACTION TESTS WERE MODELLED COMPARING RESULTS FOR THE NO SHAFT BALL AND A SHAFTED BALL WITH BALL SHAFT DIAMETER RATIOS OF 2 AND 3. THE PRESENCE OF THE SHAFT WAS FOUND TO HAVE MINIMAL INFLUENCE ON THE RESISTANCE AND CYCLIC DEGRADATION CURVES, ALTHOUGH AT THE LATER STAGE OF CYCLING THE PENETRATION RESISTANCE BECOMES GREATER THAN THE EXTRACTION RESISTANCE. THE CORRESPONDING RESISTANCE RATIO OF EXTRACTION TO PENETRATION FOR EACH CYCLE REDUCES WITH DECREASING BALL SHAFT DIAMETER RATIO AND INCREASING SOIL SENSITIVITY. IN TERMS OF THE CHANGE IN MEAN TOTAL STRESS, HOWEVER, THE PRESENCE OF THE SHAFT INTRODUCES A PRONOUNCED GRADIENT WITH RESPECT TO DISPLACEMENT DURING CYCLIC PENETRATION AND EXTRACTION, WHILE INCREASING THE CHANGES IN MEAN STRESS SIGNIFICANTLY DURING INITIAL PENETRATION.

HOWEVER, THIS MECHANISTIC MODEL DISREGARDS THE COHESIONLESS, EFFECTIVE STRESS DEPENDENT FRICTIONAL BEHAVIOUR OF FINE GRAINED SOILS. AN ALTERNATIVE THEORY IS EXPLORED USING ANALYSES, NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS BASED ON AN EFFECTIVE STRESS FORMULATION, AND EXPERIMENTS MONITORED USING HIGH RESOLUTION TIME LAPSED PHOTOGRAPHY. RESULTS SHOW THAT DESICCATION CRACKS IN FINE GRAINED SEDIMENTS INITIATE AS THE AIR WATER INTERFACE INVADES THE SATURATED MEDIUM, DRIVEN BY THE INCREASE IN SUCTION. THEREAFTER, THE INTERFACIAL MEMBRANE CAUSES AN INCREASE IN THE LOCAL VOID RATIO AT THE TIP, THE AIR ENTRY VALUE DECREASES, THE AIR WATER INTERFACE ADVANCES INTO THE TIP AND THE CRACK GROWS. THE EFFECTIVE STRESS REMAINS IN COMPRESSION EVERYWHERE IN THE SOIL MASS, INCLUDING AT THE TIP OF THE DESICCATION CRACK. THIS CRACK GROWING MECHANISM CAN EXPLAIN VARIOUS OBSERVATIONS RELATED TO DESICCATION CRACK FORMATION IN FINEGRAINED SOILS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF PORE FLUID SALT CONCENTRATION, SLOWER CRACK PROPAGATION VELOCITY AND RIGHT ANGLE REALIGNMENT WHILE APPROACHING A PRE EXISTING CRACK, AND THE APPARENT STRENGTH AND FAILURE MODE OBSERVED IN FINE GRAINED SOILS SUBJECTED TO TENSION. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS REQUIRED TO DEVELOP A COMPLEMENTARY PHENOMENOLOGICAL MODEL FOR DESICCATION CRACK FORMATION IN COARSE GRAINED SEDIMENTS.

SEPARATE STRUCTURAL AND GEOTECHNICAL ANALYSES ARE INCAPABLE OF MAKING SUCH PREDICTIONS, SO IN THIS WORK INTEGRATED STRUCTURAL/GEOTECHNICAL SIMULATIONS ARE EVALUATED AGAINST DETAILED EXPERIMENTAL PUSHOVER DATA. THE COMMERCIAL FINITE ELEMENT PROGRAM ABAQUS IS USED, WITH STANDARD BEAM ELEMENTS REPRESENTING THE JACK UP STRUCTURE AND A USER DEFINED ELEMENT DESCRIBING THE BEHAVIOUR OF EACH SPUDCAN FOOTING BY MEANS OF A FORCE RESULTANT PLASTICITY MODEL. THIS MODEL TAKES A MACRO ELEMENT APPROACH BY EXPRESSING THE FOUNDATION BEHAVIOUR PURELY IN TERMS OF THE LOADS ON THE SPUDCAN AND THE CORRESPONDING DISPLACEMENTS. ALTHOUGH THE MODEL HAS PROVEN ABILITY TO SIMULATE THE SINGLE FOOTING EXPERIMENTS FROM WHICH IT WAS DERIVED, THE LOAD PATHS EXPERIENCED BY THE SPUDCANS OF A THREE LEGGED JACK UP ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. TO INVESTIGATE THIS, NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF THREE EXPERIMENTAL PUSHOVER TESTS ON A 1:250 SCALE MODEL JACK UP HAVE BEEN PERFORMED. THE TESTS REPRESENT JACK UPS WITH DIFFERENT LEG LENGTHS AND LOAD ORIENTATIONS. THE INTEGRATED NUMERICAL MODELLING APPROACH SUCCESSFULLY PREDICTS THREE DIFFERENT FAILURE MODES, ALTHOUGH THE PREDICTIONS OF ULTIMATE PUSHOVER CAPACITY ARE CONSISTENTLY CONSERVATIVE. BECAUSE PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED PARAMETERS WERE USED FOR THE FOUNDATION MODEL, THESE PREDICTIONS DEMONSTRATE THE VERSATILITY OF THE SPUDCAN MODEL IN THE CONTEXT OF A MULTI FOOTING STRUCTURE, AND CONFIRM THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTEGRATED ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE.

THE MATERIAL THEY ARE COMPOSED OF IS RATHER PECULIAR, HAVING A MAN MADE ORIGIN, AND THEIR BEHAVIOUR IS STILL NOT VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD. THE SOIL FROM THE STAVA TAILINGS DAMS, STRUCTURES THAT WERE SUBJECT TO LIQUEFACTION IN 1985 CAUSING EXTENSIVE DESTRUCTION, WAS INVESTIGATED IN THIS STUDY AS AN EXAMPLE OF TAILINGS. TWO MAIN ASPECTS OF THEIR BEHAVIOUR HAVE BEEN EXAMINED: THE INFLUENCE OF THE PERCENTAGE OF SILT AND SAND THAT COMPOSE THE SOIL ON ITS MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR, AND THE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO LIQUEFACTION, ANALYSING THE BEHAVIOUR WITHIN A CRITICAL STATE FRAMEWORK. IN THIS PAPER IT IS SHOWN THAT, AS THE QUANTITY OF SILT INCREASES, THE SLOPE AND INTERCEPT OF THE NORMAL COMPRESSION LINE AND CRITICAL STATE LINE AT HIGHER PRESSURES DECREASE UNTIL AN INVERSION OF BEHAVIOUR IS OBSERVED, WHILE AT LOWER STRESS LEVELS THE CRITICAL STATE LINE CHANGES ITS POSITION BUT NOT ITS SLOPE. THIS MEANS THAT THE EFFECT OF ADDING SILT ON THE CRITICAL STATE LINE LOCATION AT LOW STRESSES IS DISCONNECTED FROM THAT AT HIGH STRESSES. THE ANALYSIS OF LIQUEFACTION WITHIN A CRITICAL STATE FRAMEWORK WAS FOUND TO PROVIDE A SIMPLE EXPLANATION FOR THE PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOUR THAT ARE TYPICAL OF STATIC LIQUEFACTION. THREE CLASSES OF BEHAVIOUR RELATED TO THE CURRENT VOID RATIO AND STRESS STATE OF THE SOIL WERE IDENTIFIED.

THEIR PERFORMANCE IN RELATION TO BEARING CAPACITY IS WELL DOCUMENTED, BUT THERE IS ALSO A NEED FOR ENHANCED UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR SETTLEMENT CHARACTERISTICS, PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO SMALL GROUP CONFIGURATIONS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS RESULTS OBTAINED FROM PHYSICAL MODEL TESTS ON TRIAXIAL SPECIMENS 300 MM IN DIAMETER AND 400 MM HIGH. PARAMETERS INVESTIGATED INCLUDE COLUMN LENGTH TO DIAMETER RATIO, AREA REPLACEMENT RATIO AND SINGLE/GROUP CONFIGURATION. THE FINDINGS OF THE WORK ARE AS FOLLOWS. THE DESIGN IS FLEXIBLE: SETTLEMENT CAN EQUALLY BE CONTROLLED USING SHORT COLUMNS AT RELATIVELY HIGH AREA REPLACEMENT RATIOS, OR LONGER COLUMNS AT SMALLER AREA REPLACEMENT RATIOS. AN OPTIMUM AREA REPLACEMENT RATIO OF 30 40% EXISTS FOR THE CONTROL OF SETTLEMENT. THE SETTLEMENT PERFORMANCE OF A SMALL COLUMN GROUP IS HIGHLY INFLUENCED BY INTER COLUMN AND FOOTING INTERACTION EFFECTS.

THE SCHEME SOLVES FOR FLUID PRESSURE IN VOID SPACES SURROUNDED BY THE PARTICLE ELEMENTS USED IN THE DISCRETEELEMENT METHOD TO CONSIDER THE COMPRESSIBILITY OF FLUID DURING PARTICLE MOVEMENT AND DIFFUSION, THAT IS FLOW ACROSS VOID SPACES IN A ONE DIMENSIONAL FORM OF DARCYS LAW. THE CALCULATED FLUID PRESSURE IS APPLIED TO PARTICLES INVOLVED IN THE VOID SPACE AS A BODY FORCE PROPORTIONAL TO THE OCCUPIED AREA IN THE SPACE. THIS MICROSCOPIC TWO WAY COUPLING METHOD ENABLES THE ANALYSIS OF THE MICROSCOPIC MECHANICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF GRANULAR MATERIALS ASSOCIATED WITH FLUID, AS MANY PROBLEMS IN GEOTECHNICS INVOLVE SUCH INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PARTICLES AND A PORE FLUID.

THIS FOLLOWS A PREVIOUS STUDY WHICH SHOWS THAT SUCH TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE MAY SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT THE INTERPRETATION OF THERMAL FAILURE IN LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS. EVEN IF THE THERMAL INCREASE OF THE INTERNAL FRICTION IS QUITE MODEST (LESS THAN 20% IN TERMS OF THE CRITICAL STATE PARAMETER, M), IT AFFECTS QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY THE EFFECTIVE STRESS PATH NEAR THE HEAT SOURCE. THE EFFECTIVE STRESS PATH APPROACHES THE YIELD LOCUS AND THE CRITICAL STATE AT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PRINCIPAL STRESS DIFFERENCE VALUES FOR THE VARIABLE INTERNAL FRICTION THAN FOR THE M CONST CASE. THE MEAN EFFECTIVE STRESS DISTANCE FROM THE CRITICAL STATE IS SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED DURING HEATING, WHICH IN THE CASE OF SMALL PERTURBATIONS OF ANY PARAMETER MAY LEAD TO POTENTIALLY UNSTABLE OR STATICALLY INADMISSIBLE BEHAVIOUR. THE SOLUTIONS OBTAINED ALLOW ONE TO IDENTIFY ZONES OF INFLUENCE AROUND THE HEAT SOURCE OF SEVERAL VARIABLES OF INTEREST. THE TWO FIELDS MOST AFFECTED BY THE THERMAL SENSITIVITY OF M ARE THAT OF THE AXIAL STRESS, DROPPING SIGNIFICANTLY NEAR THE HEAT SOURCE, AND THAT OF THE APPEARANCE OF THE THERMOPLASTIC STRAIN. BOTH ZONES OF INFLUENCE ARE REDUCED IN SIZE BY ALMOST HALF WHEN THE FRICTION ANGLE IS INCREASED BY 20% OVER 70. THE PRESENTED RESULTS MAY BE OF RELEVANCE TO THE DESIGN OF PROTOTYPE IN SITU INSTALLATIONS AND THEIR MONITORING, AND EVENTUALLY OF ACTUAL FACILITIES FOR NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL.

IN PARTICULAR, FOUR CONSTITUTIVE MODELLING APPROACHES HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED: A SIMPLE ELASTO PLASTIC CONSTITUTIVE MODEL (MODIFIED CAM CLAY), WITH AND WITHOUT RAYLEIGH DAMPING; THE SAME MODEL COUPLED WITH A CYCLIC NON LINEAR MODEL THAT CAN SIMULATE PRE YIELD HYSTERESIS; AND FINALLY AN ADVANCED KINEMATIC HARDENING MODEL, WHICH IS AN IMPROVED VERSION OF THE AL TABBAA & WOOD TWO SURFACE MODEL. THESE FOUR APPROACHES ARE USED TO ANALYSE THE SEISMIC RESPONSE OF A SECTION OF THE BOLU TUNNELS DURING THE 1999 DUZCE EARTHQUAKE. TO SHED LIGHT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CONSTITUTIVE MODELS, SIMPLE SITE RESPONSE FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSES WERE FIRST UNDERTAKEN FOR THE STUDIED SITE, PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE CALIBRATION OF THE RAYLEIGH DAMPING PARAMETERS. THE RESULTS OF THESE ANALYSES, IN TERMS OF MAXIMUM SHEAR STRAIN, WERE THEN USED AS INPUT TO AN ANALYTICAL ELASTIC METHOD (EXTENDED HOEG METHOD) FOR CALCULATING THE THRUST AND BENDING MOMENT ACTING IN THE TUNNEL LINING. FINALLY THE RESULTS OF DYNAMIC TIME DOMAIN PLANE STRAIN ANALYSES, EMPLOYING THE FOUR ADOPTED CONSTITUTIVE MODELLING APPROACHES, ARE COMPARED AGAINST FIELD OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS OBTAINED BY THE EXTENDED HOEG METHOD, TO INVESTIGATE THE ABILITY OF THE MODELS, OF RANGING COMPLEXITY, TO MIMIC SOIL RESPONSE UNDER SEISMIC EXCITATION.

HOWEVER, THE TIME USED TO COMPLETE PRIMARY CONSOLIDATION IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FOR LABORATORY SPECIMENS AND IN SITU SOIL LAYERS. TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT CASES, REFERRED TO AS CREEP HYPOTHESES A AND B, HAVE BEEN USED AS A BASIS OF DISCUSSION TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF CREEP DURING THE PRIMARY CONSOLIDATION PHASE. SEVERAL LABORATORY AND FIELD EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF SOIL LAYER THICKNESS ON THE TIME DEPENDENT COMPRESSIBILITY OF A SOIL LAYER. SOME OF THESE TESTS SEEMED TO SUPPORT HYPOTHESIS A, OTHERS HYPOTHESIS B, AND IN SOME CASES SHOWED A BEHAVIOUR BETWEEN THE TWO. AS A RESULT THIS QUESTION HAS CONTINUED TO BE A CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC AMONG RESEARCHERS, AND REMAINS TO BE AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED. IN THIS STUDY, SOME RELEVANT EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS FROM THE LITERATURE ARE THOROUGHLY STUDIED AND CRITICALLY REVIEWED, AND ALSO EXPLAINED CONSISTENTLY USING THE ISOTACHE CONCEPT. THIS WORK INDICATES THAT THE ISOTACHE APPROACH CAN CAPTURE THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TIME DEPENDENT COMPRESSIBILITY OF CLAYS DURING BOTH THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CONSOLIDATION PHASES. IT IS ALSO SHOWN THAT THE MISUSE OF THE ISOTACHE CONCEPT, AS REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE, MAY GIVE A CONFUSING PICTURE OF REALITY. BASED ON THE CONSIDERED DATA, IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE MEASURED TIME DEPENDENT COMPRESSIBILITY OF CLAYS AGREES WELL WITH HYPOTHESIS B.

AN INTENSIVE CALIBRATION PROGRAMME WAS CONDUCTED AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES (20 35C) AND WATER POTENTIAL LEVELS (0.0 TO, ~7.0 MPA), FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE THERMAL GRADIENT WAS EXPRESSED AS THE DIFFERENCE IN TEMPERATURE BETWEEN WET AND DRY JUNCTIONS IN THE THERMOCOUPLE PSYCHROMETER SENSOR. THE COLLECTED CALIBRATION DATA WERE USED TO BUILD AN ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK PSYCHROMETER MODEL. THE DEVELOPED MODEL WAS ABLE TO SIMULATE SUCCESSFULLY THE PSYCHROMETER OUTPUT AT DIFFERENT CONDITIONS, AND WAS USED TO CONDUCT A DETAILED PARAMETRIC STUDY TO EVALUATE THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE AND THERMAL GRADIENT ON THERMOCOUPLE PSYCHROMETER MEASUREMENTS. THE OUTCOME OF THIS STUDY SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE AND THERMAL GRADIENT IN THE STANDARD CALIBRATION PROCESS. MOREOVER, IT INTRODUCES A NEW, PRECISE CALIBRATION PROTOCOL THAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH.

THIS UNSTABLE SLOPE LIES BETWEEN A HOSPITAL AT THE TOP AND AN ABANDONED QUARRY AT THE TOE: THE QUARRY WAS ACTIVE UNTIL THE END OF THE 1970S. A FIRST LANDSLIDE OCCURRED AROUND 1980, AND WAS CHARACTERIZED BY A SUBSEQUENT RETROGRESSIVE EVOLUTION. THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN INTERPRETATION OF THE SLOPE FAILURE MECHANISM BASED ON THE RESULTS OF GEOMORPHOLOGICAL STUDIES, FIELD MONITORING, LABORATORY TESTING, AND BOTH LIMIT EQUILIBRIUM AND COUPLED NUMERICAL ANALYSES, THESE LATTER CARRIED OUT WITH FLAC2D. IN PARTICULAR, THE NUMERICAL ANALYSES HAVE BEEN PERFORMED IN ORDER TO INTERPRET THE EVOLUTION OF THE SLOPE MOVEMENTS WITH TIME, AND TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF THE QUARRYING INDUCED EXCESS PORE PRESSURES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FAILURE PROCESS. THE NUMERICAL RESULTS SHOW THAT DURING THE EXCAVATION STAGES THE NEGATIVE EXCESS PORE WATER PRESSURES DUE TO UNDRAINED UNLOADING ALLOWED FOR A TEMPORARY STABILITY OF THE SLOPE. THE ANALYSES ALSO INDICATE THAT THE PROCESS OF PORE PRESSURE EQUALISATION TRIGGERED THE 1980 FAILURE, AND INITIATED THE RETROGRESSIVE EVOLUTION OF THE LANDSLIDE.

A SERIES OF PARAMETRIC ANALYSES ARE PRESENTED IN THE PAPER USING AS EXCITATION NUMEROUS NEAR FAULT RECORDED SEVERE GROUND MOTIONS AND IDEALIZED WAVELETS, BEARING THE EFFECTS OF FORWARD DIRECTIVITY AND FLING STEP. USING AS KEY PARAMETERS THE ANGLE BETA OF THE SLOPING PLANE (MIMICKING THE SLIDING SURFACE), AS WELL AS THE FREQUENCY CONTENT, INTENSITY, NATURE AND POLARITY OF THE EXCITATION, THE PAPER AIMS AT DEVELOPING A DEEPER INSIGHT INTO THE MECHANICS OF THE ASYMMETRIC SLIDING PROCESS AND THE ROLE OF KEY PARAMETERS OF THE EXCITATION. IT IS SHOWN THAT DIRECTIVITY AND FLING AFFECTED MOTIONS CONTAINING LONG PERIOD ACCELERATION PULSES AND LARGE VELOCITY STEPS, ARE PARTICULARLY DESTRUCTIVE FOR THE EXAMINED SYSTEMS. THE AMOUNT OF ACCUMULATING SLIP ON A STEEP SLOPE IS PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO REVERSAL OF THE POLARITY OF EXCITATION. WITH SOME SPECIAL GROUND MOTIONS, IN PARTICULAR (SUCH AS THE SAKARYA AND YARIMCA ACCELEROGRAMS, BOTH RECORDED 3 KM FROM THE SURFACE EXPRESSION OF THE NORTH ANATOLIAN FAULT THAT RUPTURED IN THE 1999 KOCAELI EARTHQUAKE), WHAT MIGHT AT FIRST GLANCE APPEAR ELUSIVELY AS SMALL DETAILS IN THE RECORD MAY TURN OUT TO EXERT A PROFOUND INFLUENCE ON THE MAGNITUDE OF SLIPPAGE FAR OUTWEIGHING THE EFFECTS OF PEAK ACCELERATION, PEAK VELOCITY AND ARIAS INTENSITY. THE RESULTS ARE COMPILED IN BOTH DIMENSIONLESS AND DIMENSIONAL CHARTS, AND COMPARED WITH CLASSICAL CHARTS FROM THE LITERATURE.

THE STUDY UTILISED A SPECIAL TRIAXIAL TESTING APPARATUS THAT INCORPORATES LOCAL STRAIN MEASURING SYSTEM AND ELASTIC WAVE VELOCITY MEASUREMENT SYSTEM. ISOTROPICALLY CONSOLIDATED DRAINED COMPRESSION TESTS AND SHEAR WAVE VELOCITY MEASUREMENTS WERE UNDERTAKEN ON BOTH VERTICALLY AND HORIZONTALLY CUT SPECIMENS. THE EXPERIMENTS WERE PERFORMED UNDER IN SITU ISOTROPIC STRESSES TO STUDY THE INHERENT ANISOTROPIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CLAYS IN TERMS OF THE ELASTIC STIFFNESS. THE DEFORMATION CHARACTERISTICS DURING TRIAXIAL COMPRESSION WERE CAREFULLY INVESTIGATED TO OBTAIN VARIOUS ELASTIC MODULI AND POISSON RATIOS.

THE METHOD IS APPLIED TO SIMULATE THE CONSTRUCTION AND FAILURE OF THE AZNALCOLLAR DAM. THE BRITTLE FOUNDATION CLAY IS CHARACTERISED BY MEANS OF A STRAIN SOFTENING MOHR COULOMB ELASTO PLASTIC MODEL. THE RUPTURE PROCESS OF THE FOUNDATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH A PROGRESSIVE FAILURE MECHANISM. THE MODEL PREDICTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LOCALISED SHEARING BAND THAT INITIATES AT THE TOE OF THE DAM AT SOME INTERMEDIATE STAGE OF CONSTRUCTION, AND PROPAGATES DOWNSTREAM AND UPSTREAM.

THESE MODEL SLOPES HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTED WITH MINIATURE HIGH CAPACITY TENSIOMETERS, AND THE DEFORMATIONS OF THEIR CROSS SECTIONS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED BY DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY AND ANALYSED BY PARTICLE IMAGE VELOCIMETRY. SEQUENCES OF SWELLING AND SHRINKAGE HAVE BEEN SEEN TO BE POTENTIALLY IRREVERSIBLE, LEADING TO CREEP IN THE FORM OF DOWN SLOPE RATCHETING, ACCOMPANIED BY PROGRESSIVE REGIONAL SOFTENING WITHIN THE ZONE AFFECTED BY THE SEASONAL MOISTURE MOVEMENTS. ULTIMATELY, THIS REGIONAL SOFTENING HAS BEEN SEEN TO LEAD TO SLOPE FAILURES, IN WHICH SEGMENTS OF SOIL HAVE SEPARATED FROM THE MASS THROUGH THE OPENING OF TENSION CRACKS AND THE FORMATION OF A LOCALISED SHEAR RUPTURE. AN ANALYSIS OF THE PHASE OF EPISODIC REGIONAL SOFTENING IS PRESENTED HERE, BASED ON A SPENCER LIMIT EQUILIBRIUM APPROACH. THESE BACK ANALYSES ILLUSTRATE THAT CLAY SLOPES WHICH TEMPORARILY MOBILISE AN AVERAGE STRESS RATIO IN EXCESS OF THE CRITICAL STATE STRESS RATIO DURING ANY PORTION OF A TYPICAL YEAR MAY EVENTUALLY BE BROUGHT TO A LONG TERM FAILURE UNDER THE ACTION OF SEASONAL VARIATIONS OF PORE PRESSURE. CONVERSELY, IT IS HYPOTHESISED THAT CLAY SLOPES WHICH CAN MAINTAIN THEIR OVERALL EQUILIBRIUM WITHOUT EXCEEDING THE CRITICAL STATE STRESS RATIO MAY NOT EXPERIENCE PROGRESSIVE SEASONAL SOFTENING.

A SIMPLE ANALYTICAL MODEL HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO ASSESS THE SWELLING OF THE SOIL DURING THE STEADY STATE GAS PRODUCTION, AND TO PREDICT IMMEDIATE SETTLEMENTS DUE TO LOADING AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS. FOR EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION OF THE SUGGESTED TECHNIQUE, CLOSTRIDIUM ACETOBUTYLICUM, AN ANAEROBIC FERMENTATIVE MICROORGANISM, WAS MIXED INTO CLAYEY SAND SAMPLES, FED WITH A NUTRIENT RICH MEDIUM, AND ALLOWED TO PRODUCE GAS IN SITU. A SERIES OF STANDARD OEDOMETER TESTS WAS PERFORMED ON GAS CONTAINING AND GAS FREE SOIL SPECIMENS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT, IN AGREEMENT WITH THE MODEL PREDICTIONS, IN SITU GAS PRODUCTION CAUSED NEGLIGIBLE SWELLING OF THE SAMPLES, WHILE SHIFTING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION (UP TO 50%) OF TOTAL DISPLACEMENT FROM PRIMARY CONSOLIDATION SETTLEMENT TO IMMEDIATE SETTLEMENT WITHOUT CHANGING TOTAL DISPLACEMENTS OR THE COEFFICIENT OF CONSOLIDATION.

HOWEVER, ITS VARIATION WITH STRESS LEVEL, FABRIC AND PARTICLE DAMAGE HAS BEEN DEBATED. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE YIELD AND CRITICAL STATE FRICTION ANGLES OF THREE SANDS USING TRIAXIAL COMPRESSION AND RING SHEAR TESTS. ONLY CONTRACTIVE RESPONSES WERE USED TO DEFINE THE YIELD FRICTION ANGLES AND THE CRITICAL STATE FRICTION ANGLES FROM THE TRIAXIAL TESTS. HOWEVER, BOTH CONTRACTIVE AND DILATIVE (THROUGH PARTICLE DAMAGE) SPECIMENS REACHED A CRITICAL STATE IN THE RING SHEAR TESTS, AND THEREFORE CRITICAL STATE FRICTION ANGLES WERE DEFINED FROM BOTH DENSE AND LOOSE SPECIMENS. THE YIELD FRICTION ANGLE WAS AFFECTED BY THE INITIAL SAND FABRIC, DECREASING AS THE PRE SHEAR VOID RATIO INCREASED. IN CONTRAST, THE CRITICAL STATE FRICTION ANGLE FROM THE RING SHEAR TESTS WAS INDEPENDENT OF STRESS PATHS ANALYSED IN THIS PAPER, INDEPENDENT OF INITIAL SAND FABRIC, AND DECREASED ONLY SLIGHTLY WITH STRESS LEVEL, BECOMING ESSENTIALLY CONSTANT AT STRESSES LARGER THAN ABOUT 200 KPA. ITS VALUE DEPENDED PRIMARILY ON PARTICLE MINERALOGY AND SHAPE (ANGULARITY). PARTICLE DAMAGE INDUCED IN THE RING SHEAR TESTS INCREASED THE CRITICAL STATE FRICTION ANGLE BY A FEW DEGREES, AS A WIDER RANGE OF PARTICLE SIZES AND MORE ANGULAR PARTICLES WERE PRODUCED.

THE RADIAL STRESSES THAT DEVELOP ON BURIED FLEXIBLE PIPES HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED BY A NUMBER OF RESEARCHERS THROUGH EXPERIMENTAL, ANALYTICAL AND NUMERICAL METHODS. HOWEVER, DIRECT MEASUREMENTS OF SOIL CONTACT STRESSES ACTING ON SMALL DIAMETER PIPES HAVE NOT BEEN POSSIBLE, SINCE COMMERCIAL EARTH PRESSURE CELLS ARE LARGE, AND THE STIFFNESS OF THE CELL RELATIVE TO THE SOIL MATERIAL IS KNOWN TO INFLUENCE THE MEASURED STRESSES. A NEW TECHNIQUE IS DESCRIBED FOR MEASURING THE RADIAL CONTACT STRESSES ACTING ON BURIED PIPES, AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ARE REPORTED THAT DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS NEW TECHNIQUE FOR MEASURING CONTACT PRESSURES FOR BOTH LOOSE AND COMPACTED SAND BACKFILLS. COMPARISON OF THE MEASUREMENTS WITH COMPUTATIONS FROM ELASTIC SOIL PIPE INTERACTION THEORY REVEALS SIGNIFICANT DISCREPANCIES IN THE MAGNITUDE AND DISTRIBUTION OF RADIAL PRESSURE AROUND THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE PIPE FOR BOTH LOOSE AND COMPACTED BACKFILL CONDITIONS. THE NEW MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES DIRECT SUPPORT FOR PRESSURE DISTRIBUTIONS INFERRED IN EARLIER STUDIES FROM MEASUREMENTS OF CIRCUMFERENTIAL STRAINS AROUND THE PIPE CIRCUMFERENCE.

LANDFILLS ARE CONSIDERED AS HETEROGENEOUS POROUS STRUCTURES, IN WHICH FLOW AND TRANSPORT PROCESSES OF GASES AND LIQUIDS ARE COMBINED WITH LOCAL MATERIAL DEGRADATION AND MECHANICAL DEFORMATION OF THE SOLID SKELETON. THIS CONTRIBUTION DEALS WITH A CONSTITUTIVE MODEL FOCUSING ON THE MECHANICAL DEFORMATION BEHAVIOUR OF THE DISPOSED WASTE DIVIDING THE SOLID MATERIAL INTO TWO DIFFERENT FRACTIONS. THE FIRST FRACTION INCLUDES MORE GRAINY PARTICLES AND HAS PROPERTIES COMPARABLE WITH GRANULAR MATERIALS. THE SECOND FRACTION CONSISTS OF MORE FIBROUS CONSTITUENTS HAVING AN IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON THE STRENGTH OF THE COMPOSITE MATERIAL. STRESS STRAIN BEHAVIOUR OF THE TWO FRACTIONS IS MODELED ACCORDING TO THE THEORY OF FINITE ELASTO PLASTICITY. SETTLEMENTS GENERATED BY MECHANICAL CREEP ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN THE MODEL. THE DEVELOPED CONSTITUTIVE MODEL IS VALIDATED AND CALIBRATED ON RESULTS FROM LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS APPLYING GENETIC ALGORITHMS. NUMERICAL ANALYSES USING THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD SHOW THE CAPABILITY OF THE PRESENTED APPROACH.

HOWEVER, REGARDLESS OF IDEALISATION ADOPTED FOR STRESS DILATANCY, THE SCALING COEFFICIENT EVOLVES AND ONLY ATTAINS THE CRITICAL FRICTION RATIO AT LARGE STRAIN. THE SCALING COEFFICIENT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE PROPORTION OF INTERMEDIATE PRINCIPAL STRESS. DATA ON STRESS DILATANCY IN TRIAXIAL COMPRESSION AND PLANE STRAIN ARE REVIEWED. BASED ON THESE DATA, A SIMPLE FUNCTION IS PROPOSED FOR STRESS DILATANCY SCALING USING AN OPERATIONAL FRICTION RATIO MI BASED ON WORKCONJUGATE STRESS AND STRAIN INVARIANTS. THE FUNCTION IS CALIBRATED TO SOIL PROPERTIES MEASURED IN CONVENTIONAL DRAINED TRIAXIAL TESTS (ABOUT THREE, SUITABLY CHOSEN, TESTS ARE NEEDED IN ADDITION TO THOSE USED TO DEFINE THE CRITICAL STATE LOCUS) AND PREDICTS STRENGTH IN PLANE STRAIN TO AN ACCURACY OF4 60.03 AT 80% CONFIDENCE FOR THE BRASTED AND CHANGI SANDS CONSIDERED (I.E. ABOUT 6 3% OF TYPICAL PEAK STRENGTH). THE PROPOSED FUNCTION IS SUITABLE FOR ANY SOIL CONSTITUTIVE MODEL THAT INCLUDES A CRITICAL STATE LINE AND WHICH INVOKES STRESS DILATANCY.

PURSUED WITH THE DUAL PURPOSE OF EXTENDING THE CONVENTIONAL FORMULATION OF DYNAMIC TEST PROGRAMMES AS WELL AS GENERATING A PHYSICAL DATABASE WITH SUFFICIENT PARAMETRIC VARIATIONS OF THE KEY ASPECTS, AN EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTAL STUDY TO EXPLORE THE DYNAMIC SOIL STRUCTURE INTERACTION PROBLEM IN THE SMALL AMPLITUDE REGIME IS DESCRIBED. THROUGH A COMPARISON OF THE GENERATED DATA WITH THOSE FROM SEQUENTIAL VERTICAL CENTRIC AND HORIZONTAL LOAD TESTS, A NOVEL HYBRID MODE TEST CONCEPT BY WAY OF ECCENTRIC EXCITATIONS IS SUBSTANTIATED IN TERMS OF ITS ECONOMY AND EFFICIENCY IN CAPTURING THE FORCE RESPONSE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SYSTEM. SYNTHESISED IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN FOR DIRECT QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE INSIGHTS, MULTIPLE FORCED RESPONSE RECORDS OF THE FOUNDATION MODELS ON SAND SUBJECTED TO RANDOM VERTICAL, HORIZONTAL AND ROCKING EXCITATIONS ARE SUMMARISED. AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE ENGINEERING RELEVANCE OF THE EXPERIMENTAL DATABASE, A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF THE COMMONLY USED HOMOGENEOUS HALF SPACE DYNAMIC FOUNDATION SOLUTION PERTAINING TO COHESIONLESS SOILS IS ALSO PROVIDED.

BY INVOKING DARCYS LAW OVER THE FINITE TIME REQUIRED FOR AN INCREMENT OF CONE PENETRATION, IT ISARGUED THAT THERE WILL BE SOME WATER MOVEMENT THROUGH THE SOIL AROUND THE CONE, ALBEIT VERY SMALL IF THE SOIL IS VERY FINE GRAINED. BASED ON THIS ARGUMENT, AND NOTING THE COMPREHENSIVE TEST DATA COLLECTED PREVIOUSLY BY ELSWORTH &AMP; LEE, A BI LINEAR RELATION BETWEEN THE DIMENSIONLESS PIEZOCONE SOUNDING METRIC B QQ T AND THE DIMENSIONLESS HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY INDEX KD PLOTTED ON DOUBLE LOGARITHMIC SCALES HAS BEEN PROPOSED FOR SOILS RANGING FROM SANDS TO CLAYS. IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT THESE REVISED RELATIONSHIPS CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE PLAUSIBLE VALUES OF HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY FROM PIEZOCONE SOUNDING RECORDS TAKEN AT TWO DIFFERENT CLAY SOIL SITES IN SAGA AND YOKOHAMA, JAPAN. THE MAJOR SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS WORK IS IN EXTENDING THE RANGE OF APPLICATION OF THE METHOD FIRST PROPOSED BY ELSWORTH &AMP; LEE FOR SANDS TO ALMOST ALL SOIL TYPES. THIS WAS POSSIBLE AFTER APPROPRIATE MODIFICATION OF ELSWORTH AND LEES ORIGINAL METHOD.

THE DESIGN PROCESS IS FORMULATED AS AN EXPANDED RELIABILITY PROBLEM THAT IS EVALUATED BY A SINGLE RUN OF MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS (MCS). DESIGN PARAMETERS (I.E. FOUNDATION WIDTH B, LENGTH L AND DEPTH D) ARE ARTIFICIALLY TREATED AS DISCRETE UNIFORM RANDOM VARIABLES, AND THE DESIGN PROCESS IS CONSIDERED AS A PROCESS OF FINDING FAILURE PROBABILITIES FOR DESIGNS WITH VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF B, L AND D (I.E. CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY P(FAILURE{PIPE}B,L,D)) AND COMPARING THEM WITH TARGET PROBABILITY OF FAILURE PT. FEASIBLE DESIGNS ARE THOSE WITH P(FAILURE{PIPE}B,L,D) < PT, AND THE FEASIBLE DESIGN WITH THE MINIMUM CONSTRUCTION COST IS SELECTED AS THE FINAL DESIGN. EQUATIONS ARE DERIVED FOR THIS EXPANDED RELIABILITY BASED DESIGN (RBDE) APPROACH AND CRITERIA ARE ESTABLISHED FOR THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF MCS SAMPLES TO ENSURE A DESIRED LEVEL OF ACCURACY. THE RBDE APPROACH WITH MCS IS ILLUSTRATED THROUGH A DESIGN EXAMPLE OF A SQUARE SPREAD FOUNDATION WITH A FIXED DEPTH THAT HAS BEEN USED FOR THE EVALUATION OF EUROCODE 7. THE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE FROM PREVIOUS RELIABILITY ANALYSIS REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE. IN ADDITION, THE RBDE APPROACH WITH MCS OFFERS DESIGN ENGINEERS INSIGHTS INTO HOW THE EXPECTED PERFORMANCE LEVEL OF SPREAD FOUNDATIONS CHANGES AS B, L AND D CHANGE, AND IT ALLOWS DESIGN ENGINEERS TO ADJUST PT, WITHOUT ADDITIONAL COMPUTATIONAL EFFORTS, TO CATER FOR THE NEEDS OF PARTICULAR PROJECTS. IT ALSO PROVIDES DESIGN ENGINEERS WITH FLEXIBILITY IN MODELING THE UNCERTAINTIES AND SELECTING PROPER DETERMINISTIC ULS AND SLS CALCULATION MODELS.

IN THIS PAPER, A WORLDWIDE HIGH QUALITY DATABASE (THREE ONSHORE SITES AND SEVEN OFFSHORE SITES) WAS USED TO IDENTIFY SOIL CHARACTERISTICS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE RELATIVE MAGNITUDES OF PENETRATION RESISTANCE MEASURED WITH CONE, T BAR AND BALL PENETROMETERS. FOR SOILS COVERED IN THIS DATABASE, THE RATIO OF T BAR TO NET CONE PENETRATION RESISTANCE (Q T BAR/Q NET) LAY BETWEEN 0.75 AND 1, DECREASING WITH DEPTH FROM NEAR UNITY AT SHALLOW DEPTHS. FOR THE FOUR SITES WHERE BALL PENETROMETER DATA WERE AVAILABLE, THE RATIO OF BALL TO T BAR PENETRATION RESISTANCE (Q BALL/Q T BAR) WAS FOUND TO FLUCTUATE AROUND UNITY, WITH AN AVERAGE JUST GREATER THAN 1, BUT NO DISTINGUISHABLE TREND WITH DEPTH. THE MEASURED Q T BAR/Q NET AND Q BALL/Q NET FOLLOWED THEORETICAL TRENDS FOR THE CONE RESISTANCE TO INCREASE WITH RIGIDITY INDEX, G/S U, WITH THE BEST QUANTITATIVE AGREEMENT OBTAINED USING A RIGIDITY INDEX DEFINED IN TERMS OF THE SMALL STRAIN STIFFNESS, G 0, AS MEASURED BY IN SITU SEISMIC CONE TESTS. THE RESISTANCE RATIO ALSO FOLLOWED THE THEORETICAL TREND PREDICTED WITH CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE EFFECTS OF STRENGTH ANISOTROPY. HOWEVER, WHILE Q T BAR/Q NET AND POSSIBLY QBALL/QNET APPEAR TO DEPEND SLIGHTLY ON THE LIQUIDITY INDEX, LIQUID LIMIT AND PLASTICITY INDEX, THE RESISTANCE RATIOS APPEARED INDEPENDENT OF OTHER SOIL PARAMETERS, INCLUDING NORMALISED IN SITU SHEAR STRESS, SENSITIVITY AND YIELD STRESS RATIO, FOR THE SOILS COVERED IN THIS STUDY.

MOST PREVIOUS SOLUTIONS FOR GRANULAR SOILS WERE BASED EITHER ON A STRAIGHT (C, FI) ENVELOPE OR SIMPLY ON A CONSTANT ANGLE OF SHEARING, FI. FOR GRANULAR SOILS, SEC FI USUALLY VARIES LINEARLY WITH THE LOGARITHM OF MEAN EFFECTIVE STRESS. A NEW METHOD OF CALCULATION PERMITS FI TO VARY THROUGHOUT THE STRESS FIELD AS AN ARBITRARY (OR EMPIRICAL) FUNCTION OF STRESS. THIS METHOD IS VERIFIED FOR BOTH PLANE STRAIN AND AXISYMMETRIC CONDITIONS BY FORCING A VARIATION IN SEC FI EQUIVALENT TO GENERATING A CONSTANT COHESION ENVELOPE, FOR WHICH SOLUTIONS ALREADY EXIST. THE VARIABLE FI ANALYSIS IS USED TO DEMONSTRATE THE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF STRESS VARIATION AROUND AND BENEATH A FOOTING. FINALLY, IT IS SHOWN THAT AN EQUIVALENT CONSTANT VALUE FI M CAN BE DERIVED EMPIRICALLY, USING THE NEW SOLUTIONS TO IDENTIFY AN EQUIVALENT MEAN EFFECTIVE STRESS PM. HOWEVER, ONLY THE VARIABLE FI SOLUTION CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY CAPTURE THE BEARING CAPACITY AND THE GEOMETRY OF THE BEARING MECHANISM.

BASED ON EVALUATION OF NUMEROUS STRAIN STRAIN CURVES OBTAINED FROM TRIAXIAL COMPRESSION TESTING OF SAMPLES OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE (MSW) RANGING FROM FRESH TO DEGRADED, IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE STRESS STRAIN BEHAVIOUR OF MSW UNDER LOADING FOLLOWS A NON LINEAR ELASTIC (HYPERBOLIC) MODEL. THE HYPERBOLIC MODEL IS TYPICALLY DESCRIBED USING SIGMA ULT AND E, BUT CAN ALSO BE DESCRIBED USING C AND O IN CONJUNCTION WITH THREE OTHER PARAMETERS (K, N AND R F). THE USE OF THE PARAMETERS K, N AND R F TO DESCRIBE THE STRESS STRAIN BEHAVIOUR MAY BE PARTICULARLY USEFUL FOR MSW, BECAUSE IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN VALUES OF SIGMA ULT AND E. STRESS STRAIN DATA FROM 15 DATASETS COMPRISING 57 INDIVIDUAL TRIAXIAL TESTS HAVE BEEN COMPILED. THESE DATA ORIGINATED BOTH FROM PUBLISHED STUDIES AND FROM THE AUTHORS OWN LABORATORY TESTING OF LARGE INTACT AND RECOMPACTED SAMPLES OF MSW FROM THREE DIFFERENT LANDFILLS IN CANADA. BEST FIT HYPERBOLIC MODEL PARAMETERS K, N AND R F WERE DETERMINED FOR 12 OF THESE DATASETS (COMPRISING 50 INDIVIDUAL TRIAXIAL TESTS), AND UPPER AND LOWER BOUND VALUES OF K, N AND R F WERE DETERMINED FOR THE 90% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. BY USING THESE UPPER AND LOWER BOUND VALUES, THE FIVE PARAMETER HYPERBOLIC MODEL WAS EFFECTIVELY REDUCED TO A TWO PARAMETER (C O) MODEL. IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE RESULTING LOWER AND UPPER BOUNDS OF THE STRESS STRAIN CURVES PLOTTED USING THE PROPOSED LOWER AND UPPER BOUNDS OF K, N AND R F IN CONJUNCTION WITH SITE SPECIFIC C O VALUES CAN REASONABLY EMBRACE THE EXPERIMENTAL STRAIN STRAIN CURVES UP TO AN AXIAL STRAIN OF 20%, EVEN GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY OF THE WASTE SAMPLES CONSIDERED. THIS APPROACH IS GIVEN FURTHER CREDENCE AS IT YIELDS A REASONABLE PREDICTION OF THE STRESS STRAIN BEHAVIOUR WHEN COMPARED WITH THE LAST THREE DATASETS (COMPRISING SEVEN INDIVIDUAL TRIAXIAL TESTS), WHICH HAD NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS.

SIMULTANEOUSLY, TECHNIQUES FOR OBSERVING DISPLACEMENT FIELDS CAN BE USED TO PRODUCE INFORMATION ABOUT INTERNAL STRAINS. THE COMBINATION OF PHOTOELASTIC AND PHOTOGRAPHIC OBSERVATION HAS POTENTIAL FOR EXTENDING KNOWLEDGE OF INTERNAL CONDITIONS IN TWODIMENSIONAL SAMPLES OF GRANULAR MATERIAL. THE PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN THIS NOTE INDICATE SOME INTERESTING POSSIBILITIES FOR EXPERIMENTAL SOIL MECHANICS. THE USE OF DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY WITH POLARISED LIGHT PERMITS INCREMENTAL RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED FROM THE PHOTOELASTIC IMAGES. THE USE OF DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY IN NON POLARISED LIGHT WITH PARTICLE IMAGE VELOCIMETRY ANALYSIS GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN EXPERIMENTAL DISPLACEMENT AND STRAIN FIELDS WITH GREAT ACCURACY AND LOCAL DETAIL. THE USE OF STANDARD IMAGE PROCESSING AND GRAPHICS SOFTWARE PERMITS PRECISE COMPARISON OF FEATURES OF THE INCREMENTAL STRAIN AND STRESS FIELDS BY SUPERIMPOSING CORRESPONDING IMAGES.

THIS PAPER REPORTS ON SOME INTERESTING FINDINGS OBTAINED FROM A LABORATORY BASED MODEL STUDY IN RESPECT OF THIS ISSUE. THE MODEL TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT ON SAMPLES OF SOFT CLAY, 300 MM IN DIAMETER AND 400 MM HIGH. THE SAMPLES WERE REINFORCED WITH FULLY PENETRATING STONE COLUMNS, OF THREE DIFFERENT DIAMETERS, MADE OF CRUSHED BASALT. FOUR PRESSURE CELLS WERE LOCATED ALONG EACH STONE COLUMN. THE 60 MM DIAMETER FOOTING USED IN THE MODEL WAS SUPPORTED ON A CLAY BED REINFORCED WITH A STONE COLUMN AND SUBJECTED TO FOUNDATION LOADING UNDER DRAINED CONDITIONS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE DISSIPATION OF EXCESS PORE WATER PRESSURE DEVELOPED DURING THE INITIAL APPLICATION OF TOTAL STRESSES, WHEN THE FOUNDATION WAS SUBJECTED TO NO LOADING, GENERATED CONSIDERABLE STRESSES WITHIN THE COLUMN, AND THAT THIS WAS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEGATIVE SKIN FRICTION. THE PRESSURE DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE COLUMN DURING FOUNDATION LOADING SHOWED SOME COMPLEX BEHAVIOUR.

THE MODEL IS CALIBRATED USING LABORATORY TEST RESULTS FOR THE EMBANKMENT MATERIAL AND THE FOUNDATION SOILS. THE INITIAL STATE VARIABLES (STRESS, HARDENING PARAMETERS) ARE DETERMINED BY SIMULATING A SIMPLIFIED GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE FOUNDATION SOIL, DAM CONSTRUCTION STAGES AND RESERVOIR IMPOUNDING, PRIOR TO THE APPLICATION OF THE EARTHQUAKE SHAKING AT THE BEDROCK LEVEL. THE PAPER CRITICALLY REVIEWS THE ROLE OF THE CONSTITUTIVE MODEL PARAMETERS, THE HYSTERETIC DAMPING INTRODUCED BY THE MODEL AND THE ADDITIONAL VISCOUS DAMPING PARAMETERS IN THE ACCUMULATION OF PERMANENT DISPLACEMENTS AND IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUBSEQUENT DISSIPATION OF EXCESS PORE WATER PRESSURES DUE TO THE SEISMIC LOADING. THE ANALYSES, CARRIED OUT WITH REFERENCE TO A SET OF EARTHQUAKE RECORDS RELATED TO DIFFERENT RETURN PERIODS, SHOW THAT THE OVERALL BEHAVIOUR OF THE SYSTEM IN TERMS OF DISPLACEMENTS IS CHARACTERISED BY A MORE ENHANCED DEFORMATION PATTERN OF THE DOWNSTREAM SLOPE AS COMPARED WITH THE UPSTREAM ONE. THE LARGE PLASTIC STRAINS ACCUMULATION INDUCED THROUGHOUT THE SHAKING IS FOLLOWED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXCESS PORE WATER PRESSURES INSIDE THE DAM AND THE FOUNDATION DEPOSIT. NONETHELESS, THE RESULTS ARE INDICATIVE OF A SATISFACTORY DYNAMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE DAM, EVEN WHEN SUBJECTED TO SEVERE SEISMIC LOADING CONDITIONS.

IN TWO EXTENSIVE CHARACTERISATION STUDIES, A WIDE RANGE OF IN SITU TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT AT THE BURSWOOD SITE, INCLUDING FULL FLOW PENETROMETER TESTS (T BAR, BALL AND PLATE). IN ADDITION, THIN WALL TUBE SAMPLES AND HIGH QUALITY SHERBROOKE BLOCK SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FOR LABORATORY TESTING. THE STRESS STRAIN STRENGTH, CONSOLIDATION AND COMPRESSIBILITY CHARACTERISTICS OF BURSWOOD CLAY WERE INVESTIGATED, AND THE PERFORMANCE OF VARIOUS PENETROMETERS IN CHARACTERISING THE SOFT BURSWOOD CLAY WAS ASSESSED. THE PAPER COMPARES VALUES OF STIFFNESS AND SHEAR STRENGTH MEASURED BY DIFFERENT IN SITU AND LABORATORY TESTS, QUANTIFYING THE DEGREE OF NON LINEARITY OF THE STRESS STRAIN RESPONSE, THE EFFECT OF SAMPLE DISTURBANCE ON THE MEASURED MECHANICAL PROPERTIES, THE DEGREE OF STRENGTH ANISOTROPY, AND THE INFLUENCE OF STRAIN RATE ON THE MEASURED SHEAR STRENGTH. IN ADDITION, FACTORS RELATING THE NET PENETRATION RESISTANCE MEASURED BY CONE, T BAR AND BALL PENETROMETERS TO YIELD STRESS, SMALL STRAIN SHEAR MODULUS AND DIFFERENT MEASURES OF UNDRAINED SHEAR STRENGTH ARE ALSO PROVIDED.

HOWEVER, SLOPE INSTABILITY IS OFTEN ACCOMPANIED BY DISCONTINUOUS FAILURE OF THE SOIL, WHICH CANNOT BE MODELLED BY EITHER LEMS OR FEM. TO OVERCOME THIS LIMITATION, THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN EXTENSION OF THE SMOOTHED PARTICLE HYDRODYNAMICS (SPH) METHOD TO EVALUATE THE STABILITY OF A SLOPE, AND TO SIMULATE THE POST FAILURE BEHAVIOUR OF SOIL. FOR THE SLOPE STABILITY ANALYSIS, THE SHEAR STRENGTH REDUCTION TECHNIQUE WITH A MODIFIED FAILURE CRITERION FOR DISTINGUISHING CONVERGENT FROM NON CONVERGENT SOLUTIONS IS APPLIED TO ESTIMATE THE SAFETY FACTOR OF A SLOPE, AND THE CRITICAL SLIP SURFACE IS DETERMINED FROM A CONTOUR PLOT OF ACCUMULATED PLASTIC STRAIN. TO TAKE THE PORE WATER PRESSURE INTO ACCOUNT, A NEW SPH FORMULATION FOR SOIL MOTION IS DEVELOPED. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THIS EQUATION CAN BE APPLIED TO FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS OF SPH FOR SATURATED SOIL. AS AN APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED METHOD, SEVERAL SMOOTHED PARTICLE SLOPE STABILITY ANALYSES AND CORRESPONDING SLOPE FAILURE SIMULATIONS ARE PRESENTED, AND COMPARED WITH OTHER SOLUTIONS. THE RESULTS SHOW GOOD AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER METHODS IN TERMS OF THE SAFETY FACTOR AND THE CRITICAL SLIP SURFACE. AS COMPARED WITH SUCH TRADITIONAL METHODS, HOWEVER, AN ADVANTAGE OF SPH IS THAT IT CAN SIMULATE LARGE DEFORMATION AND POST FAILURE OF SOIL, AND CAN THEREBY TREAT A WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS IN COMPUTATIONAL GEOMECHANICS, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT INCLUDE LARGE DEFORMATION AND FAILURE OF GEOMATERIALS.

HOWEVER, THERE REMAINS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY ON HOW THE INCREASE IN LATERAL STRESS THAT ARISES DUE TO CYCLING OF THE BACKFILL MAY BE ASSESSED FOR ABUTMENT DESIGN. SUCH UNCERTAINTY IS ADDRESSED IN THIS PAPER BY DRAWING ON RESULTS FROM A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS PERFORMED USING THE UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA (UWA) BEAM CENTRIFUGE. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHED LIGHT ON THE EFFECTS, FOR GRANULAR BACKFILL, OF INITIAL DENSITY, RETAINED HEIGHT, CYCLIC HISTORY AND PARTICLE SHAPE. THESE RESULTS, AS WELL AS OBSERVATIONS MADE FROM TESTS INVOLVING OVERCONSOLIDATED CLAYS, ARE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE EXISTING DATABASE OF LATERAL STRESS MEASUREMENTS TO ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ASSESSMENT OF DESIGN LATERAL STRESSES ON DEEP INTEGRAL BRIDGE ABUTMENTS.

IT IS, HOWEVER, POINTED OUT THAT THE EXTENSIVE EXPLOITATION OF GRAVELLY SOIL IS RARELY SUPPORTED BY A THOROUGH ANALYTICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPACTION EFFECTS ON THE CONSTITUTIVE RELATIONSHIPS OF MATERIALS, AS WOULD BE DESIRABLE CONSIDERING THE MASSIVE DIMENSION OF THESE WORKS AND THE COMPLEXITY OF TYPICAL LOADING CONDITIONS. THE PRESENT RESEARCH AIMS TO FILL THIS GAP BY MEANS OF A DETAILED EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION AND A THEORETICAL ANALYSIS ON THE STRESS STRAIN RESPONSE OF DENSE GRAVELS UNDER MONOTONIC AND CYCLIC LOADING. THE EXPERIMENTAL CAMPAIGN CONSISTS OF A LARGE NUMBER OF TRIAXIAL TESTS PERFORMED AT DIFFERENT INITIAL MEAN EFFECTIVE STRESSES, FOLLOWING DIFFERENT STRESS PATHS AND SEQUENCES, ON ARTIFICIALLY RECONSTITUTED SAMPLES OF LARGE DIMENSIONS COMPACTED AT DIFFERENT INITIAL DENSITIES. THE GREAT CARE PLACED IN THE ACCURACY OF LABORATORY INSTRUMENTATION ENABLES A HIGH REPEATABILITY OF EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS, WHICH IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE A CLEAR FOCUS ON NON LINEARITY IN THE LIMITED STRAIN RANGE OF THE PRE FAILURE RESPONSE OF THE GRAVEL. BASED ON THE CURVE FITTING METHOD THE INGREDIENTS OF AN ELASTO PLASTIC CONSTITUTIVE MODEL HAVE BEEN DEFINED TO PREDICT THE RESPONSE OF GRAVEL UNDER MONOTONIC AND CYCLIC LOADING. ELASTIC STIFFNESS IS SIMULATED WITH A MODEL DERIVED FROM THE LITERATURE WHICH ASSUMES A DEPENDENCY ON SOIL DENSITY TOGETHER WITH INHERENT AND STRESS INDUCED ANISOTROPY. PLASTIC STRAIN DEVELOPMENT FROM DIFFERENT INITIAL STRESS AND VOLUME STATES OF GRAVEL IS SIMULATED BY A CRITICAL STATE, MULTIPLE YIELDING CONSTITUTIVE MODEL. HARDENING AND FLOW RULES FOR THE LATTER HAVE BEEN OBTAINED BY MODIFYING PREVIOUSLY EXISTING LAWS IN ORDER BETTER TO REPRODUCE THE OBSERVATIONS UNDER MONOTONIC COMPRESSION, EXTENSION AND CYCLIC LOADING. VALIDATION OF THE PROPOSED MODEL IS FINALLY PROVIDED BY COMPARING SIMULATIONS AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS IN A VARIETY OF TESTING CONDITIONS.

CHEMICAL ANALYSES ON THE SURNATANT AND ANALYSES ON X RAY DIFFRACTION PATTERNS, HIGH TEMPERATURE DIFFERENTIAL SCANNING CALORIMETRY THERMAL GRAVIMETRY SCANS AND TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY MICROGRAPHS LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE BULK OF KAOLINITE MINERAL IS PROBABLY ONLY SLIGHTLY AFFECTED BY THE CHEMICAL INTERACTIONS, THE CHEMICAL ATTACK BEING CONCENTRATED MAINLY AT THE PARTICLE EDGES, WHERE IT INDUCES A CHANGE IN THE SHAPE OF THE EDGES, WHICH BECOME IRREGULAR AND LESS SHARP. THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF KAOLINITE IS NOT AFFECTED BY PORE FLUID SALINITY, BUT IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY PORE FLUID PH: BOTH ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS UNDER AN APPLIED STRESS CAUSE SIGNIFICANT VOLUMETRIC COMPRESSION. SUCH STRAINS ARE IRREVERSIBLE AND PROBABLY RELATED TO THE PARTICLE REARRANGEMENT INDUCED MAINLY BY THE DEGRADATION OF THE PARTICLE EDGES, IN ADDITION TO THE DECREASE IN BASAL FRICTION ANGLE (DESCRIBED IN THE COMPANION PAPER) AND THE CHANGE OF STRENGTH AT EDGE TO FACE CONTACT POINTS. THE MECHANICAL EFFECTS ARE SLIGHTLY RELATED TO THE DIELECTRIC CONSTANT OF THE PORE FLUID AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL CONVICTION THAT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN KAOLINITE PARTICLES ARE MOSTLY MECHANICAL.

ALTHOUGH PARTICLE BREAKAGE IS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TENSILE STRENGTH OF A SINGLE SOIL GRAIN, INITIAL DENSITY AND INITIAL SAMPLE GRADING HAVE GREAT INFLUENCE ON THE PROBABILITY OF PARTICLE BREAKAGE. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE EFFECT OF INITIAL GRADING AND DENSITY ON THE SAMPLE BEHAVIOUR DURING ONE DIMENSIONAL COMPRESSION FOR THREE SANDS WITH DISTINCT MINERALOGIES. IT WAS FOUND THAT A UNIQUE NORMAL COMPRESSION LINE IS THE OUTCOME OF A LARGE AMOUNT OF BREAKAGE IN POORLY GRADED SAMPLES AND THAT BY CHANGING THE INITIAL GRADING TO A BETTER GRADED SAMPLE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PARTICLE BREAKAGE IS OBSERVED, UNTIL FOR VERY WELL GRADED SAMPLES NO SIGNIFICANT PARTICLE BREAKAGE CAN BE MEASURED. AT THIS POINT A DIFFICULTY IN DEFINING A UNIQUE NORMAL COMPRESSION LINE FOR THE SAMPLE WAS FOUND AND A TRANSITIONAL BEHAVIOUR WAS IDENTIFIED. IN ADDITION TO PARTICLE SIZE, THE PAPER EXAMINES THE CHANGES TO SOME IMPORTANT PARTICLE CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS PARTICLE SHAPE AND PARTICLE SURFACE ROUGHNESS IN AN ATTEMPT TO RELATE THE SOIL BEHAVIOUR TO THE NATURE OF THE MICROSCOPIC PARTICLE DAMAGE DURING YIELDING.

THE CHAMBER WAS THEN FILLED WITH A SCALED GRANULAR EQUIVALENT OF TICINO SAND, THE MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF WHICH WERE SELECTED BY CURVE FITTING TRIAXIAL TESTS. CONE PENETRATION TESTS WERE THEN PERFORMED UNDER DIFFERENT INITIAL DENSITIES AND ISOTROPIC STRESSES. PENETRATION RESISTANCE IN THE VIRTUAL CALIBRATION CHAMBER WAS AFFECTED BY THE SAME CONE/CHAMBER SIZE EFFECT THAT AFFECTS PHYSICAL CALIBRATION CHAMBERS AND WAS CORRECTED ACCORDINGLY. THE CORRECTED CONE RESISTANCE OBTAINED FROM THE VIRTUAL CALIBRATION CHAMBER CONE PENETRATION TESTS SHOWS GOOD QUANTITATIVE AGREEMENT WITH CORRELATIONS THAT SUMMARISE PREVIOUS PHYSICAL RESULTS.

TALLAVO F., CASCANTE G., PANDEY M.D.	ULTRASONIC TRANSDUCERS CHARACTERISATION FOR EVALUATION OF STIFF GEOMATERIALS	2011	GEOTECHNIQUE	61	6		501	510		2	HTTP://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URL?EID2 S2.0 79955919334&PARTNERID40&MD575B286F6DB4543A3CFD10E61E990DBCC	UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO, CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT, WATERLOO, CANADA	TALLAVO, F., UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO, CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT, WATERLOO, CANADA; CASCANTE, G., UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO, CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT, WATERLOO, CANADA; PANDEY, M.D., UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO, CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT, WATERLOO, CANADA	THE PULSE VELOCITY TEST (PVT) IS AN ASTM STANDARD FOR THE DYNAMIC CHARACTERISATION OF GEOMATERIALS SUCH AS STIFF CLAYS, CEMENTED SANDS, ROOKS AND CONCRETE. THE PVT IS BASED ON THE FIRST ARRIVAL OF THE COMPRESSIONAL WAVE. THE ANALYSIS OF FULL WAVEFORMS IN ULTRASONIC TESTING IS IMPORTANT IN EVALUATING THE VARIATION WITH FREQUENCY OF THE DYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS (PHASE VELOCITY AND MATERIAL DAMPING). RELIABLE FULL WAVEFORMS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO CALIBRATE NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF ULTRASONIC WAVE PROPAGATION IN VISCOELASTIC MATERIALS. HOWEVER, THE ANALYSIS OF FULL WAVEFORMS IS RARELY PERFORMED IN PRACTICE BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN THE CHARACTERISATION OF ULTRASONIC TRANSDUCERS AND THEIR COUPLING WITH THE MEDIUM. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A NEW METHODOLOGY FOR MEASUREMENT OF THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE AND IMPULSE RESPONSE FUNCTIONS OF ULTRASONIC TRANSDUCERS. THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY USES THE COMPLEX EXPONENTIAL METHOD TO EXTRACT DYNAMIC PROPERTIES FROM IMPULSE RESPONSE FUNCTIONS. ULTRASONIC TESTS AND NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS ARE CONDUCTED ON A CALIBRATION ALUMINIUM BAR AND A CEMENTED SAND SPECIMEN TO DEMONSTRATE THE APPLICABILITY OF THE NEW METHODOLOGY. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THIS METHODOLOGY CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY USED FOR DYNAMIC CHARACTERIZATION OF ULTRASONIC TRANSDUCERS FOR EVALUATION OF THE WAVE VELOCITY AND DAMPING RATIO OF STIFF GEOMATERIALS.

IN PARTICULAR, THE EFFECTS OF THE DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS ON THE LIQUID LIMIT, ONE DIMENSIONAL COMPRESSIBILITY, PERMEABILITY AND RESIDUAL SHEAR STRENGTH ARE CONSIDERED. KAOLINITE PROVES RELATIVELY INSENSITIVE TO SALT SOLUTIONS, WHEREAS VARIATIONS IN PORE FLUID PH CAUSE LARGE STRENGTH CHANGES, ASSOCIATED WITH NON NEGLIGIBLE CHANGES IN ONE DIMENSIONAL COMPRESSIBILITY. THE PARTLY INCONSISTENT EFFECTS INDUCED BY ACIDS AND BASES ON THE RESIDUAL SHEAR STRENGTH AND ON THE ONEDIMENSIONAL COMPRESSIBILITY DO NOT PERMIT ANY EASY INTERPRETATION OF THE EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE. MINERAL DISSOLUTION AND THE ASSOCIATED FORMATION OF NEW COMPOUNDS ARE PROBABLY INVOLVED IN THE BEHAVIOUR OBSERVED. THESE ASPECTS WILL BE INVESTIGATED IN PART 2 OF THIS PAPER.

IN THIS STUDY, SDSWCCS AND THE PERMEABILITY FUNCTION WERE MEASURED BY USING THE INSTANTANEOUS PROFILE METHOD ON A SAPROLITICHILLSIDE IN TUNG CHUNG, HONG KONG. THE GROUND PROFILE COMPRISES COLLUVIUM AND COMPLETELY DECOMPOSED TUFF (CDT). A 3 M DIAMETER CIRCULAR PLOT WAS INSTRUMENTED AND SUBJECTED TO TWO WETTING DRYING CYCLES. THROUGHOUT A 48 DAY MONITORING PERIOD, VARIATIONS OF VOLUMETRIC WATER CONTENT AND MATRIX SUCTION IN THE UPPERMOST 3 M OF SOIL WERE MEASURED CONTINUOUSLY USING TIME DOMAIN REFLECTOMETRY MOISTURE PROBES AND JET FILL TENSIOMETERS, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIELD OBSERVATIONS REVEAL THAT THERE IS A CLEAR TREND OF DECREASING SIZES OF HYSTERETIC LOOPS OF SDSWCCS WITH DEPTH. IN A COMPARISON OF THE FIELD AND LABORATORY MEASURED SDSWCCS, GENERAL AGREEMENT CAN BE SEEN IN THE FIRST WETTING DRYING CYCLE BUT NOT IN THE SECOND CYCLE. THE FIELD OBSERVED UNSATURATED PERMEABILITY FUNCTION IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON SUCTION HISTORY (WETTING DRYING CYCLES). THE FIELD MEASURED PERMEABILITY RANGES FROM 4 X 10 7 M/S TO 3 X 104 M/S IN THE COLLUVIUM, WHEREAS THE CORRESPONDING MEASURED VALUES VARY FROM 4 X 10 7 M/S TO 1 X 104 M/S IN THE CDT. PREDICTIONS OF SWCC AND PERMEABILITY FUNCTION USING EXISTING EMPIRICAL APPROACHES BASED ON PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS (PSDS) SHOULD BE TREATED WITH CAUTION. THERE IS A CLEAR QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN PREDICTIONS OF PERMEABILITY FUNCTION FROM PSD AND FIELD MEASUREMENTS.

THE AIMS OF THE STUDY WERE TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF PLASTIC HINGING ON EMBEDDED RETAINING WALL RESPONSE, AND TO VERIFY CALCULATION METHODS FOR USE IN WIDER GENERIC CALCULATIONS. PHYSICAL MODELLING OF AN ANCHORED WALL EMBEDDED IN DRY SAND WAS UNDERTAKEN. IN SOME OF THE TESTS A HINGE ZONE WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE WALL IN ORDER TO REPRODUCE A KINEMATIC MECHANISM SIMILAR TO THAT ASSOCIATED WITH PLASTIC HINGE FORMATION. FINITE ELEMENT CALCULATIONS WERE UNDERTAKEN USING LADES DOUBLE HARDENING CAP MODEL TO REPRESENT THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE SAND. THE ANALYSES GENERALLY YIELDED GOOD ACCORD WITH THE TEST RESULTS IN MANY ASPECTS OF THE WALL BEHAVIOUR. IN TERMS OF THE AIMS OF THE TESTING, THE STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF PLASTIC HINGING WAS NOT REALISTICALLY CAPTURED, BECAUSE THE HINGE ZONE WAS PRESENT FROM THE OUTSET OF THE TEST, ALLOWING GREATER THAN EXPECTED EARTH PRESSURE REDISTRIBUTION, AND BECAUSE THE MOMENT CURVATURE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE NOTCHED WALL DID NOT REPRODUCE THE BUCKLING EFFECTS SEEN IN THE PLASTIC BENDING RESPONSE OF STEEL SHEET PILES. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE SATISFACTORY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TEST OBSERVATIONS AND THE NUMERICAL PREDICTIONS GAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE USE OF THE CALCULATION MODEL FOR FURTHER GENERIC CALCULATIONS USING REALISTIC STEEL SHEET PILE MOMENT PLASTIC CURVATURE CHARACTERISTICS.

A RELATIVELY NARROW CENTRAL CLAY CORE IS STABILISED BY WIDE ROCKFILL SHOULDERS. THE DAM WAS WELL INSTRUMENTED AND CONTINUOUS RECORDS OF STRESS DEVELOPMENT, PORE WATER PRESSURES AND VERTICAL DISPLACEMENTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD. COMPACTION CONDITIONS WERE FOLLOWED BY MEANS OF LABORATORY AND IN SITU CONTROL TESTS. CORE CLAY MATERIAL WAS INVESTIGATED BY MEANS OF TESTS PERFORMED ON COMPACTED SPECIMENS OF TERTIARY CLAYS. ROCKFILL SAMPLES WERE EXCAVATED IN OUTCROPS OF HIGHLY FRACTURED CAMBRIAN QUARTZITIC SHALE. A TESTING PROGRAMME ON COMPACTED ROCKFILL GRAVELS WAS CONDUCTED UNDER RELATIVE HUMIDITY CONTROL IN A LARGE DIAMETER OEDOMETER AND TRIAXIAL CELLS. A COUPLED FINITE ELEMENT MODEL HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO ANALYSE THE TESTS PERFORMED AND DAM BEHAVIOUR DURING CONSTRUCTION. MODEL PREDICTIONS, ESSENTIALLY BASED ON LABORATORY TESTS, ARE COMPARED WITH MEASUREMENTS DURING CONSTRUCTION. THE PREDICTED RESPONSE OF THE DAM UNDER AN ASSUMED PROGRAMME OF IMPOUNDING IS ALSO GIVEN. IN THE FUTURE, ONCE IMPOUNDING OCCURS, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO COMPARE THESE PREDICTIONS WITH ACTUAL DAM PERFORMANCE. THE PAPER PROVIDES AN INTEGRATED DESCRIPTION OF THE DAM DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND EARLY BEHAVIOUR. IT PRESENTS A PROCEDURE TO INTERPRET AVAILABLE DATA (LABORATORY AS WELL AS IN SITU DATA) ON COMPACTED MATERIALS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF MODERN CONSTITUTIVE MODELS. IT ALSO PROVIDES AN EVALUATION OF THE CAPABILITIES OF ADVANCED NUMERICAL TOOLS TO REPRODUCE THE MEASURED DAM BEHAVIOUR.

SINGLE AND DOUBLE OEDOMETER TESTS ARE CARRIED OUT. A COMPARISON IS MADE BETWEEN LABORATORY TESTS AND GEOTECHNICAL CENTRIFUGE MODELLING AT 100G CONDUCTED TO EXAMINE AN INUNDATED EMBANKMENT MADE OF A SAND CLAY MIXTURE. A 20 CM HIGH EMBANKMENT MODEL IS BUILT AND INSTRUMENTED. THE MATERIAL IS COMPACTED ON THE DRY SIDE OF THE OPTIMUM PROCTOR CURVE AT A LOW COMPACTION RATE IN ORDER TO EMPHASISE SETTLEMENT PHENOMENA. THE INUNDATION SIMULATION IS CONDUCTED IN TWO SUCCESSIVE SEQUENCES DURING CENTRIFUGE FLIGHT UP TO A WATER TABLE OF 5 CM. THE RESULTS PROVE THAT THE PREDICTION OF THE DRY DENSITY AFTER SETTLEMENT DUE TO INUNDATION IS GOOD.

ONE OF THE MAIN ADVANTAGES OF THE USE OF POWDER/PELLETS MIXTURES IS THE REDUCTION OF THE COMPACTION EFFORT REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THE VALUE OF AVERAGE DRY DENSITY NECESSARY TO ATTAIN THE REQUIRED SWELLING POTENTIAL. HOWEVER, THE HETEROGENEOUS FABRIC OF THE MATERIAL REQUIRES SPECIAL APPROACHES IN ORDER TO DESCRIBE ADEQUATELY ITS BEHAVIOUR DURING HYDRATION. A DOUBLE POROSITY FORMULATION IS PRESENTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE PRESENCE OF TWO DISTINCT STRUCTURAL LEVELS IN THE MATERIAL. HYDRAULIC EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN THE TWO POROSITIES IS NOT ASSUMED; INSTEAD A WATER EXCHANGE TERM BETWEEN THEM IS POSTULATED. THE FORMULATION IS APPLIED TO THE MODELLING OF A NUMBER OF ONE DIMENSIONAL SWELLING PRESSURE TESTS PERFORMED IN THE CEA (COMMISARIAT A L ENERGIE ATOMIQUE, FRANCE) AND CIEMAT (SPAIN) LABORATORIES. A VERY SATISFACTORY QUANTITATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS IS OBTAINED THAT INCLUDES A NUMBER OF COMPLEX BEHAVIOUR FEATURES SUCH AS SIZE EFFECTS AND NONMONOTONIC DEVELOPMENT OF SWELLING PRESSURES. SOME MICROFABRIC OBSERVATIONS USING X RAY TOMOGRAPHY AND MERCURY INTRUSION POROSIMETRY LEND SUPPORT TO THE CONCEPTUAL APPROACH ADOPTED. THE FORMULATION IS THEN APPLIED TO THE ANALYSIS OF A LONG TERM LARGE SCALE SEALING TEST PERFORMED AT THE HADES UNDERGROUND FACILITY IN BELGIUM, USING THE SAME SET OF HYDRAULIC AND MECHANICAL PARAMETERS EMPLOYED IN THE MODELLING OF THE LABORATORY TESTS. ALTHOUGH THE FIELD OBSERVATIONS EXHIBIT A MUCH HIGHER DEGREE OF SCATTER, THE BASIC BEHAVIOUR OF THE FIELD SEALING TEST IS SATISFACTORILY SIMULATED. A FORMULATION THAT INCORPORATES BASIC FEATURES OF THE MICROFABRIC OF THE MIXTURE IS THUS ABLE TO SPAN SUCCESSFULLY OVER A LARGE RANGE OF SPACE AND TIME SCALES.

THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE INFLUENCE OF COMPACTION WATER CONTENT AND COMPACTION STRESS ON WETTING PATHS. COMPARING THE CHANGES IN DEGREE OF SATURATION INDUCED BY MECHANICAL LOADING AND HYDRAULIC LOADING (WETTING PATH UNDER NULL STRESS), IT MAY BE NOTICED THAT THE OEDOMETRIC PATH HAS AN OPPOSITE CURVE OF THAT OF THE WETTING PATH, DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE VOID RATIO DECREASES UNDER CONSTANT WATER CONTENT WHEN THE STRESS IS INCREASED IN ONE CASE (COMPRESSION) AND INCREASES WITH WATER CONTENT IN THE OTHER (SWELLING).

J., PONTS PARISTECH, UMR NAVIER/CERMES, PARIS, FRANCE	LIME TREATMENT IS A WELL KNOWN TECHNIQUE TO IMPROVE THE MECHANICAL RESPONSE OF CLAYEY SUBGRADES OF ROAD PAVEMENTS OR CLAYEY SOILS USED FOR EMBANKMENT. SEVERAL STUDIES SHOW THAT LIME TREATMENT SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFIES THE PHYSICAL AND HYDROMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF COMPACTED SOILS. NEVERTHELESS, STUDIES ON THE SCALE EFFECT UNDER CLIMATIC CHANGES ARE SCARCE. ACTUALLY, WETTING DRYING CYCLES MIGHT SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFY THE MICROSTRUCTURE OF TREATED SOILS, GIVING RISE TO CHANGES IN HYDROMECHANICAL PROPERTIES. THIS MODIFICATION COULD BE DEPENDENT ON THE SIZE OF SOIL AGGREGATES BEFORE LIME TREATMENT. IN THE PRESENT WORK, THIS SCALE EFFECT WAS STUDIED BY INVESTIGATING THE STIFFNESS OF A COMPACTED LIME TREATED CLAYEY SOIL USING BENDER ELEMENTS. THE STUDIED SOIL WAS FIRST AIR DRIED AND GROUND INTO A TARGET MAXIMUM SOIL AGGREGATES SIZE (DMAX). FOR EACH AGGREGATE SIZE, THE SOIL WAS HUMIDIFIED TO REACH THE TARGET WATER CONTENTS WI, THEN MIXED WITH 3% OF LIME POWDER (MASS OF LIME DIVIDED BY MASS OF DRIED SOIL) PRIOR TO THE STATIC COMPACTION AT A DRY DENSITY OF 1.60 MG/M3. TWO INITIAL WATER CONTENTS (WI 14 AND 18%) AND FOUR MAXIMUM SOIL AGGREGATES SIZES (DMAX 0.4, 1.0, 2.0 AND 5.0 MM) WERE CONSIDERED. AFTER THE COMPACTION, THE SOIL SPECIMEN (50 MM IN DIAMETER AND 50 MM HIGH) WAS COVERED BY PLASTIC FILM IN ORDER TO PREVENT SOIL MOISTURE CHANGES. THE SOIL STIFFNESS WAS THEN MONITORED AT VARIABLE TIME INTERVALS UNTIL REACHING STABILISATION. AFTERWARDS, THE SOIL SPECIMEN WAS SUBJECTED TO FULL SATURATION FOLLOWED BY AIR DRYING TO COME BACK TO ITS INITIAL WATER CONTENT. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT: (A) THE SOIL STIFFNESS AFTER LIME TREATMENT IS SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDENT ON THE AGGREGATE SIZE: THE FINER THE AGGREGATES THE HIGHER THE SOIL STIFFNESS; (B) THE EFFECT OF INITIAL WATER CONTENT ON THE STIFFNESS IS NEGLIGIBLE; AND (C) THE WETTING DRYING CYCLES SEEM TO SLIGHTLY INCREASE THE SOIL STIFFNESS IN THE CASE OF LIME TREATED SPECIMENS AND DECREASE THE SOIL STIFFNESS IN THE CASE OF UNTREATED SPECIMENS. FURTHERMORE, WHEN AN INTENSIVE DRYING WAS APPLIED REDUCING THE SOIL WATER CONTENT LOWER THAN THE INITIAL LEVEL, THE SOIL STIFFNESS DECREASED DRASTICALLY AFTER THE SUBSEQUENT WETTING.

FABRIC CHANGES ARE ANALYSED BOTH FROM THE POROUS NETWORK VIEWPOINT, BY MEANS OF CAREFUL MERCURY INTRUSION POROSIMETRY INVESTIGATION, AND FROM THE SOIL SKELETON VIEWPOINT, BY QUANTIFYING SWELLING AND SHRINKAGE OF THE AGGREGATES IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY STUDY. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE AGGREGATED FABRIC EVOLUTION ON THE WATER RETENTION PROPERTIES OF COMPACTED SOILS ARE ANALYSED AND DISCUSSED. A NEW MODEL FOR WATER RETENTION DOMAIN IS PROPOSED, WHICH INTRODUCES A DEPENDENCE OF THE INTRA AGGREGATE PORE VOLUME ON WATER CONTENT. THE MODEL SUCCEEDS IN TRACKING CORRECTLY THE EVOLUTION OF THE HYDRAULIC STATE OF THE DIFFERENT SOILS INVESTIGATED ALONG GENERALISED HYDROMECHANICAL PATHS. THE PROPOSED APPROACH BRINGS TO LIGHT COUPLING BETWEEN INTRA AGGREGATE AND INTER AGGREGATE PORES IN THE RETENTION PROPERTIES OF COMPACTED CLAYEY SOILS. DEPENDENCE OF THE AIR ENTRY AND THE AIR OCCLUSION VALUES ON SWELLING AND SHRINKING OF AGGREGATES, BESIDES VOID RATIO, IS INTRODUCED AND DISCUSSED.

A COMMON APPLICATION OF FILL MATERIALS IS THEIR USE AS BACKFILL IN MANY ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS, FOR EXAMPLE BEHIND A RETAINING WALL. THE POST CONSTRUCTION BEHAVIOUR OF CLAY FILLS IS COMPLEX WITH RESPECT TO STRESSES AND DEFORMATION WHEN THE FILLS BECOME SATURATED OVER TIME. HEAVILY COMPACTED FILLS SWELLS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THE LIGHTLY COMPACTED FILLS. THIS WILL PRODUCE ENHANCED LATERAL STRESSES IF THE FILL IS LATERALLY RESTRAINED. THE WORK PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER EXAMINES HOW THE STRESS REGIME IN UNSATURATED CLAY FILLS CHANGES WITH WETTING UNDER LATERALLY RESTRAINED CONDITIONS. SPECIMENS OF COMPACTED KAOLIN, WITH DIFFERENT INITIAL CONDITIONS, WERE WETTED TO VARIOUS VALUES OF SUCTION UNDER ZERO LATERAL STRAIN AT CONSTANT NET OVERBURDEN PRESSURE WHICH ALLOWED THE CONCEPT OF K0 (THE RATIO BETWEEN THE NET HORIZONTAL STRESS AND THE NET VERTICAL STRESS) TO BE EXAMINED. TESTS WERE ALSO CARRIED OUT TO EXAMINE THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPT OF THE EARTH PRESSURE COEFFICIENT AT REST UNDER LOADING AND UNLOADING AND ITS LIKELY EFFECTS ON THE STRESS STRAIN PROPERTIES. THE RESULTS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE STRESS REGIME (I.E. THE LATERAL STRESS) CHANGES SIGNIFICANTLY DURING WETTING UNDER LATERALLY RESTRAINED CONDITIONS. THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CHANGE IS AFFECTED BY THE INITIAL CONDITION OF THE SOIL. THE RESULTS HAVE ALSO INDICATED THAT THE EARTH PRESSURE COEFFICIENT AT REST DURING LOADING (UNDER THE NORMALLY CONSOLIDATED CONDITION) IS UNAFFECTED BY SUCTION AND SUCH LOADING CONDITIONS INEVITABLY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANISOTROPIC STRESS STRAIN PROPERTIES.

THE OBJECTIVE IS TO BENCHMARK DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO CONSTITUTIVE MODELLING OF MECHANICAL AND WATER RETENTION BEHAVIOUR OF UNSATURATED SOILS BY COMPARING SIMULATIONS OF SUCTION CONTROLLED AND CONSTANT WATER CONTENT LABORATORY TESTS. A SET OF 13 TRIAXIAL AND OEDOMETER LABORATORY TESTS, COVERING THE MECHANICAL AND WATER RETENTION BEHAVIOUR OF AN UNSATURATED COMPACTED SILTY SOIL UNDER A VARIETY OF STRESS PATHS, HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY ONE OF THE SEVEN PARTICIPATING TEAMS. THIS DATA SET HAS BEEN USED BY THE OTHER SIX TEAMS FOR CALIBRATING A CONSTITUTIVE MODEL OF THEIR CHOICE, WHICH HAS BEEN SUBSEQUENTLY EMPLOYED FOR PREDICTING STRAINS AND DEGREE OF SATURATION IN THREE OF THE 13 TESTS USED FOR CALIBRATION, AS WELL AS IN ONE BLIND TEST FOR WHICH EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS HAD NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED. BY COMPARING PREDICTIONS FROM ALL TEAMS AMONG THEMSELVES AND AGAINST EXPERIMENTAL DATA, THE WORK HIGHLIGHTS THE CAPABILITY OF SOME OF THE CURRENT MODELLING APPROACHES TO REPRODUCE SPECIFIC FEATURES OF THE MECHANICAL AND WATER RETENTION BEHAVIOUR OF UNSATURATED SOILS HELPING TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL AREAS OF WEAKNESS WHERE FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD FOCUS. IT ALSO DEMONSTRATES THE DISPERSION OF RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED WHEN DIFFERENT CONSTITUTIVE MODELS, INDEPENDENTLY CALIBRATED BY DIFFERENT TEAMS OF RESEARCHERS, ARE USED TO PREDICT SOIL BEHAVIOUR ALONG THE SAME STRESS PATH.

DESPITE THE OBVIOUS BENEFITS OF THESE COMPACTED MIXTURES (THE BACKFILLING OPERATION BECOMES EASIER AND THE GAPS BETWEEN THE HOST ROCK AND THE BUFFER ARE MINIMISED), THERE ARE SEVERAL ASPECTS OF CONCERN SUCH AS THE EFFECTIVE BLOCKAGE OF THE LARGE INTER PELLET PORES DUE TO GRANULE SWELLING THIS BLOCKAGE IMPROVES THE WATER PERMEABILITY PROPERTIES AND THE TENDENCY TO DEVELOP INITIAL COLLAPSES BEFORE REACHING AN ADEQUATE SWELLING PRESSURE. SELECTED TEST RESULTS OF A COMPREHENSIVE LABORATORY EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAMME ARE PRESENTED TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO THE HYDROMECHANICAL RESPONSE OF THIS MULTI POROSITY COMPACTED MATERIAL. TO IMPROVE THE INFORMATION ON LOCAL TRANSIENT BEHAVIOUR, SIMULATION ASSISTED TECHNIQUES USING A DOUBLE STRUCTURE CONSTITUTIVE MODEL ARE USED.

TECHNIQUES TESTED BY THE EIGHT MECHANICS OF UNSATURATED SOILS FOR ENGINEERING RESEARCH TEAMS INCLUDE AXIS TRANSLATION (PRESSURE PLATE AND SUCTION CONTROLLED OEDOMETER), HIGHCAPACITY TENSIOMETER AND OSMOTIC TECHNIQUE. THE SOIL USED IN THE EXERCISE WAS A MIXTURE OF UNIFORM SAND, SODIUM BENTONITE (ACTIVE CLAY) AND KAOLINITE (NON ACTIVE CLAY), WHICH WERE ALL COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE. SAMPLES WERE PREPARED BY ONE TEAM AND DISTRIBUTED TO ALL OTHER TEAMS. THEY WERE NORMALLY CONSOLIDATED FROM SLURRY UNDER ONE DIMENSIONAL CONDITIONS (CONSOLIDOMETER) TO A GIVEN VERTICAL STRESS. THE WATER RETENTION CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INITIALLY SATURATED SPECIMENS WERE INVESTIGATED ALONG THE MAIN DRYING PATH. SPECIMENS WERE DE SATURATED BY APPLYING SUCTION THROUGH THE LIQUID PHASE WHEN USING AN AXIS TRANSLATION TECHNIQUE OR OSMOTIC METHOD AND DE SATURATED BY AIR DRYING, WHEN SUCTION WAS MEASURED USING HIGH CAPACITY TENSIOMETERS. IN GENERAL, THE SAME TECHNIQUE WAS TESTED BY AT LEAST TWO TEAMS. THE WATER RETENTION CURVES OBTAINED USING THE DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES ARE COMPARED AND DISCREPANCIES ARE DISCUSSED IN THE PAPER.

FOR THIS REASON LABORATORY TESTING OF TAILINGS IS GENERALLY CONDUCTED ON RECONSTITUTED MATERIAL. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT LABORATORY SAMPLE PREPARATION METHODS CAN AFFECT THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF COHESIONLESS SOIL AND IT IS GENERALLY BELIEVED THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DIFFERENCE IN THE FABRIC (PARTICLE ARRANGEMENT) INHERENT IN THE PREPARATION METHOD. AN EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAMME WAS CONDUCTED TO (A) EXAMINE THE FABRIC WHICH ENSUES UPON SAMPLE PREPARATION AND (B) TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF ANY FABRIC DIFFERENCES ON THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF GOLD TAILINGS. COMPARISON WAS MADE BETWEEN THE BEHAVIOUR AND FABRIC OF UNDISTURBED AND RECONSTITUTED MOIST TAMPED AND SLURRY DEPOSITED SAMPLES. THE RESULTS FROM THE EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAMME SHOW THAT THERE IS INDEED A DIFFERENCE IN FABRIC BETWEEN UNDISTURBED AND RECONSTITUTED GOLD TAILINGS SAMPLES. SLURRY PREPARATION GENERALLY REPLICATES THE FABRIC AND BEHAVIOUR OF THE UNDISTURBED SAMPLE BETTER THAN MOIST TAMPING, BUT NEITHER FULLY REPLICATES THE UNDISTURBED SAMPLE. AT LARGE STRAINS, THE SAMPLES REACH A UNIQUE CRITICAL STATE FRICTION ANGLE, BUT AT DIFFERENT STRESS STATES.

IF SAND PARTICLES DO NOT FORM A SKELETAL STRUCTURE, AND EACH PARTICLE IS INDEPENDENT IN THE CLAY MATRIX, AN ADDITIVE FRACTION OF SAND CAUSES A DECREASE IN THE COMPRESSIBILITY; HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT AFFECT THE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY UNDER THE SAME CONSOLIDATION PRESSURE. THE ADDITIVE FRACTION OF BENTONITE CONTRIBUTES TO A DECREASE IN THE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY, EVEN FOR CLAYEY MATERIALS. IN ADDITION, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PORE SIZE PARAMETER, WHICH REPRESENTS THE PORE ENTRANCE SIZE DISTRIBUTION, AND THE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY IS DISCUSSED USING A PROBABILISTIC MODEL KNOWN AS THE GENERAL CAPILLARY MODEL.

RING SHEAR EXPERIMENTS INVESTIGATED THE INFLUENCES OF INTERFACE POSITION, DISPLACEMENT SCALE, NORMAL STRESS LEVEL AND PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION ON ULTIMATE INTERFACE FRICTION ANGLE, DELTACV GRAIN CRUSHING IS SHOWN TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE WITHIN A CONCENTRATED SHEAR ZONE, AND THIS PROCESS, ALONG WITH CHANGES IN THE ROUGHNESS OF THE INTERFACE, COULD LEAD TO DELTA VALUES MARKEDLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE DEVELOPED IN CONVENTIONAL SMALL DISPLACEMENT DIRECT SHEAR TESTS. IT IS ALSO SHOWN THAT DELTA MEASUREMENTS AT SMALLER DISPLACEMENTS MAY DEPEND ON WHETHER THE INTERFACE IS MOUNTED ABOVE OR BELOW THE SAMPLE, BUT THAT SUCH DIFFERENCES DIMINISH TO ZERO WHEN DISPLACEMENTS ARE LARGE. THE FINDING THAT DELTA IS STRONGLY DISPLACEMENT DEPENDENT OVER THE SINGLE MILLIMETRE TO MULTIPLE METRE SCALE HAS MANY PRACTICAL GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING IMPLICATIONS.

THE MODEL IS BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF A MACROELEMENT. ACCORDING TO THIS CONCEPT, THE FOUNDATION AND THE SUBSOIL CAN BE SEEN AS A UNIQUE VOLUME ELEMENT. A MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIP IS ESTABLISHED THAT LINKS THE FORCE AND MOMENT ACTING ON THE FOUNDATION AND THE CORRESPONDING DISPLACEMENT AND ROTATION, AS IF THEY WERE GENERALISED STRESSES AND STRAINS, RESPECTIVELY. THIS RELATIONSHIP IS BASED ON THE THEORY OF HARDENING PLASTICITY, WITH TWO HARDENING VARIABLES, BOTH FUNCTIONS OF THE PERMANENT GENERALISED STRAINS. IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE SECOND OF SUCH VARIABLES, CONNECTED TO THE ACTION OF INTERGRANULAR BONDS, MONOTONICALLY DECREASES AS STRAINS PROGRESS AND BONDS CRUSH. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE MODEL CAN REPRODUCE QUITE WELL THE OBSERVED DISPLACEMENT AND ROTATION OF A MODEL CIRCULAR FOUNDATION ON A LAYER OF CALCARENITE. A PARAMETRIC STUDY ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THAT THE MODEL CAN IN PRINCIPLE PREDICT THE PHENOMENON OF COLLAPSE, ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED BY FOUNDATIONS ON HIGH POROSITY ROCKS WHEN A CERTAIN GENERALISED STRESS OR STRAIN THRESHOLD IS REACHED. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT SUCH A PHENOMENON CAN TAKE PLACE WHEN BONDS ARE CHARACTERISED BY HIGH STRENGTH THAT IS RAPIDLY DECREASING WITH STRAIN. IT IS FINALLY SHOWN THAT WEATHERING INDUCED COLLAPSE UNDER CONSTANT EXTERNAL LOADING CAN ALSO, IN PRINCIPLE, BE MODELLED IN THIS FRAMEWORK.

IT IS INFLUENCED BY PROCEDURAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND STRUCTURAL FACTORS. IN PARTICULAR, THE INITIAL HYDRATION STATE OF A SOIL (EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF SATURATION DEGREE, WATER CONTENT OR SUCTION), ITS INITIAL LEVEL OF COMPACTION (EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF VOID RATIO OR DRY UNIT WEIGHT) AND THE LEVEL OF CONFINEMENT ARE AMONG THE INFLUENCING PARAMETERS MOST STUDIED. CHARACTERISING THE SWELLING POTENTIAL OF A SOIL IN THE LABORATORY IS AN EXTENSIVE TASK AND TOOLS FOR PREDICTION ARE SOMEHOW LIMITED. THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO USE DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS TO PREDICT THE AMOUNT OF SOIL SWELLING. THIS APPROACH MAKES USE OF THE BUCKINGHAM PI THEOREM TO REDUCE AN EQUATION DESCRIBING A PHYSICAL PHENOMENON INTO AN EQUATION INVOLVING A REDUCED NUMBER OF PARAMETERS, WHICH ARE DIMENSIONLESS. ONE OF THESE NUMBERS, CALLED DSPW, WAS SPECIFICALLY DERIVED AND VALIDATED USING DATASETS FROM THE LITERATURE. THESE DATA WERE OBTAINED FROM MONOTONIC ONE DIMENSIONAL SWELLING TESTS UNTIL FULL SATURATION. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS AND THE RESULTING DIMENSIONLESS MODEL CAN BE USED TO PREDICT SOIL SWELLING WITH RELATIVELY GOOD ACCURACY.

VIVID EXAMPLES ARE PROVIDED BY TWO RECENT EVENTS: THE KOBE EARTHQUAKE (M L 7.2, 1995), INVOLVING KOBE PORT, PORT ISLAND, ROKKO ISLAND AND FUKAE ISLAND IN JAPAN; AND THE CHI CHI EARTHQUAKE (M L 7.3, 1999), INVOLVING TAICHUNG HARBOUR IN TAIWAN. THE RESULTS OF SURVEYS OF DEFORMATION PATTERNS OF THE GROUND SURFACE AT THE TWO HARBOURS AFTER THE EVENTS, AND THE PUBLISHED RESULTS OF WELL PLANNED SHAKING TABLE TESTS, ARE ANALYSED: THE SHAKING TABLE TESTS PROVIDED IMAGES OF THE DEFORMED PROFILES FOR THE SUBMERGED BACKFILL OF A SCALED DOWN QUAYWALL MODEL. ON THE BASIS OF THESE DATA A SIMPLE MODEL IS PROPOSED TO EXPLAIN THE FAILURE MECHANISM IN LARGE LATERAL DISPLACEMENTS OF GRAVITY QUAYWALLS DURING EARTHQUAKES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE MONO NOBE OKABE THEORY UNDERESTIMATES THE RESULTANT OF EARTH PRESSURE FROM THE LIQUEFIED SUBMERGED BACKFILL. FOR THE CASES OF THE TWO EARTHQUAKES STUDIED IN THIS PAPER, SEVERAL DIMENSIONLESS PARAMETERS OBTAINED BY USING THE PROPOSED SIMPLE MODEL HAVE SIMILAR VALUES.

BASED ON INHERENT AND MAN MADE FEATURES OF FAILED AND NOT FAILED SLOPES, LOCATIONS OF POSSIBLE FUTURE LANDSLIDES OWING TO RAINFALL ALONG ROUTE T 18 ARE PREDICTED. TOGETHER WITH HISTORICAL RAINFALL DATA, A RAINFALL FRAGILITY GRAPH IS ESTABLISHED. THE ANALYSIS RESULTS SHOW THAT THE GAUSSIAN PROCESS MODEL IS EFFECTIVE IN PREDICTING LANDSLIDE POTENTIALS AND PROBABILITIES. COMPARISONS OF THE GAUSSIAN PROCESS ANALYSIS AND THE DISCRIMINANT FUNCTION ANALYSIS ARE MADE, WHICH SHOW THAT THE FORMER OUTPERFORMS THE LATTER IN MANY RESPECTS. THE RESULTS ARE VALUABLE FOR PREDICTING WHERE AND WHEN LANDSLIDES WOULD OCCUR ALONG ROUTE T 18 IN FUTURE HEAVY RAINFALLS.

THE DEVELOPED SUBGRADE REACTION SOLUTION CAN DEAL WITH THE CASE IN WHICH PILE SEGMENTS IN BOTH SLIDING AND STABLE LAYERS ARE NOT FLEXIBLE, AND CAN ALSO CALCULATE THE PILE RESPONSE UNDER THE ADDITIONAL RESISTANCE REQUIRED TO STABILISE THE LANDSLIDE. TRANSFORMING COORDINATE SYSTEMS, THE CONVENTIONAL SOLUTION CAN BE OBTAINED FROM THE DEVELOPED SUBGRADE REACTION SOLUTION FOR THE CASE IN WHICH THE MOVEMENT OF THE SLIDING LAYER IS UNIFORM WITH DEPTH. TWO CASE STUDIES INDICATE THAT THE PILE RESPONSE, ESPECIALLY THE MAXIMUM BENDING MOMENT, CALCULATED BY USING THE DEVELOPED SUBGRADE REACTION SOLUTION, WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE MEASUREMENTS. THE MOVEMENT GRADIENT OF THE SLIDING LAYER HAD A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE RESPONSE OF STABILISING PILES, AND IT USUALLY INCREASED THE MAXIMUM BENDING MOMENT OF THE PILE SEGMENT IN THE STABLE LAYER. STABILISING PILES WOULD BE POTENTIALLY UNSAFE IF SUCH INFLUENCE WERE NOT CONSIDERED IN DESIGN. USING THE DEVELOPED SUBGRADE REACTION SOLUTION, DIMENSIONLESS DESIGN CHARTS WERE CREATED FOR THE CASE IN WHICH THE PILE SEGMENT IN THE SLIDING LAYER IS NOT FLEXIBLE.

THE TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT WITH AN INSTRUMENTED SINGLE MODEL PILE IN TWO CONFIGURATIONS: IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE RAFT AND SEPARATED FROM THE RAFT BY A COARSE GRANULAR LAYER. AS THE MODEL TESTS SHOW, A GRANULAR LAYER BENEATH A RAFT CHANGES THE PILE SHAFT BEHAVIOUR SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED WITH THAT EXHIBITED BY A PILE IN CONTACT; IT ALLOWS DOWNWARD RELATIVE RAFT PILE AND SOIL PILE DISPLACEMENT AND THE CONSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT OF NEGATIVE SKIN FRICTION AROUND THE UPPER PILE SHAFT PERIMETER. HENCE, THE RAFT LOAD IS PARTIALLY TRANSFERRED TO THE PILE THROUGH THE PILE HEAD AND PARTIALLY THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SKIN FRICTION OF THE UPPER SHAFT. THE CONTACT PILE REDUCES THE RAFT STRESS ON THE SOIL, AND THEN A PILED RAFT STIFFNESS RESULTS THAT IS CLOSE TO THAT OF A FREE STANDING PILE UP TO YIELD LOAD AND CLOSE TO THAT OF AN UNPILED RAFT AFTER THE YIELD LOAD HAS BEEN REACHED; THE NON CONTACT PILE INCREASES THE PILED RAFT STIFFNESS OVER THE WHOLE INVESTIGATED SETTLEMENT RANGE WITH RESPECT TO THE UNPILED RAFT.

BOTH DRAINED AND UNDRAINED TRIAXIAL COMPRESSION TESTS ON THE MATERIAL WERE CONDUCTED. DESPITE THE HIGH FLEXIBILITY OF THE RUBBER CHIPS AND HENCE THEIR HIGHER DUCTILITY, THE MATERIAL BEHAVIOUR WAS FOUND TO BE GENERALLY SIMILAR TO THAT OF TYPICAL CEMENTED SOILS. DATA POINTS WITH THE SAME DEVIATORIC STRAIN IN P Q SPACE WERE LINKED UP TO FORM A SERIES OF EQUIDEVIATORIC STRAIN LINES, AND A DEGRADABLE COHESION INTERCEPT IS OBSERVED IN THE PLOT. THERE WAS ALSO A TENTATIVE CRITICAL STATE LINE IN P Q E SPACE (E BEING THE VOID RATIO) THAT WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE CORRESPONDING PARENT SOIL (UNBONDED, CEMENT COATED CHIPS). IN AN UNLOADING RELOADING STRESS STRAIN CURVE THE UNLOADING PATH WAS PRACTICALLY IDENTICAL TO THE RELOADING PATH IN A CONSTANT P9 TEST, BUT MORE CURVED IN A CONSOLIDATED DRAINED TEST.

DURING THE SUBSEQUENT DISSIPATION PROCESS, THE EFFECTIVE STRESS AT THE PIPE SOIL INTERFACE AND THE AVAILABLE AXIAL PIPE SOIL RESISTANCE RISE. THIS SET UP OF AXIAL RESISTANCE IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF PIPELINE DESIGN, INCLUDING THE MITIGATION OF THERMAL AND PRESSURE INDUCED EXPANSION, THE STABILITY OF THE PIPELINE ON SLOPING GROUND AND THE ASSESSMENT OF PIPE SOIL FORCES DURING INSTALLATION. A SET OF FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSES HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO ASSESS THE PORE PRESSURE DISSIPATION AND CONSOLIDATION BENEATH PARTIALLY EMBEDDED SEABED PIPELINES, EXTENDING EXISTING SOLUTIONS FOR STRIP FOOTINGS. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE CURVED SHAPE OF A PIPELINE INCREASES THE NORMALISED RATE OF CONSOLIDATION COMPARED WITH A STRIP FOOTING. DISSIPATION CURVES FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF EMBEDMENT ARE PRESENTED AND THE CALCULATED RESPONSE IS SHOWN TO COMPARE WELL WITH DATA FROM A FIELD TEST CONDUCTED ON A SOFT CLAY. THE DISSIPATION CURVES HAVE BEEN USED TO DERIVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE CONTACT FORCE BETWEEN THE PIPE AND THE SEABED AS CONSOLIDATION PROGRESSES. THESE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT OF THIS FORCE AND THEREFORE THE AVAILABLE AXIAL RESISTANCE THAT ARISES FROM A WEDGING EFFECT RELATED TO THE CURVATURE OF THE PIPE SOIL CONTACT SURFACE. THIS WEDGING EFFECT LEADS TO A BENEFICIAL ENHANCEMENT OF THE AXIAL RESISTANCE.

IN THIS PAPER THE PROBLEM OF STRIP AND CIRCULAR FOOTINGS RESTING ON THE SURFACE OF A SAND LAYER IS ANALYSED USING THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD. ANALYSES ARE PERFORMED USING A TWO SURFACE PLASTICITY CONSTITUTIVE MODEL THAT REALISTICALLY CAPTURES THE ASPECTS OF THE MECHANICAL RESPONSE OF SANDS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THE BEARING CAPACITY PROBLEM. IN PARTICULAR, THE MODEL ACCOUNTS FOR NON ASSOCIATED FLOW, STRAIN SOFTENING, AND BOTH STRESS INDUCED AND INHERENT ANISOTROPY. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSES, THE PAPER EXAMINES THE VALIDITY OF THE BEARING CAPACITY FACTORS NA AND SHAPE FACTORS SA USED IN PRACTICE.

IN THE MODEL, THE FREE ENERGY (THE INTERNAL ENERGY AVAILABLE TO DO WORK) IS CONTRIBUTED PARTLY BY THE SO CALLED FROZEN OR LOCKED ENERGY, WHOSE EVOLUTION IS ASSUMED TO BE HOMOGENEOUSLY RELATED TO THE IRRECOVERABLE DEFORMATION. DURING LOADING, THE BONDS EXISTING IN THE NATURAL SOIL NOT ONLY BOOST THE DISSIPATION RATE BUT ALSO LIBERATE CERTAIN HISTORICALLY ACCUMULATED LOCKED ENERGY. SUCH EFFECTS, HOWEVER, ARE DIMINISHED AS LOADING PROCEEDS AND THE BONDS ARE DESTROYED. THE NOVEL ASPECT OF THE PRESENT MODEL IS THAT IT ACCOMMODATES BOTH THE MOHR COULOMB AND CRITICAL STATE FAILURE MODES, AND THE TWO MODES ARE UNIFIED THROUGH THE EVOLUTION LAW OF A THERMODYNAMIC FORCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOCKED BONDING ENERGY. AS COMPARED WITH THE CLASSICAL CAM CLAY MODELS, THE MODEL CONTAINS TWO ADDITIONAL MATERIAL CONSTANTS, WHERE ONE IS PROPOSED BY COLLINS & KELLY TO IMPROVE THE SHAPE OF THE YIELD SURFACE, AND THE OTHER IS DEDICATED TO BONDING EVOLUTION. THE CALIBRATION PROCEDURE FOR THE MATERIAL PARAMETERS IS PROVIDED. THE CAPABILITY OF THE MODEL IS DEMONSTRATED BY A SERIES OF MODEL SIMULATIONS ON A HYPOTHETICAL BONDED SOIL UNDER VARIOUS TRIAXIAL LOADING PATHS, AND THE MODEL RESPONSE IS ALSO COMPARED WITH REPRESENTATIVE TESTING RESULTS IN THE LITERATURE.

AN ATTEMPT IS MADE HERE TO CLARIFY THE QUESTION FROM A MICROMECHANICAL VIEWPOINT BY MEANS OF A GRAIN SCALE MODELLING TECHNIQUE COMBINED WITH STATISTICAL ANALYSES. THE STUDY SHOWS THAT THE QUASI STEADY STATE IS A REAL BEHAVIOUR RATHER THAN A TEST INDUCED PHENOMENON; IT IS A TRANSITION STATE, AND CAN BE REGARDED AS THE RESULT OF SPATIAL REARRANGEMENT OF DISCRETE PARTICLES SHEARED UNDER THE CONSTANT VOLUME CONDITION. THE QUASI STEADY STATE HAS DISTINCT FEATURES THAT MAKE IT DIFFERENT FROM THE STEADY STATE AT BOTH THE MACRO SCALE AND MICRO SCALE. DURING THE LOADING PROCESS, THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF CONTACTS PER PARTICLE DECREASES WITH STRAIN UNTIL THE QUASI STEADY STATE EMERGES, AND AFTER THAT IT INCREASES GRADUALLY TO AN APPROXIMATELY CONSTANT VALUE AT LARGE DEFORMATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE STEADY STATE. THIS RESULT SUGGESTS THAT THE LOSS OF CONTACTS IS MOST PRONOUNCED AT THE QUASI STEADY STATE. THE STUDY ALSO SHOWS THAT THE CONTACT NORMAL FORCES AND PARTICLE ROTATIONS PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN THE DEFORMATION PROCESS, WHEREAS THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CONTACT TANGENTIAL FORCES AND PARTICLE SLIDING APPEAR TO BE MINOR.

AS A PIPE IS LAID ON THE SEABED IT OSCILLATES, OWING TO VESSEL MOTION AND HYDRODYNAMIC LOADING OF THE HANGING PIPE. THIS MOVEMENT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE PIPE EMBEDMENT BEYOND THE THEORETICAL VALUE RELATED TO THE STATIC PIPE WEIGHT, EVEN WHEN CORRECTED FOR ANY STRESS CONCENTRATION CAUSED BY THE HANGING CATENARY. DYNAMIC LAY EFFECTS ARE EITHER IGNORED IN PRACTICE, OR ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY SCALING UP THE STATIC EMBEDMENT BY AN EMPIRICAL FACTOR, LEADING TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IN THIS IMPORTANT DESIGN PARAMETER. A SERIES OF CENTRIFUGE MODEL TESTS HAS BEEN CONDUCTED USING TWO CLAYS KAOLIN AND A HIGH PLASTICITY NATURAL CLAY TO SIMULATE THE DYNAMIC EMBEDMENT PROCESS. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT ONLY A FEW CYCLES OF SMALL AMPLITUDE OSCILLATION (60.05D) ARE REQUIRED TO DOUBLE OR TRIPLE THE PIPE EMBEDMENT, OWING TO THE COMBINED EFFECT OF LATERAL PLOUGHING AND SOIL SOFTENING. IN THESE EXPERIMENTS THE PIPE EMBEDMENT INCREASED TO UP TO EIGHT TIMES THE STATIC EMBEDMENT AFTER 100 CYCLES OF MOTION, WHICH REPRESENTS A TYPICAL LAY PROCESS. A MODEL IS PROPOSED FOR THE CYCLEBY CYCLE EMBEDMENT OF A PIPELINE UNDER A GIVEN SEQUENCE OF SMALL AMPLITUDE OSCILLATIONS AT A GIVEN APPLIED VERTICAL FORCE. THE TRAJECTORY OF THE PIPE MOVEMENT IS ASSESSED USING A FLOW RULE DERIVED FROM PLASTICITY BASED YIELD ENVELOPES. THE EFFECT OF SOIL REMOULDING IS EXPLICITLY CAPTURED BY LINKING THE ACCUMULATED DISTURBANCE TO THE DECAY IN SOIL STRENGTH. USING INPUT PARAMETERS DERIVED FROM THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND T BAR PENETROMETER TESTS, THE MODEL CAPTURES THE ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF THE DYNAMIC EMBEDMENT PROCESS. WITH MODEST OPTIMIZATION OF THE MODEL PARAMETERS, THE MEAN DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE CALCULATED AND MEASURED EMBEDMENT IS ONLY 12% FOR BOTH CLAYS. THE ULTIMATE STATES PREDICTED BY THIS CYCLE BYCYCLE MODEL ALSO PROVIDE A ROUGH ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM PIPE EMBEDMENT FOR FULLY REMOULDED CONDITIONS, WHICH INCLUDE SOME DEGREE OF WATER ENTRAINMENT CAUSED BY THE LAY PROCESS, EVIDENT IN THE OPTIMISED PARAMETERS. THIS ULTIMATE EMBEDMENT IS GOVERNED BY THE REMOULDED SOIL STRENGTH AND THE PIPE WEIGHT (AUGMENTED BY ANY STRESS CONCENTRATION). THE AMPLITUDE OF THE CYCLIC MOTION AFFECTS THE RATE OF SOFTENING, AND HENCE THE RATE OF SETTLEMENT. THIS MODEL PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING THE AS LAID EMBEDMENT OF SEABED PIPELINES ON A MORE RIGOROUS BASIS THAN CURRENT PRACTICE.

M., STATE KEY LABORATORY OF HYDROSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, INSTITUTE OF GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING, DEPARTMENT OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING, TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY, BEIJING, CHINA	DILATANCY IS ONE OF THE KEY PROPERTIES OF THE SOIL STRUCTURE INTERFACE. A NUMBER OF MONOTONIC AND CYCLIC SHEAR TESTS WERE ANALYSED TO DERIVE THE RULES AND THE DILATANCY MECHANISM OF THE INTERFACE BETWEEN A STRUCTURE AND A GRAVELLY SOIL; DIVERSE INFLUENTIAL FACTORS WERE CONSIDERED, SUCH AS SOIL TYPE, ROUGHNESS OF THE STRUCTURE AND NORMAL STRESS. THE VOLUMETRIC CHANGE DUE TO THE DILATANCY CONSISTS OF A REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE DILATANCY COMPONENT, EACH OF WHICH HAS DIFFERENT MECHANISMS, DIFFERENT RULES AND DIFFERENT CONTROL FACTORS. THE REVERSIBLE DILATANCY COMPONENT IS STRONGLY DEPENDENT ON THE DIRECTION OF THE APPLIED SHEAR AFTER AN INITIAL APPLICATION OF SHEAR LOADING. THE IRREVERSIBLE DILATANCY COMPONENT GRADUALLY INCREASES OWING TO THE CONTINUED APPLICATION OF SHEAR AND EXHIBITS A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EVOLUTION OF THE PHYSICAL STATE. THE VOLUMETRIC CHANGE THAT IS DUE TO THE DILATANCY MAINLY DEPENDS ON PART OF THE TANGENTIAL DISPLACEMENT WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE DEFORMATION OF THE SOIL THAT IS CONSTRAINED BY THE STRUCTURE; SUCH A PART OF THE TANGENTIAL DISPLACEMENT IS SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDENT ON THE STATE OF THE ENTIRE TANGENTIAL DISPLACEMENT, ON THE NORMAL STRESS AND ON THE FEATURES OF BOTH THE STRUCTURE AND THE SOIL. THE ROUGHNESS OF THE STRUCTURE, THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE SOIL AND THE NORMAL STRESS HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON THE DILATANCY BEHAVIOUR OF THE INTERFACE.

THE TESTING PROGRAMME, CONDUCTED ON A STANDARD SAND UNDER TRIAXIAL CONDITIONS, COVERS A BROAD RANGE OF INITIAL STATES IN TERMS OF RELATIVE DENSITY, CONFINING STRESS AND INITIAL SHEAR STRESS RATIO (ALFA). THREE DISTINCT FAILURE MODES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FROM THE TESTS: FLOW TYPE FAILURE, CYCLIC MOBILITY AND PLASTIC STRAIN ACCUMULATION. OF THESE, FLOWTYPE FAILURE, CHARACTERISED BY ABRUPT RUNAWAY DEFORMATIONS WITHOUT ANY PRIOR WARNING, IS THE MOST CRITICAL, AND PERTAINS TO SAND IN THE LOOSE STATE. THE TESTS ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PRESENCE OF INITIAL STATIC SHEAR STRESS IS BENEFICIAL TO THE LIQUEFACTION RESISTANCE OF LOOSE SAND AT LOW ALFA LEVELS, BUT IT BECOMES DETRIMENTAL AT HIGH FI LEVELS. IN THIS CONNECTION THE CONCEPT OF THRESHOLD ALFA IS PROPOSED, TOGETHER WITH THE USE OF A NO STRESS REVERSAL LINE FOR BETTER CHARACTERISATION OF THE EFFECT OF INITIAL STATIC SHEAR. FURTHERMORE, IN THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF CRITICAL STATE SOIL MECHANICS, A FAIRLY GOOD LINEAR RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE THRESHOLD ALFA AND THE STATE PARAMETER FI THAT COLLECTIVELY ACCOUNTS FOR THE INITIAL RELATIVE DENSITY AND MEAN STRESS LEVEL. THIS RELATIONSHIP SUGGESTS THAT THE THRESHOLD ALFA DECREASES WITH INCREASING VALUES OF FI, OR WITH SAND BECOMING LOOSER THAN THE CRITICAL STATE. IT IS FURTHER PROPOSED THAT THE CONCEPT OF THRESHOLD ALFA ALSO APPLIES TO SAND AT HIGH RELATIVE DENSITY, AS LONG AS THE CONFINING STRESS BECOMES SUFFICIENTLY HIGH. THIS PROPOSAL LEADS TO A UNIFIED AND CONSISTENT INTERPRETATION OF THE COMPLICATED STATIC SHEAR EFFECT.

IT CONSIDERS THE GROWTH IN EMPHASIS OF THE PREDICTION OF GROUND DISPLACEMENTS DURING DESIGN IN THE PAST TWO DECADES OF THE 20TH CENTURY, AS A RESULT OF THE LESSONS LEARNT FROM FIELD OBSERVATIONS. THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE THEORY OF ELASTICITY IS THEN DESCRIBED, AS ARE THE CONSTITUTIVE FRAMEWORKS WITHIN WHICH IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED THAT GEOTECHNICAL PREDICTIONS OF DEFORMATION SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT. FACTORS AFFECTING THE STIFFNESS OF SOILS AND WEAK ROCKS ARE REVIEWED, AND THE RESULTS OF A NUMERICAL EXPERIMENT, ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF A NUMBER OF STIFFNESS PARAMETERS ON THE DISPLACEMENTS AROUND A RETAINING STRUCTURE, ARE DESCRIBED. SOME FIELD AND LABORATORY METHODS OF OBTAINING STIFFNESS PARAMETERS ARE CONSIDERED AND CRITICALLY DISCUSSED, AND THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH A SUGGESTED STRATEGY FOR THE MEASUREMENT AND INTEGRATION OF STIFFNESS DATA, AND THE DEVELOPMENTS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE THE EXISTING STATE OF THE ART.

S., DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, FACULTY OF ENGINEERING, UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM, UNITED KINGDOM	THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF THE CONE PENETRATION TEST IN MULTI LAYERED CLAYS USING THE COMMERCIAL FINITEELEMENT CODE ABAQUS/EXPLICIT. THE VON MISES YIELD CRITERION AND ITS ASSOCIATED FLOW RULE ARE ASSUMED TO MODEL THE PLASTIC BEHAVIOUR OF ELASTOPLASTIC UNDRAINED CLAYS. AN ARBITRARY LAGRANGIAN EULERIAN SCHEME AND AN ENHANCED HOURGLASS ALGORITHM ARE ADOPTED TO PRESERVE THE QUALITY OF MESH THROUGHOUT THE NUMERICAL SIMULATION. INITIALLY, THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE PENETRATION RESISTANCE IS EXAMINED IN A SOIL WITH ONLY TWO LAYERS. THE BOTTOM LAYER IS THE WEAKER OF THE TWO AND THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE PENETRATION RESISTANCE WHEN THE CONE APPROACHES THE LOWER LAYER IS STUDIED. THE INVESTIGATION IS THEN EXTENDED TO STUDY THE CONE PENETRATION TEST IN A MULTI LAYERED CLAY BY SANDWICHING A WEAKER CLAY LAYER BETWEEN TWO STRONGER CLAY LAYERS. THE THICKNESS OF THE WEAKER CLAY LAYER IS VARIED AND THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE PENETRATION RESISTANCE IS STUDIED IN RELATION TO THE THICKNESS AND RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE SOIL LAYERS. THE RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED WITH RESPECT TO THE SOIL MECHANISMS THAT ARE PRESENT WHEN THE CONE MOVES PAST THE RELEVANT LAYER BOUNDARIES SO THAT THE POSITION OF THESE BOUNDARIES CAN BE DETERMINED MORE ACCURATELY.

THESE EXPERIMENTS REQUIRE CONSOLIDATION OF FINE GRAINED SAMPLES IN TRIAXIAL OR STRESS PATH APPARATUS. THE TIME REQUIRED FOR THE CONSOLIDATION IS DEPENDENT ON THE PERMEABILITY OF THE SOIL AND THE LENGTH OF THE DRAINAGE PATH. THE CONSOLIDATION TIME IS OFTEN OF THE ORDER OF SEVERAL WEEKS IN LARGE CLAY DOMINATED SAMPLES. LONG TESTING PERIODS CAN BE PROBLEMATIC, AS THEY CAN DELAY DECISIONS ON DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION METHODS. ACCELERATION OF THE CONSOLIDATION PROCESS WOULD REQUIRE A REDUCTION IN EFFECTIVE DRAINAGE LENGTH AND THIS IS USUALLY ACHIEVED BY PLACING FILTER DRAINS AROUND THE SAMPLE. THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH REPORTED IN THIS PAPER IS TO ASSESS IF THESE FILTER DRAINS WORK EFFECTIVELY AND, IF NOT, TO DETERMINE WHAT MODIFICATIONS TO THE FILTER DRAINS ARE NEEDED. THE FINDINGS HAVE SHOWN THAT USE OF A DOUBLE FILTER REDUCES THE CONSOLIDATION TIME SEVERAL FOLD.

OPTICAL FIBRES ATTACHED ALONG THE INTRADOS OF THE TUNNEL LINING AT FIVE CIRCUMFERENTIAL SECTIONS RECORDED THE RELATIVE STRAINS OF TUNNEL DEFORMATION BETWEEN THE FIXING POINTS AS WELL AS DETECTING LOCALISED STRAIN SUCH AS CRACKING IN THE MASONRY. THE RESULTS INDICATED WHERE CRACKING MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED AND WERE CONFIRMED WITH VISUAL INSPECTION. MEASUREMENTS WERE COMPARED WITH THE DATA OBTAINED BY SURVEYING USING TOTAL STATION UNITS AND THE RESULTS SHOW CLOSE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS. FLEXURAL BEHAVIOUR ALONG THE LONGITUDINAL SECTION OF THE TUNNEL WAS ALSO EXAMINED BY MEASURING STRAIN ALONG THE SPRINGLINES AND CROWN.

MOST VARIATIONS OF THE KOZENY CARMAN FORMULA COMPUTE THE PARAMETER DEFF BASED ON A GIVEN CONVENTIONAL PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION BY MASS (PSDM), WHERE THE VALIDATION WOULD NORMALLY BE CARRIED OUT BY COMPARING AGAINST LABORATORY PERMEABILITY TESTS CONDUCTED ON SOILS HAVING AN AVERAGE COEFFICIENT OF UNIFORMITY (CU) OF ABOUT 3. KNOWING THAT THE KOZENY CARMAN FORMULA WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED FOR UNIFORMLY GRADED MATERIALS, INEVITABLE LIMITATIONS ARE INHERITED WHEN IT IS APPLIED TO INCREASINGLY GRADED SOILS. THIS STUDY PROPOSES TO CONVERT THE PSDM INTO ITS EQUIVALENCE IN SURFACE AREA (PSDSA) CONFORMING TO THE FUNDAMENTAL GEOMETRIC ASSUMPTION BY WHICH THE KOZENY CARMAN EQUATION WAS ORIGINALLY FORMULATED. THE ESTIMATED DEFF BASED ON THIS PROPOSED PSDSA METHOD APPEARS IMPLICITLY TO INCORPORATE THE SIZE, SHAPE AND ANGULARITY OF THE NATURAL GRAINS WHICH WERE TRADITIONALLY REPRESENTED BY THE SHAPE COEFFICIENT (ALFA). THE RESULTS PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER SHOW THAT THE SUGGESTED METHOD IS CAPABLE OF PREDICTING K FOR FULLY SATURATED GRANULAR SOILS WITH CU OF UP 20.

THE PAPERS DISPLAY THE COMPLEXITY OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF STIFF CLAYS, AND THE VERY HIGH LEVEL OF EXPERTISE COMMITTED TO RESEARCHING IT. THE FEATURES OF BEHAVIOUR DESCRIBED, AND TO SOME EXTENT QUANTIFIED, ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN UNDERSTANDING OBSERVED PHENOMENA IN CONVENTIONAL CIVIL ENGINEERING SITUATIONS. STUDIES OF THE STRATIGRAPHY OF LONDON CLAY, AS AN EXAMPLE, SHOW SOME HELPFUL CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE DEPOSIT WHEN RESULTS ARE PLOTTED RELATIVE TO ITS BASE, BUT ALSO SHOW THAT IT IS NOT A SINGLE, UNIFORM MATERIAL. ENGINEERING AT GREATER DEPTH AND WITH THERMAL EFFECTS, AS REQUIRED FOR NUCLEAR REPOSITORIES, PROVIDES SOME NEW CHALLENGES, INVOLVING BOTH UNFAMILIAR PARAMETERS AND MORE FAMILIAR PROBLEMS OF CHARACTERISING STIFFNESS, STRENGTH AND PERMEABILITY, ESPECIALLY IN BONDED MATERIALS, SET IN A CONTEXT OF HIGHER STRESSES. THE COMBINATION OF HIGH QUALITY LABORATORY STUDIES WITH FIELD OBSERVATIONS OF FULL SCALE BEHAVIOUR REMAINS ESSENTIAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING, AND BOTH ARE WELL REPRESENTED IN THE PAPERS TO THE SYMPOSIUM.

EXPERIMENTAL DATA ON STIFFNESS AND SHEAR STRENGTH EVOLUTION WITH SUCTION SUGGEST THAT THE PROPORTION OF SUCTION CONTRIBUTING TO THE EFFECTIVE STRESS IS OFTEN MUCH SMALLER THAN PREDICTED BY THE TERM SUCTION TIMES DEGREE OF SATURATION GENERALLY USED IN EFFECTIVE STRESS EXPRESSIONS OF THE BISHOP TYPE. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT EFFECTIVE STRESS IN UNSATURATED SOILS SHOULD BE RELATED TO SOIL MICROSTRUCTURE. AN EFFECTIVE DEGREE OF SATURATION IS DEFINED AS DESCRIBING THE VOLUME OF WATER PARTIALLY FILLING THE SOIL MACROPOROSITY. THIS EFFECTIVE DEGREE OF SATURATION DEFINES THE PROPORTION OF THE PREVAILING SUCTION THAT ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE EFFECTIVE STRESS. TWO ALTERNATIVE EXPRESSIONS (PIECEWISE LINEAR AND NON LINEAR) ARE PROPOSED FOR THE EFFECTIVE DEGREE OF SATURATION. THEY OFFER A SIMILAR PERFORMANCE. AVAILABLE DATA ON STIFFNESS AND SHEAR STRENGTH VARIATION WITH SUCTION OF A FEW DIFFERENT SOILS, RANGING FROM A MARKEDLY GRANULAR MATERIAL TO HIGH PLASTICITY CLAY, HAVE BEEN ANALYSED. THE ANALYSIS SUPPORTS THE PROPOSED MICROSTRUCTURAL INTERPRETATION OF THE EFFECTIVE STRESS. INDEED, FOR GRANULAR SOILS THE EFFECTIVE DEGREE OF SATURATION IS ALMOST EQUAL TO THE TOTAL DEGREE OF SATURATION, AND THEREFORE THE BISHOP TYPE EXPRESSION GENERALLY USED AS AN EFFECTIVE STRESS IS RECOVERED. AS THE SOIL BECOMES MORE PLASTIC, THE PROPORTION OF FREE WATER REDUCES, AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF SUCTION TO THE EFFECTIVE STRESS REDUCES. AT THE LIMIT, WHEN THE PROPORTION OF FREE WATER IS NEGLIGIBLE (THIS IS THE CASE OF HIGH PLASTICITY CLAYS AT HIGH VALUES OF SUCTION) THE PROPOSED EFFECTIVE STRESS REDUCES TO THE NET STRESS (EXCESS OF TOTAL STRESS OVER THE AIR PRESSURE). THE PROPOSED EFFECTIVE STRESS EQUATION MAY BE IDENTIFIED IF INFORMATION ON THE AMOUNT OF IMMOBILE WATER IS AVAILABLE FOR A GIVEN SOIL. WATER RETENTION OR POROSIMETRY DATA PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION. THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN BY COMPARING THE PRESENT PROPOSAL WITH INDEPENDENTLY OBTAINED INFORMATION ABOUT IMMOBILE WATER IN HIGH PLASTICITY CLAYS.

EXAMPLES OF CLAY CHARACTERISATION ARE GIVEN THAT INCLUDE THE VARIOUS MAIN GEOLOGICAL EVENTS, FROM SEDIMENTATION TO EROSION AND WEATHERING, AND OTHER PHENOMENA SUCH AS DIAGENESIS AND BRECCIATION. THE EXAMPLES DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF PLOTTING BASIC DATA, SUCH AS THE CURRENT STRESS STATE AND UNDRAINED STRENGTH, IN TERMS OF THE VOID INDEX. THESE THREE PARAMETERS PERMIT AN IMMEDIATE, SIMPLE CATEGORISATION, IN TERMS OF GEOLOGICAL HISTORY, OF SEDIMENTARY CLAYS. FURTHER EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATE THE ENGINEERING CONSEQUENCES OF WEATHERING OF STIFF CLAYS, AND THE ASSOCIATED PHENOMENON OF BRECCIATION PRODUCED BY THE PROCESSES OF CAMBERING AND VALLEY BULGING. IT IS EMPHASISED THAT, AT ALL STAGES IN A CLAYS GEOLOGICAL HISTORY, IT IS THE BOND STRENGTH BETWEEN THE SOIL PARTICLES, NOT THE GEOLOGICAL PRECONSOLIDATION STRESS, THAT CONTROLS THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF SEDIMENTARY CLAYS. AT ALL GEOLOGICAL STAGES THE BOND STRENGTH CONTRIBUTES TO SENSITIVITY IN TERMS OF BOTH STRESS STATE AND STRENGTH. THESE SENSITIVITIES ARE MEASURED AGAINST TWO INTRINSIC BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS, THE INTRINSIC COMPRESSION LINE AND THE INTRINSIC STRENGTH LINE, BOTH OF WHICH ARE DEFINED, AND BOTH OF WHICH HAVE CONSIDERABLE VALUE FOR THE CHARACTERISATION OF CLAYS. IN PARTICULAR, THE RELATIONS BETWEEN YIELD STRESS IN OEDOMETER COMPRESSION AND TRIAXIAL UNDRAINED STRENGTH ENABLE THE QUALITY OF LABORATORY TEST DATA TO BE ASSESSED.

THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SOIL BEHAVIOUR TYPE INDEX (IC), EITHER DEFINED BY JEFFERIES AND BEEN (DENOTED HEREIN AS IC,BJ) OR BY ROBERTSON AND WRIDE (DENOTED HEREIN AS IC,RW), IS AN EFFECTIVE PARAMETER FOR MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR CLASSIFICATION. ADDITIONALLY, AN EFFORT IS MADE TO FIND THE MOST SUITABLE IC CUT OFF (OR BOUNDARY) VALUE THAT CAN DELINEATE COHESIONLESS (SAND LIKE) SOILS FROM COHESIVE (CLAY LIKE) SOILS. THE ROBERTSON AND WRIDES FORMULATION, IC,RW 2.67 IS FOUND CAPABLE OF DELINEATING THESE TWO CLASSES OF SOILS. SIMILARLY FOR THE BEEN AND JEFFERIES FORMULATION, IC,BJ 2.58 IS FOUND TO BE THE MOST SUITABLE IC CUT OFF VALUE FOR SUCH CLASSIFICATION PURPOSE. THESE CUT OFF IC VALUES FOR DISTINGUISHING SAND LIKE SOILS FROM CLAY LIKE SOILS ARE FOUND TO BE RELIABLE IN A CASE STUDY OF LIQUEFACTION SUSCEPTIBILITY.

THE INSTRUMENTATION ENABLED RELIABLE ESTIMATES TO BE MADE OF THE VARIATION OF PILE BENDING MOMENTS FROM WHICH OBSERVATIONS ARE MADE RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF LATERAL EARTH PRESSURES. PARTICLE IMAGE VELOCIMETRY WAS EMPLOYED TO OBTAIN A UNIQUE DATASET OF LATERAL AND VERTICAL DISPLACEMENT MEASUREMENTS BEHIND THE WALL, WHICH MAY BE USED TO EVALUATE EXISTING PREDICTIVE APPROACHES FOR ASSESSMENT OF EXCAVATION INDUCED MOVEMENTS. SIMPLE FINITE ELEMENT BACK ANALYSES OF THE EXPERIMENT, EMPLOYING A LINEAR ELASTIC MOHR COULOMB SOIL MODEL, SHOWED THAT MEASURED WALL DISPLACEMENTS AND MOMENTS COULD BE PREDICTED USING EXPECTED EFFECTIVE STRESS STRENGTH PARAMETERS, BUT THAT BEST FIT EQUIVALENT LINEAR OPERATIONAL STIFFNESSES WERE WELL BELOW THOSE COMMONLY ASSUMED IN PRACTICE. CREEP IS SHOWN TO HAVE A CRITICAL EFFECT ON THE DISPLACEMENTS OF THE WALL AND BEHIND THE WALL AND NEEDS TO BE INCORPORATED IN ANY REALISTIC PREDICTIVE APPROACH.

THE SPUDCAN BEARING RESISTANCE PROFILES MEASURED IN MOST OF THE TESTS RECORDED A PEAK RESISTANCE AT A SHALLOW DEPTH WITHIN THE UPPER SAND LAYER, FOLLOWED BY AN ABRUPT POST PEAK REDUCTION IN RESISTANCE CAUSING THE SPUDCAN TO PLUNGE INTO THE UNDERLYING SOFT CLAY. THIS PHENOMENON IS COMMONLY TERMED AS SPUDCAN PUNCH THROUGH HAZARD, WHICH POTENTIALLY LEADS TO SEVERE STRUCTURAL DAMAGE OF JACK UP RIGS IN THE FIELD. THE CENTRIFUGE TEST RESULTS REVEALED THAT THE RATIO OF UPPER SAND LAYER THICKNESS OVER SPUDCAN DIAMETER AND THE RATIO OF BEARING RESISTANCE BETWEEN THE UPPER SAND AND UNDERLYING CLAY AFFECT THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPUDCAN BEARING RESISTANCE. THE LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING DESIGN METHODS, WHICH WERE DERIVED FOR THE ULTIMATE BEARING CAPACITY OF PRE EMBEDDED SHALLOW FOUNDATION TO ASSESS THE SPUDCAN BEARING RESISTANCE DEPTH PROFILE, ARE ALSO IDENTIFIED. IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE PROFILE MAY BE ASSESSED BY FOCUSING ON THREE KEY CHARACTERISTIC BEARING RESISTANCES.

THE FORCES ACTING ON THESE BARRICADES DEPEND ON THE DEGREE OF CONSOLIDATION THAT OCCURS DURING THE BACKFILLING PROCESS. A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF CONSOLIDATION IN A LAYER INCREASING IN THICKNESS OWING TO ONGOING SEDIMENTATION WAS PROPOSED BY GIBSON IN 1958. THIS SOLUTION APPEARS TO BE DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE STOPE BACKFILLING PROCESS, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE LIMITATIONS IN APPLYING IT. USING MATERIAL PROPERTIES FROM TWO MINE SITES, THE APPLICABILITY OF THE GIBSON SOLUTION TO STOPE FILLING IS EXAMINED. IN PARTICULAR, SINCE ONE OF THE BASIC ASSUMPTIONS OF THE GIBSON SOLUTION (THAT CV REMAINS CONSTANT DURING FILLING) IS GENERALLY VIOLATED, THE EFFECT OF HAVING A VARYING CV IS EXPLORED USING NUMERICAL MODELLING. FINALLY, THE LIMITATIONS OF APPLYING THE GIBSON SOLUTION TO THE STOPE BACK FILLING PROBLEM ARE DISCUSSED. THESE RELATE PARTICULARLY TO THE THREE DIMENSIONAL NATURE OF STOPE GEOMETRY AND DRAINAGE (COMPARED WITH THE ASSUMPTION OF ONE DIMENSIONAL CONDITIONS IN THE GIBSON SOLUTION) AND THE FACT THAT CEMENT IS GENERALLY ADDED TO BACKFILL, SUCH THAT THE ANALYSIS HEREIN IS ONLY VALID UP TO THE START OF CEMENT HYDRATION.

THIS PAPER REPORTS THE RESULTS OF AN INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIVE PROJECT IN WHICH A WORLDWIDE HIGH QUALITY DATABASE OF LIGHTLY OVER CONSOLIDATED CLAYS WAS ASSEMBLED AND USED TO EVALUATE RESISTANCE FACTORS FOR THE ESTIMATION OF INTACT AND REMOULDED UNDRAINED SHEAR STRENGTH FROM THE PENETRATION RESISTANCE OF EACH DEVICE. THE DERIVED FACTORS WERE THEN COMPARED WITH EXISTING THEORETICAL SOLUTIONS TO EVALUATE THE INFLUENCE OF PARTICULAR SOIL CHARACTERISTICS. THE OVERALL STATISTICS SHOWED SIMILAR LEVELS OF VARIABILITY OF THE RESISTANCE FACTORS, WITH LOW COEFFICIENTS OF VARIATION, FOR ALL THREE TYPES OF PENETROMETER. HOWEVER, CORRELATIONS OF THE RESISTANCE FACTORS WITH SPECIFIC SOIL CHARACTERISTICS INDICATED THAT THE RESISTANCE FACTORS FOR THE PIEZOCONE WERE MORE INFLUENCED BY SOIL STIFFNESS, OR RIGIDITY INDEX, THAN FOR THE T BAR AND BALL, WHILE THE EFFECT OF STRENGTH ANISOTROPY WAS ONLY APPARENT IN RESPECT OF RESISTANCE FACTORS FOR THE T BAR AND BALL RELATIVE TO SHEAR STRENGTHS MEASURED IN TRIAXIAL COMPRESSION. IN THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE REMOULDED PENETRATION RESISTANCE AND REMOULDED STRENGTH, THE RESISTANCE FACTORS FOR REMOULDED STRENGTH WERE FOUND TO BE HIGHER THAN THOSE FOR INTACT STRENGTH AND WITH A SLIGHT TENDENCY TO INCREASE WITH INCREASING STRENGTH SENSITIVITY BUT INSENSITIVE TO SOIL INDEX PROPERTIES. BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF THE INFLUENCE OF VARIOUS SOIL CHARACTERISTICS, RESISTANCE FACTORS ARE RECOMMENDED FOR THE ESTIMATION OF INTACT AND REMOULDED UNDRAINED SHEAR STRENGTH FROM THE PENETRATION RESISTANCES OF EACH DEVICE FOR SOIL WITH STRENGTH SENSITIVITY LESS THAN SIX.

ACCURATE EVALUATION OF SAMPLE QUALITY IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT IF RELIABLE DESIGN PARAMETERS ARE TO BE DETERMINED. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE USE OF UNCONFINED SHEAR WAVE VELOCITY (V S) AND SUCTION (U R) MEASUREMENTS TO ASSESS SAMPLE QUALITY RAPIDLY IN SOFT CLAY. SAMPLES OF VARYING QUALITY FROM THREE WELL CHARACTERISED SOFT CLAY SITES ARE INITIALLY ASSESSED USING CONVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES, AND THEIR RESULTS COMPARED WITH V S AND U R MEASUREMENTS PERFORMED ON THE SAME SAMPLES. IT IS OBSERVED THAT THE QUALITY OF SAMPLES INDICATED BY THESE MEASUREMENTS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE INFERRED FROM TRADITIONAL DISTURBANCE MEASURES, WITH V S BEING THE MORE RELIABLE INDICATOR. A TENTATIVE EMPIRICALLY DERIVED CRITERION, BASED ON SAMPLES TESTED IN THIS PROJECT, IS PROPOSED TO QUANTIFY SAMPLE DISTURBANCE COMBINING BOTH V S AND U R MEASUREMENTS. FURTHER WORK USING THIS CRITERION ON DIFFERENT MATERIALS IS IMPORTANT SO AS TO TEST ITS USEFULNESS.

AN ADDITIONAL EQUATION IS DERIVED RELATING THE STRAIN RATE PARAMETER IN EVP THEORY TO THE SECONDARY COMPRESSION INDEX. THE DERIVED EQUATIONS ARE USED TO EVALUATE THE RATE SENSITIVE AND DRAINED CREEP RESPONSE OF 20 CLAYS REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE. THE EVALUATION SHOWS STRONG EVIDENCE THAT THE RATE SENSITIVITY AND TIME DEPENDENCY OF CLAY IN COMPRESSION CAN BE DESCRIBED SIMULTANEOUSLY USING THE GENERALIZED EVP THEORY AND POWER LAW. IN ADDITION, THE CONSTITUTIVE PARAMETER GOVERNING RATE SENSITIVITY IN EVP THEORY APPEARS TO BE UNIQUE FOR CONSTANT RATE OF STRAIN TESTS SUCH AS UNDRAINED TRIAXIAL COMPRESSION AND DRAINED OEDOMETER COMPRESSION AS WELL AS STRESS CONTROLLED TESTS SUCH AS DRAINED OEDOMETER CREEP.

PARTICULAR SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING INTERESTS THAT ENCOURAGE STUDIES OF MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF METHANE HYDRATE SOILS INCLUDE SUBMARINE GEOHAZARDS, SUCH AS THE INITIATION OF MARINE LANDSLIDES THROUGH HYDRATE DISSOCIATION, WELLBORE STABILITY AND ESTIMATION OF FUTURE GAS PRODUCTION FROM WELLS. TO STUDY THESE PROBLEMS, A FORMULATION OF A MULTI PHYSICS MODEL OF METHANE HYDRATE FLOW COUPLED TO SOIL DEFORMATION IS DEVELOPED. BY ASSUMING DEFORMABLE POROUS MEDIA (SOIL MATRIX) THAT ACCOMMODATE NON MOVABLE BUT DISSOCIABLE HYDRATE, A TWO PHASE FLOW FORMULATION OF WATER AND METHANE GAS IS SUGGESTED ACCORDING TO DARCYS LAW AND CAPILLARY PRESSURE LAW. A SINGLE PHASE ELASTIC PERFECTLY PLASTIC CONSTITUTIVE MODEL FOR HYDRATE SOIL SEDIMENTS, BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF EFFECTIVE STRESS, IS DEVELOPED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EFFECT OF HYDRATE SATURATION ON MECHANICAL STRENGTH AND STIFFNESS. THE FORMULATION IS INCORPORATED INTO THE EXPLICIT SCHEME OF FINITE DIFFERENCE CODE FLAC BY SOLVING THREE BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS IN PARALLEL. THE CODE IS USED TO SIMULATE THE BEHAVIOUR OF HORIZONTAL UNSUPPORTED AND SUPPORTED WELLS IN HYDRATEBEARING SEDIMENTS UNDER DIFFERENT IN SITU STRESS CONDITIONS DURING METHANE HYDRATE EXTRACTION. AXIAL FORCE, BENDING MOMENT AND WELL DISPLACEMENTS WERE COMPARED FOR SUPPORTED AND UNSUPPORTED WELLS.

THE EMBANKMENT WAS BUILT IN 1993 ON A SOFT NATURAL CLAY DEPOSIT, WHICH EXHIBITS LARGE STRAIN ANISOTROPY, DESTRUCTURATION AND VISCOSITY. THE STUDY IS BASED ON EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTAL DATA FROM TRIAXIAL AND OEDOMETER TESTS ON INTACT AND RECONSTITUTED SOIL SAMPLES WHICH SHED LIGHT ON THE INFLUENCE OF TIME ON MECHANICAL PROPERTIES, INCLUDING TESTING DESIGNED FOR STUDYING SOIL ANISOTROPY AND DESTRUCTURATION. THE INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS IS DONE IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A RECENTLY DEVELOPED ELASTO VISCOPLASTIC MODEL EVPSCLAY1S, WHICH IS USED TO SIMULATE THE SOFT SOIL DEPOSIT COUPLED WITH BIOTS CONSOLIDATION THEORY. THE DETERMINATION OF MODEL PARAMETERS FROM THE TEST RESULTS DEMONSTRATES THAT THE MODEL CAN BE RELATIVELY EASILY USED FOR PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS. USING THESE PARAMETERS, TWO DIMENSIONAL FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSES HAVE BEEN MADE AS LARGE DEFORMATION ANALYSIS. THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN CALCULATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PROPOSED MODEL CAN BE SATISFACTORILY USED TO DESCRIBE THE TIME DEPENDENT BEHAVIOUR OF THE EMBANKMENT ON STRUCTURED CLAY.

EFFECTS OF ACCELERATION, STRAIN RATE AND AGEING ARE EXAMINED IN THE VERY SMALL TO SMALL STRAIN REGION, USING RESULTS FROM TESTS ON RECONSTITUTED LONDON CLAY AND KAOLIN. STATIC MEASUREMENTS OF THE SHEAR MODULUS AT SMALL STRAINS, USING LOCAL INSTRUMENTATION, INDICATE THAT THE SHEAR MODULUS IS RATE INDEPENDENT WHEN THE SOIL IS SUBJECTED TO ELASTIC DEFORMATIONS ONLY. MOST OFTEN, IN PRACTICE, SOIL SPECIMENS ARE LEFT TO REST BETWEEN THE COMPRESSION AND SHEARING STAGES, UNTIL DEFORMATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CREEP BECOME NEGLIGIBLE. THE TESTING STRAIN RATE IMPOSED UPON SHEARING INDUCES A TEMPORARY ACCELERATION OF STRAINS, WHICH RESULTS IN VERY HIGH MEASURED STIFFNESSES. TEST DATA SHOW, HOWEVER, THAT WHEN THE SHEARING AXIAL STRAIN RATE IS OF THE SAME ORDER OF MAGNITUDE AS THAT MEASURED AT THE END OF THE COMPRESSION/CREEP STAGE, THE REMAINING PLASTIC CREEP STRAINS INFLUENCE THE MEASURED STIFFNESS, WHICH IS THEN MEASURED TO BE COMPARATIVELY LOW. TEST DATA ALSO SEEM TO SHOW THAT TEMPORARY STRAIN ACCELERATION MAY HIDE EFFECTS OF RECENT STRESS PATH ROTATION. ADDITIONALLY, BENDER ELEMENT TESTS WERE PERFORMED DURING ISOTROPIC COMPRESSION TESTS WITH CHANGES IN STRESS RATE AND CREEP STAGES. THE DATA INDICATE THAT THE STRAIN RATE AFFECTS THE VALUE OF THE DYNAMIC SHEAR MODULUS OF THE SOIL. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE INCREASE IN DYNAMIC SHEAR MODULUS DURING SHORT TERM CREEP IS CAUSED BY MECHANISMS LINKED TO THE GRADUAL DECREASE IN STRAIN RATE DURING CREEP, BUT FURTHER INVESTIGATION WOULD BE NEEDED TO CLARIFY WHICH PHYSICAL MECHANISMS. A NEW METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR STRAIN RATE IN EVALUATING THE DYNAMIC SHEAR MODULUS OF NORMALLY CONSOLIDATED RECONSTITUTED CLAYS IS FINALLY PROPOSED.

IT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT FOR MONOTONIC SOIL SHEAR, THE RATES OF CHANGE OF THE SHEAR STRESS, EFFECTIVE NORMAL STRESS AND VOID RATIO ARE PROPORTIONAL TO THE APPLIED SHEAR AND EFFECTIVE NORMAL STRESSES WITH THE PROPORTIONALITY VALUES DECAYING WITH STRAIN TO BECOME ZERO AT THE STEADY STATE CONDITION. THIS HYPOTHESIS PROVIDES CLOSE FITS TO STRESS STRAIN VOID RATIO CURVES FROM UNDRAINED SHEAR TESTS OF UNCEMENTED, RESEDIMENTED CLAYS AND DRAINED SHEAR TESTS OF UNCEMENTED SANDS AND SILTS, USING TRIAXIAL AND TRUETRIAXIAL EQUIPMENT, AND VARIOUS STRESS PATHS. FOR UNDRAINED SHEAR, MODEL PARAMETERS VARY SMOOTHLY WITH OVER CONSOLIDATION RATIO; FOR DRAINED SHEAR, THEY VARY IN AN ORDERLY WAY WITH RELATIVE DENSITY.

M., DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, UNIVERSITE LAVAL, QUEBEC, CANADA	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE INFLUENCE OF SEVERAL FREEZE THAW CYCLES ON THE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY CHANGES OF A GLACIAL TILL FROM PERIBONKA IN QUEBEC, CANADA. SAMPLES RECONSTITUTED BY CONSOLIDATION OF A SLURRY AND BY COMPACTION AT DRY OF OPTIMUM CONDITIONS WERE SUBJECTED TO CLOSED FREEZING AND THAW AS WELL AS CONSTANT HEAD PERMEABILITY TESTS. FOR SATURATED CONSOLIDATED SAMPLES, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LOGARITHM OF HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY AND VOID RATIO WAS LINEAR FOR BOTH UNFROZEN AND THAWED STATES. AT A GIVEN VOID RATIO, THE INCREASE OF THE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY OF THE THAWED SOIL WAS LARGER FOR COMPACTED AND UNSATURATED SAMPLES THAN FOR SATURATED CONSOLIDATED SAMPLES. ACTUAL FREEZE THAW INDUCED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY CHANGES, HOWEVER, MAY BE OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN VOID RATIO DURING THAW CONSOLIDATION.

FOUR HORIZONTAL BORE HOLES WERE INSTALLED AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS BELOW A BALLASTED RAILWAY TRACK. GROUND DEFORMATIONS WERE MEASURED USING GEOPHONES AT SET DISTANCES FROM THE CENTRELINE OF THE TRACK WITHIN EACH BOREHOLE. THE RESULTS SHOW VERTICAL DISPLACEMENTS REDUCING WITH DEPTH, FROM A MAXIMUM AT THE SLEEPER. SLEEPER DISPLACEMENTS ARE DOMINATED BY PAIRS OF BOGIES AT THE ENDS OF ADJACENT WAGONS (WHICH HAVE A FREQUENCY OF LOADING 1 HZ), ALTHOUGH THE EFFECTS OF INDIVI DUAL BOGIES (2 HZ) AND AXLES (6 HZ) ARE ALSO APPARENT. HIGHER LOADING FREQUENCIES ATTENUATE WITH DEPTH SO THAT AT A DEPTH OF 0.780 M BELOW THE SLEEPER SOFFIT NO AXLES ARE VISIBLE WITHIN THE DISPLACEMENT DATA AND BY A DEPTH OF 1.98 M ONLY THE COMBINED EFFECT OF PAIRS OF ADJACENT BOGIES IS APPARENT. IN CONTRAST, LONGITUDINAL HORIZONTAL MOTION IS GREATEST AT A DEPTH OF 0.78 M BELOW THE SLEEPER SOFFIT, AND THE LONGITUDINAL HORIZONTAL DISPLACEMENTS AT THE SLEEPER AND AT A DEPTH OF 0.78 M ARE DOMINATED BY THE INDIVIDUAL AXLES (~6 HZ). BY A DEPTH OF 1.98 M, THE LONGITUDINAL HORIZONTAL MOTION IS DOMINATED BY THE BOGIE PAIRS. A DYNAMIC LINEAR ELASTIC TWO DIMENSIONAL FINITE ELEMENT MODEL WAS DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED USING THE MEASURED DISPLACEMENTS.

J., ECOLE DES PONTS, PARISTECH, CHAMPS SUR MARNE, FRANCE	OEDOMETER TESTS STARTING FROM A VERY SMALL EFFECTIVE VERTICAL STRESS OF 0.5 KPA WERE PERFORMED ON THREE RECONSTITUTED CLAYS WITH DIFFERENT LIQUID LIMITS. THE SOILS WERE PREPARED AT VARIOUS INITIAL WATER CONTENTS, RANGING FROM 0.7 TO 2.0 TIMES THEIR CORRESPONDING LIQUID LIMITS. IT IS OBSERVED THAT THE E LOG V COMPRESSION CURVES SHOW AN INVERSE S SHAPE DUE TO SUCTION PRESSURE RESISTING DEFORMATION, SIMILAR TO THAT OF SOFT NATURAL CLAYS CAUSED BY CONSOLIDATION YIELD STRESS. THE SUCTION PRESSURE S OF THE RECONSTITUTED CLAYS CAN BE CORRELATED WITH THE RATIO OF INITIAL VOID RATIO TO VOID RATIO AT LIQUID LIMIT E0/EL. THE SUCTION PRESSURE CURVE DEFINED BY A UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUCTION PRESSURE S AND THE NORMALISED VOID RATIO AT SUCTION PRESSURE ES/EL IS ALSO PROPOSED TO DISTIN GUISH BETWEEN THE PRE SUCTION AND THE POST SUCTION STATES. IN ADDITION, BURLANDS CONCEPT OF THE INTRINSIC COMPRES SION LINE IS ADOPTED FOR CORRELATING THE COMPRESSION CURVES OF VARIOUS RECONSTITUTED CLAYS AT HIGH INITIAL WATER CONTENTS. IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT THE VOID INDEX IS A POWERFUL PARAMETER FOR NORMALISING THE COMPRESSION CURVES IN THE POST SUCTION STATE. NEVERTHELESS, IT SEEMS THAT BURLANDS INTRINSIC COMPRESSION LINE SLIGHTLY UNDER ESTIMATES THE VOID INDEX AT THE LOW STRESSES CONSIDERED IN THIS STUDY. AN EXTENDED INTRINSIC COMPRESSION LINE IS THEN DERIVED IN ORDER TO BETTER FIT THE DATA FOR STRESSES LOWER THAN 25 KPA.

S., DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, KYUNGPOOK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, DAEGU, SOUTH KOREA	A SAND CONE METHOD IS COMMONLY USED TO DETERMINE THE DENSITY OF COMPACTED SOILS. THE DENSITY OF THE COMPACTED SOIL CALCULATED FROM THE SAND CONE METHOD COULD BE CORRECT, PROVIDED THE CALIBRATION CONTAINER HAS APPROXIMATELY THE SAME SIZE OR VOLUME AND ALLOWS THE SAND TO FALL TO APPROXIMATELY THE SAME HEIGHT AS A TEST HOLE IN THE FIELD. HOWEVER, IN MOST CASES, THE SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE TEST HOLE IS NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AS THAT OF THE CALIBRATION CONTAINER. THIS CAN RESULT IN A DIFFERENCE IN THE SETTLEMENT OR DEPOSITION OF SAND PARTICLES BETWEEN THE LABORATORY CALIBRATION AND THE FIELD TESTING, WHICH MAY CAUSE AN ERRONEOUS DETERMINATION OF THE IN SITU DENSITY. THE SAND FILLING PROCESS IS SIMULATED IN THE LABORATORY AND ITS EFFECT ON THE DETERMINATION OF DENSITY IS INVESTIGATED. ARTIFICIALLY MADE HOLES WITH DIFFERENT DEPTHS AND BOTTOM SHAPES ARE PREPARED TO SIMULATE VARIOUS SHAPES OF THE TEST HOLE IN THE FIELD. SANDS WITH DIFFERENT PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS ARE USED IN THE TESTING TO EXAMINE HOW SAND GRAIN SIZE INFLUENCES THE DETERMINATION OF DENSITY IN THE FIELD. THE ERROR BETWEEN THE ASSUMED AND CALCULATED DENSITIES IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE TYPES OF SAND USED IN THE SAND CONE METHOD. THIS PAPER PRESENTS SOME GUIDELINES FOR OBTAINING CORRECT IN SITU DENSITIES THROUGH THE SAND CONE METHOD.

THIS URL IS DEVOTED TO RESEARCH INTO NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL. THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF AN INVESTIGATION CARRIED OUT IN THE TRIAXIAL APPARATUS ON SPECIMENS THAT WERE TRIMMED FROM BLOCKS EXTRACTED DURING EXCAVATION SEQUENCES IN THE URL. IN ORDER TO CHARACTERISE THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF THE NATURAL BOOM CLAY AND TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF INITIAL AND INDUCED ANISOTROPY ON ITS CONSTITUTIVE BEHAVIOUR, TWO SERIES OF TRIAXIAL TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT. SPECIAL ATTENTION WAS DEVOTED TO THE YIELD BEHAVIOUR AND THE EFFECTS OF STRESS HISTORY. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOWED A CLEAR RELATION BETWEEN THE SHAPE OF YIELD CURVES AND STRESS HISTORY. THE YIELD CURVE OF THE CLAY IN ITS INITIAL STATE WAS ORIENTED ALONG THE K0 LINE, ILLUSTRATING THE ANISOTROPY OF FABRIC THAT WAS GENERATED DURING THE SOIL DEPOSITION. SUBSEQUENT ISOTROPIC COMPRESSION (UP TO 9 MPA) MADE THE YIELD CURVE MORE AND MORE ORIENTED ALONG THE P9 AXIS. BASED ON THESE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS, AN ELASTO PLASTIC MODEL ACCOUNTING FOR ISOTROPIC AND ANISOTROPIC HARDENING IN (P9:Q) SPACE WAS DEVELOPED. THE INITIAL YIELD CURVE OF THE SOIL WAS TAKEN INCLINED WITH RESPECT TO THE P9 AXIS. THE FORMULATION PROPOSED DESCRIBES THE CHANGE IN SHAPE, SIZE AND ORIENTATION OF THE YIELD CURVE, ACCORDING TO THE STRESS HISTORY. EIGHT CONSTITUTIVE PARA METERS WERE USED TO DESCRIBE THE ANISOTROPIC BEHAVIOUR OF THE SOIL.

THE MODEL IS BASED ON A STRAIN SUPERPOSITION RULE SIMILAR TO MINERS RULE AND USES RAINFLOW COUNTING TO DECOMPOSE A RANDOM TIME SERIES OF VARYING LOADS INTO A SET OF SIMPLE LOAD REVERSALS. THE METHOD IS CONSISTENT WITH THE WORK OF LEBLANC ET AL. (2010) AND IS SUPPORTED BY 1G LABORATORY TESTS.

THE METHOD, DERIVED FROM COULOMBS THEORY, CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR THE EFFECT OF COHESION AND HENCE CANNOT BE USED FOR A COHESIVE BACKFILL. IN ADDITION, THE EFFECT OF WALL ADHESION AND EXTERNAL LOAD CANNOT BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. THIS PAPER DEVELOPS A NEW GENERAL FORMULA FOR DYNAMIC ACTIVE EARTH PRESSURE ON A YIELDING WALL. THE STRENGTH OF THE FORMULA IS THAT IT CAN TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE EFFECTS OF COHESION, WALL ADHESION AND EXTERNAL LOAD ON DYNAMIC ACTIVE PRESSURE, WHILE REMAINING SIMPLE IN FORM. THE DYNAMIC EARTH PRESSURES CALCULATED BY THE PROPOSED FORMULA, THE MONONOBE OKABE METHOD, AND THE GRAPHICAL SOLUTION ARE COMPARED FOR VALIDATION. THE COMPARISONS DEMONSTRATE THE ACCURACY OF THE PROPOSED FORMULA. THE FORMULA IS USED IN A PARAMETRIC STUDY TO INVESTIGATE THE INFLUENCE OF COHESION, WALL ADHESION AND EXTERNAL LOAD. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT THE ADDITIONAL TERMS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE CALCULATED DYNAMIC ACTIVE EARTH PRESSURE.

A PRIMARY REASON FOR THIS DISPARITY IS CONSIDERED TO BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ANISOTROPIC PROPERTIES OF THE SOIL SPECIMENS TESTED AS A RESULT OF PREPARATION USING ONEDIMENSIONAL COMPACTION. AS PART OF THE WORK PRESENTED, COMPARISON IS MADE BETWEEN TESTS ON SAMPLES OF UNSATURATED KAOLIN PREPARED AT IDENTICAL SPECIFIC VOLUMES AND SPECIFIC WATER VOLUMES USING ISOTROPIC COMPRESSION AND ONE DIMENSIONAL COMPRESSION. THE SUCTIONS IN THE SAMPLES WERE REDUCED TO PREDEFINED VALUES BY WETTING UNDER LOW ISOTROPIC LOADING IN A TRIAXIAL CELL. THE SAMPLES WERE THEN TAKEN THROUGH VARIOUS STRESS PATHS TO FAILURE, DEFINED AS THE CRITICAL STATE STRENGTH, WHILE THE SUCTIONS WERE HELD CONSTANT. STRESS PATH TESTS WERE ALSO PERFORMED ON SAMPLES WITHOUT REDUCING THE SUCTION TO PREDEFINED VALUES. IN THE LATTER, CONSTANT WATER MASS TESTS, THE SUCTIONS WERE ALLOWED TO VARY AND WERE MEASURED USING A PSYCHROMETER. THE RESULTS OF THE TESTS AT CRITICAL STATE ARE COMPARED WITH THE PROPOSITIONS OF WHEELER AND SIVAKUMAR. THE SHEAR STRENGTHS OF SAMPLES WITH ISOTROPIC PREVIOUS HISTORY ARE SHOWN TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THOSE OF SAMPLES WITH ONE DIMENSIONAL STRESS HISTORY WHEN PLOTTED AGAINST THE MEAN NET STRESS. THE NORMAL COMPRESSION LINES, CRITICAL STATE LINES AND YIELD CHARACTERISTICS ARE ALSO SHOWN TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY THE PREVIOUS STRESS HISTORY AND ARE SHOWN TO BE DIFFERENT FOR ISOTROPICALLY AND ONE DIMENSIONALLY PREPARED SAMPLES.

THE MOST PRONOUNCED EFFECT OF THE PRESENCE OF INFILL MATERIAL IS THE REDUCTION IN FRICTION OF THE DISCONTINUITY BOUNDARIES (I.E. ROCK TO ROCK CONTACT OF THE JOINT WALLS). THE THICKER THE INFILL, THE SMALLER THE SHEAR STRENGTH OF THE ROCK JOINT. ONCE THE INFILL REACHES A CRITICAL THICKNESS, THE JOINT WALLS (ROCK) PLAY NO SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE OVERALL SHEAR STRENGTH. SEVERAL MODELS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO PREDICT THE PEAK SHEAR STRENGTH OF INFILLED JOINTS UNDER BOTH CONSTANT NORMAL LOAD AND CONSTANT NORMAL STIFFNESS BOUNDARY CONDITIONS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE RATIO OF INFILL THICKNESS (T) TO THE HEIGHT OF THE JOINT WALL ASPERITY (A), THAT IS THE T/A RATIO. MODELS BASED ON THE CONSTANT NORMAL STIFFNESS CONDITION PROVIDE A MUCH MORE ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF THE INFILLED JOINT BEHAVIOUR IN THE FIELD, BUT ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE MORE REALISTIC CONSTANT NORMAL STIFFNESS STRESS STRAIN BEHAVIOUR. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A CRITICAL REVIEW OF SOME OF THE EARLIER STUDIES AND THE MOST RECENT ADVANCEMENT OF A SHEAR STRENGTH MODEL DEVELOPED AT UNIVERSITY OF WOLLONGONG, AUSTRALIA, SUPPLEMENTED WITH LABORATORY DATA FOR MODEL VALIDATION. THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS ON THE SHEAR BEHAVIOUR SUCH AS THE T/A RATIO, INFILL FRICTION ANGLE, JOINT WALL ROUGHNESS, JOINT STIFFNESS AND TYPE OF INFILL ARE PRESENTED.

IN THIS PAPER A RECENTLY DEVELOPED THERMOMECHANICAL PROCEDURE IS USED TO DERIVE CONSTITUTIVE MODELS FOR SANDS UNDERGOING TRIAXIAL DEFORMATIONS. THE WELL KNOWN GEOMECHANICAL STATE PARAMETER IS GIVEN A NEW SIGNIFICANCE AND IS TAKEN AS THE FUNDAMENTAL THERMOMECHANICAL STATE PARAMETER. THE LOGARITHM OF THE SPECIFIC VOLUME IS SHOWN TO BE THE PLASTIC VOLUME STRAIN, AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE LOGARITHM OF THE EFFECTIVE PRESSURE IS SHOWN TO BE FRACTAL. IN ADDITION THE SHEAR INDUCED VOLUME STRAINS, CHARACTERISTIC OF GRANULAR MATERIALS, ARE INTRODUCED VIA A WORKLESS CONSTRAINT, AND THE RESULTING DEFORMATION IS SEEN TO EXHIBIT INDUCED ANISOTROPY AUTOMATICALLY. THE ASSOCIATED REACTION STRESS TENSOR IS SHOWN TO BE IDENTICAL WITH THE EXTANT FABRIC TENSOR. THE PLASTIC FLOW RULE IS SHOWN TO BE NECESSARILY NON ASSOCIATED. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTAL DATA IS MADE, TOGETHER WITH SOME DISCUSSION OF THE MODELS RELATION TO THE PREDICTIONS OF DISTINCT ELEMENT SIMULATIONS.

RESEARCH USING CONSTITUTIVE MODELLING HAS EXTENDED THE CRITICAL STATE FRAMEWORK AND THE CONCEPT OF YIELDING IN SATURATED SOILS TO ENCOMPASS UNSATURATED SOILS EXPERIENCING SUCTION. HOWEVER, VALIDATION TESTING OF THE FRAMEWORK FOR UNSATURATED SOILS HAS SHOWN DISAGREEMENT WITH THE BASIC PROPOSITIONS. THE MAIN REASON FOR THIS DISPARITY IS THE ANISOTROPIC PROPERTIES OF THE SOIL SPECIMENS TESTED AS A RESULT OF PREPARATION USING ONE DIMENSIONAL COMPACTION. THE PAPER DESCRIBES THE DETAILED TESTING CARRIED OUT TO JUSTIFY THIS STATEMENT. AS PART OF THE WORK PRESENTED, SAMPLES OF UNSATURATED KAOLIN WERE PREPARED USING ISOTROPIC COMPRESSION. THE SUCTIONS IN THESE SAMPLES WERE REDUCED TO PREDEFINED VALUES BY WETTING UNDER LOW ISOTROPIC LOADING. THE PORE SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS, THE PRESSURE VOLUME RELATIONSHIPS AND YIELDING UNDER SUBSEQUENT ISOTROPIC LOADING ARE COMPARED WITH TESTS ON SAMPLES PREPARED BY STATICALLY COMPRESSING KAOLIN INTO A ONE DIMENSIONAL COMPACTION MOULD. THE ANISOTROPICALLY COMPRESSED SAMPLES HAD INITIAL WATER CONTENTS AND SPECIFIC VOLUMES SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE ISOTROPICALLY PREPARED SAMPLES AND WERE ALSO TESTED UNDER REDUCING SUCTIONS; THEY EXHIBITED DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT BEHAVIOUR WHEN TESTED UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS. THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE ISOTROPICALLY PREPARED AND TESTED SAMPLES HAVE SHOWN, PROBABLY FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE EXISTENCE OF A UNIQUE NORMAL COMPRESSION SURFACE THAT IS NOT DEPENDENT ON THE INITIAL CONDITIONS OF THE SAMPLES. THE SHAPE OF THE LOADING COLLAPSE (LC) YIELD LOCUS IS SHOWN TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED FORM.

A GROUNDWATER MODEL FOR THE HS1 CHANNEL TUNNEL RAIL LINK THAMES TUNNEL SOUTHERN APPROACH EXCAVATION IS USED TO SHOW THAT THE OBSERVED PERFORMANCE OF THE CONSTRUCTION DEWATERING SYSTEM CANNOT ADEQUATELY BE EXPLAINED UNLESS SUCH FEATURES ARE INCORPORATED. WHILE EXPERIENCE SUGGESTED THAT SUCH FEATURES WERE LIKELY TO BE PRESENT IN THIS GEOLOGICAL SETTING, AT THE DESIGN STAGE THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THEIR SCALE. GROUNDWATER FLOW MODELING ENABLED THE LOCATION AND EXTENT OF THE INHOMOGENEITIES PRESENT TO BE DEDUCED IN SOME DETAIL. FEATURES SUCH AS HIGHLY PERMEABLE ZONES MIGHT BE IDENTIFIED BY MORE THOROUGH SITE INVESTIGATION, INCLUDING THE MORE WIDESPREAD USE OF PUMPING TESTS. HOWEVER, THE INFLUENCE OF ANISOTROPY IS HARDER TO ESTABLISH, PRIMARILY BECAUSE ITS EFFECT IS MOST SIGNIFICANT ONCE A HORIZONTAL FLOW BARRIER (FOR EXAMPLE, A RETAINING WALL) IS IN PLACE, WHICH IS GENERALLY NOT THE CASE DURING SITE INVESTIGATION.

THE THERMAL EFFECTS WERE IDENTIFIED BY COMPARING THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS OF CYCLIC TRIAXIAL TESTS PERFORMED AT HIGH TEMPERATURE (90C) WITH RESULTS OF THE SAME TYPE OF TEST CARRIED OUT AT AMBIENT TEMPERATURE (22C). FOR THE TESTING, A NEW TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED TRIAXIAL APPARATUS, DEVELOPED BY THE AUTHORS, WAS EMPLOYED. EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT SHEAR CYCLES ON THE HEATED SAMPLES INDUCED SMALLER AXIAL STRAIN AND PORE WATER PRESSURE PER CYCLE IN COMPARISON WITH THE UNHEATED SAMPLES. IN ADDITION, SHEAR INDUCED PORE WATER PRESSURE AT LARGE STRAINS IN THE HEATED SAMPLE WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN IN THE UNHEATED SAMPLE. IN OTHER WORDS, THE HEATED SAMPLES BEHAVED AS IF THEY WERE DENSER, WHICH IS A RESULT OF THERMAL HARDENING. THESE RESULTS MAY BE APPLIED IN GEOTECHNICAL AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS AS A SOIL IMPROVEMENT TECHNIQUE.

THESE TESTS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND USED TO EXPLORE CERTAIN CONSTITUTIVE CONJECTURES CONCERNING THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF GRANULAR MATERIALS. THE RESULTS, WITHIN THE ACCURACY OF THE APPARATUS, SHOW THAT IRRESPECTIVE OF THE INITIAL STRESS HISTORY OF THE MATERIAL, PROPORTIONAL STRAIN PATHS (IF CONTINUED FOR LONG ENOUGH) LEAD TO PROPORTIONAL STRESS STATES (ASYMPTOTIC STATES). THE ASYMPTOTIC STATES APPEAR TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THE FIXED IMPOSED ROTATION OF PRINCIPAL STRAIN AXES AND AT THESE STATES COAXIALITY BETWEEN THE PRINCIPAL STRESS DIRECTION AND THE PRINCIPAL INCREMENTAL STRAIN DIRECTION SEEMS TO BE REACHED. A STRESS DILATANCY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE IMPOSED DILATANCY AND THE CORRESPONDING ASYMPTOTIC STRESS RATIO HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED.

KUMAR J., MADHUSUDHAN B.N.	EFFECT OF RELATIVE DENSITY AND CONFINING PRESSURE ON POISSON RATIO FROM BENDER AND EXTENDER ELEMENTS TESTS	2010	GEOTECHNIQUE	60	7		561	567		7	HTTP://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URL?EID2 S2.0 77953529309&PARTNERID40&MD569FD065813DECA70DB813544D9ADC73B	DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, INDIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE, BANGALORE 560012, INDIA	KUMAR, J., DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, INDIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE, BANGALORE 560012, INDIA; MADHUSUDHAN, B.N., DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, INDIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE, BANGALORE 560012, INDIA	BY USING THE BENDER AND EXTENDER ELEMENTS TESTS, TOGETHER WITH MEASUREMENTS OF THE TRAVEL TIMES OF SHEAR (S) AND PRIMARY (P) WAVES, THE VARIATION OF POISSON RATIO (NI) WAS DETERMINED FOR DRY SANDS WITH RESPECT TO CHANGES IN RELATIVE DENSITIES AND EFFECTIVE CONFINING PRESSURES (SIGMA3). THE TESTS WERE PERFORMED FOR THREE DIFFERENT RANGES OF PARTICLE SIZES. THE MAGNITUDE OF THE POISSON RATIO DECREASES INVARIABLY WITH AN INCREASE IN BOTH THE RELATIVE DENSITY AND THE EFFECTIVE CONFINING PRESSURE. THE EFFECT OF THE CONFINING PRESSURE ON THE POISSON RATIO WAS FOUND TO BECOME RELATIVELY MORE SIGNIFICANT FOR FINE GRAINED SAND AS COMPARED WITH THE COARSE GRAINED SAND. FOR A GIVEN MATERIAL, AT A PARTICULAR VALUE OF SIGMA3, THE MAGNITUDE OF THE POISSON RATIO DECREASES, ALMOST IN A LINEAR FASHION, WITH AN INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF MAXIMUM SHEAR MODULUS (GMAX). THE TWO WIDELY USED CORRELATIONS IN LITERATURE, PROVIDING THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG GMAX, VOID RATIO (E) AND EFFECTIVE CONFINING PRESSURE (SIGMA3), APPLICABLE FOR ANGULAR GRANULAR MATERIALS, WERE FOUND TO COMPARE REASONABLY WELL WITH THE PRESENT EXPERIMENTAL DATA FOR THE FINEAND MEDIUM GRAINED SANDS. HOWEVER, FOR THE COARSEGRAINED SAND, THESE CORRELATIONS TEND TO OVERESTIMATE THE VALUES OF GMAX.

THIS PAPER REPORTS THE RESULTS OF A SERIES OF RESONANT COLUMN TESTS CARRIED OUT ON A RANGE OF SANDSIZED GEOMATERIALS TO EXPLORE THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT HYDRATE CEMENT MORPHOLOGIES ON THE VERY SMALL STRAIN STIFFNESS OF THE MATERIALS. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE PROPORTION OF VOID SPACE FILLED BY HYDRATE CEMENT, CEMENT LOCATION, SAND SIZE AND GRAIN SHAPE ALL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON SHEAR MODULUS. THE CHANGE IN STIFFNESS BETWEEN DIFFERENT HOST MATERIALS IS AFFECTED BY THE DENSITY, SPECIFIC SURFACE AND GRADING OF THE GEOMATERIAL.

THE BULK OF THE CLUMP IS FORMED FROM TEN BALLS IN A TETRAHEDRAL SHAPE. THE INTERLOCKING AND BREAKING OF VERY SMALL ASPERITIES WHICH FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE VOIDS IS MODELLED USING WEAK PARALLEL BONDS BETWEEN CLUMPS. THE INTERLOCKING AND FRACTURE OF LARGER ASPERITIES HAS BEEN MODELLED BY BONDING EIGHT SMALL BALLS TO THE CLUMP. MONOTONIC TESTS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED ON TRIAXIAL SAMPLES UNDER A RANGE OF CONFINING PRESSURES FROM 15 KPA TO 240 KPA AND THE RESULTS COMPARED WITH EXISTING EXPERIMENTAL DATA. TESTS WERE ALSO SIMULATED USING UNCRUSHABLE CLUMPS TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF ASPERITY ABRASION. CYCLIC TRIAXIAL TESTS WERE THEN SIMULATED ON THE SAME AGGREGATES USING THE SAME MICROPARAMETERS AS THE MONOTONIC TESTS UNDER A RANGE OF STRESS CONDITIONS AND THE RESULTS WERE COMPARED TO EXISTING EXPERIMENTAL DATA FOR THE SAME SIMULATED BALLAST. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE CLUMPS ARE ABLE TO CAPTURE THE BEHAVIOUR OF BALLAST UNDER BOTH MONOTONIC AND CYCLIC CONDITIONS AND ASPERITY ABRASION IS SHOWN TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN GOVERNING STRENGTH AND VOLUMETRIC STRAIN UNDER MONOTONIC LOADING, AND ON PERMANENT STRAINS UNDER CYCLIC LOADING. THE NEW CONTRIBUTION IS THEREFORE TO SHOW THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO MODEL A REAL GRANULAR MATERIAL UNDER STATIC AND CYCLIC CONDITIONS, THUS PROVIDING MUCH MICROMECHANICAL INSIGHT.

GLASS BALLOTINI WERE USED AS AN ANALOGUE SOIL; THEIR RELATIVELY SIMPLE GEOMETRY ALLOWED THE INFLUENCE OF PARTICLE SHAPE AND INTER PARTICLE FRICTION TO BE EXAMINED INDEPENDENTLY. TECHNIQUES WERE DEVELOPED TO CONTROL THE SURFACE ROUGHNESS OF THE BALLOTINI TO FACILITATE A PARAMETRIC STUDY. THE PARTICLE SHAPE WAS ALSO VARIED BY CRUSHING THE BALLOTINI. AT THE MICRO SCALE, THE PARTICLE CHARACTERISATION INCLUDED ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS OF INTER PARTICLE FRICTION, CONTACT STIFFNESS, PARTICLE SURFACE ROUGHNESS AND PARTICLE SHAPE. AT THE MACRO SCALE THE SENSITIVITY OF OVERALL MATERIAL RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN SURFACE ROUGHNESS AND GEOMETRY WAS CHARACTERISED USING TRIAXIAL TESTS AND OEDOMETER TESTS ON SMOOTH SPHERICAL BALLOTINI, ROUGHENED BALLOTINI AND CRUSHED ANGULAR BALLOTINI. COMPRESSION TESTS INDICATED THAT THE INITIAL LOAD DEFORMATION RESPONSE AT PARTICLE PARTICLE CONTACT POINTS IS SIGNIFICANTLY SOFTER THAN PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED. OPTICAL INTERFEROMETRY OF PARTICLES AFTER SINGLE PARTICLE PARTICLE SHEARING TESTS CONFIRMED THAT PLASTIC STRAINS OCCURRED AT THE CONTACT POINT, WHICH WERE RELATED TO PLASTIC YIELD. A HERTZIAN RESPONSE WAS ONLY SEEN AT HIGHER CONTACT LOADS. A CLEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INTER PARTICLE FRICTION AND THE PARTICLE SURFACE ROUGHNESS WAS FOUND. HOWEVER, THE MACRO SCALE EXPERIMENTS INDICATED THAT WHILE THE MATERIAL RESPONSE MAY BE SLIGHTLY DEPENDENT ON THE SURFACE ROUGHNESS AND FRICTION, THE INFLUENCE OF PARTICLE SHAPE IS VERY MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT.

SOIL STIFFNESS IS REPRESENTED BY A PAIR OF VALUES OF LINEAR SPRING STIFFNESS NORMAL AND TANGENTIAL TO EACH INTERGRANULAR CONTACT, AND THE LIMITING COEFFICIENT OF CONTACT FRICTION IS DESCRIBED AS VARYING LINEARLY WITH THE LOGARITHM OF SLIDING VELOCITY. DEM SIMULATIONS OF AN ASSEMBLY OF 3451 SPHERES REPRODUCE A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT PHENOMENA INCLUDING: CREEP RATE AS A FUNCTION OF THE MOBILISATION OF DEVIATORIC STRESS; INITIALLY LINEAR DECAY OF CREEP STRAIN RATE WITH TIME PLOTTED ON LOG LOG AXES AND WITH A SLOPE M IN THE RANGE 20.8 TO 21; AND ULTIMATE CREEP FAILURE IN TRIAXIAL SIMULATIONS AT HIGH DEVIATORIC STRESS RATIOS. CREEP INDUCED FAILURE IS SHOWN TO OCCUR AT A UNIQUE AXIAL STRAIN FOR A GIVEN STATE OF INITIAL PACKING, AND TO BE LINKED WITH DILATANCY. THE NUMERICAL RESULTS ARE COMPARED QUANTITATIVELY WITH THE TEST DATA OF SOILS FROM THE LITERATURE. THE EFFECTS OF ACTIVATION ENERGY ARE CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO THE DIFFERENT MAGNITUDES OF CREEP ENCOUNTERED IN SANDS AND CLAYS.

SOIL SPECIMENS ARE REPRESENTED BY AN ASSEMBLY OF NON UNIFORM SIZED SPHERICAL PARTICLES. DEM SPECIMENS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT INITIAL CONTACT NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS WERE PREPARED AT TWO DIFFERENT DENSITIES (LOOSE AND DENSE) AND THEN ISOTROPICALLY CONSOLIDATED TRIAXIAL TESTS WERE SIMULATED WITH THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS: (A) DIFFERENT DRAINAGE CONDITIONS (UNDRAINED/DRAINED), (B) DIFFERENT MODES OF SHEARING (COMPRESSION/EXTENSION), AND (C) DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OF SHEARING (VERTICAL/HORIZONTAL). THE NUMERICAL ANALYSIS RESULTS ARE COMPARED QUALITATIVELY WITH THE OBSERVED EXPERIMENTAL DATA AND THE EFFECTS OF INITIAL SOIL FABRIC ON RESULTING SOIL BEHAVIOURS ARE DISCUSSED. THE DISCUSSIONS INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF SPECIMEN RECONSTITUTION METHODS, EFFECTS OF LARGE PRESHEARING, AND ANISOTROPIC CHARACTERISTICS IN DRAINED AND UNDRAINED CONDITIONS. THE EFFECTS OF INITIAL SOIL FABRIC ON THE QUASI STEADY STATE ARE ALSO INVESTIGATED. THE NUMERICAL ANALYSIS RESULTS CAN SYSTEMATICALLY EXPLAIN THAT THE OBSERVED EXPERIMENTAL BEHAVIOURS OF SAND ARE DUE PRINCIPALLY TO THE EFFECTS OF INITIAL SOIL FABRIC. THE OUTCOME PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO THE OBSERVED PHENOMENA IN MICROSCOPIC VIEW.

DEVELOPMENT OF A CONTINUUM MODEL FOR THE MECHANICAL CONSEQUENCES OF EROSION HAS TAKEN INSPIRATION FROM TWODIMENSIONAL DISCRETE ELEMENT ANALYSES OF ASSEMBLIES OF CIRCULAR DISCS OF VARIOUS GRADINGS. THE PROCESS OF EROSION HAS BEEN DESCRIBED IN THESE ANALYSES BY PROGRESSIVELY REMOVING THE FINER PARTICLES WHILE MAINTAINING THE SAMPLE UNDER CONSTANT STRESSES. THE REMOVAL OF PARTICLES PRODUCES AN INCREASE IN SPECIFIC VOLUME BECAUSE THE VOLUME OF SOLID DECREASES AND THE VOLUME OF VOID INCREASES, BUT THE LOOSER STRUCTURE COMPRESSES UNDER THE EXTERNAL STRESSES. PARALLEL CONTINUUM MODELLING TAKES AN EXISTING DISTORTIONAL HARDENING MODEL, IN WHICH THE CRITICAL STATE LINE PLAYS A CENTRAL ROLE, AND ADDS A VOLUMETRIC DEFORMATION MECHANISM TO DESCRIBE THE OBSERVED COMPRESSION. THE DISCRETE ELEMENT MODELLING ANALYSES AND OTHER RESULTS REMIND US THAT THE FIRST ORDER EFFECT OF NARROWING GRADING IS THE RAISING OF THE CRITICAL STATE LINE IN THE COMPRESSION PLANE. THE MODEL IS CLOSELY SIMILAR TO A MODEL FOR SOILS WITH BREAKABLE PARTICLES, INCORPORATING THE SAME LINK BETWEEN GRADING AND CRITICAL STATES.

THE SITUATION IS DIFFERENT FOR CLAYS BECAUSE THE ELEMENTARY UNIT AND THE INTER UNIT INTERACTIONS AT THE MICRO SCALE ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO CHARACTERISE. IN FINE GRAINED SOILS, IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT AN INTERMEDIATE LEVEL, CORRESPONDING TO THE WAY CLAY AND FINE GRAINED PARTICLES ARE ARRANGED TOGETHER, HAD TO BE CONSIDERED SO AS TO LINK MICROSCOPIC FEATURES TO MACROSCOPIC BEHAVIOUR. AN INVESTIGATION OF THE CHANGE IN MICROSTRUCTURE DURING COMPRESSION CARRIED OUT SOME TIME AGO ON A SENSITIVE CLAY FROM CANADA DEMONSTRATED THAT STUDYING THE CHANGES IN PORE SIZE DISTRIBUTION PROVIDES A SATISFACTORY DESCRIPTION OF MICROSTRUCTURE CHANGES DURING COMPRESSION. THE ANALYSIS IS APPLIED HERE TO SIX OTHER SENSITIVE CLAYS. FIRST, A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE INTACT AND REMOULDED MICROSTRUCTURE IS CONDUCTED IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND BETTER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MICROSTRUCTURE AND SENSITIVITY. SECOND, AN INTERESTING CORRELATION BETWEEN THE COMPRESSIBILITY COEFFICIENT AND THE SLOPE OF THE CUMULATIVE PORE SIZE DISTRIBUTION CURVE IS OBSERVED IN CHAMPLAIN CLAYS. THIS CONFIRMS THE ANALYSIS CONDUCTED THAT COMPRESSION IN LOOSE, LOWPLASTICITY SOILS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE PROGRESSIVE AND ORDERED COLLAPSE OF PORES, STARTING FROM THE LARGEST EXISTING ONES AND PROGRESSIVELY AFFECTING SMALLER AND SMALLER PORES. A CONCLUSION DRAWN FROM THIS WORK IS THAT A MICRO MACRO ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF CHANGES OF A RIGID FRAGILE POROUS MATRIX APPEARS TO BE MORE RELEVANT THAN A STANDARD ANALYSIS BASED ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF INDIVIDUAL GRAINS, WHERE THE GRAINS ARE TAKEN TO BE THE RELEVANT ELEMENTAL MICROSTRUCTURE UNIT (A UNIT DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY IN NATURAL CLAY SOILS). ALSO, FURTHER INSIGHT IS PROVIDED FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF MICROSTRUCTURE EFFECTS THROUGH COMPARING THE COMPRESSION CURVES OF INTACT SOIL SAMPLES TO THOSE OF REMOULDED SAMPLES.

THERE IS MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT THE DISPLACEMENT FIELD WITHIN SHEAR BANDS IN SANDS IS NON UNIFORM AND DISTINGUISHED BY DISTINCT MESOSCALE FEATURES: NAMELY, PARTICLE FORCE CHAINS. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION OF SUCH FEATURES WILL HELP ELUCIDATE THE PRECISE NATURE OF THE DEFORMATION FIELD WITHIN SHEAR BANDS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE OF THE KINEMATIC SIGNATURES OF FORCE CHAIN ACTIVITY WITHIN SHEAR BANDS IN SANDS. THE MESO SCALE KINEMATICS ARE QUANTIFIED FROM DIGITAL IMAGE CORRELATION BASED, GRAIN SCALE DISPLACEMENT ANALYSES PERFORMED ON DIGITAL IMAGES OF SPECIMENS UNDERGOING PLANE STRAIN COMPRESSION. AS IN PREVIOUS WORK, THE DATA REVEAL DISTINCT, SYSTEMATIC PATTERNS IN THE KINEMATICS ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE SHEAR BAND, WHICH SERVE AS INDIRECT EVIDENCE OF FORCE CHAIN BUILD UP AND COLLAPSE. HEREIN, LOCAL VOLUME CHANGES ARE SHOWN TO INTEGRATE INTO THIS PATTERN. TEMPORAL CHANGES IN THESE PATTERNS WITH THE PROGRESS OF DEFORMATION ARE ALSO TRACKED. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE CHANGES OBSERVED IN THE KINEMATICS FROM SOFTENING TO CRITICAL STATE PROVIDE A PHYSICAL, MESO SCALE EXPLANATION FOR THE PROGRESS OF GLOBAL STRESS STRAIN RESPONSE THROUGH THE POST PEAK REGIME.

THE KEY ELEMENT OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS COMBINING STATE OF THE ART X RAY MICRO TOMOGRAPHY IMAGING WITH THREE DIMENSIONAL VOLUMETRIC DIGITAL IMAGE CORRELATION TECHNIQUES. THIS ALLOWS NOT ONLY THE GRAIN SCALE DETAILS OF A DEFORMING SAND SPECIMEN TO BE VIEWED, BUT ALSO, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE EVOLVING THREE DIMENSIONAL DISPLACEMENT AND STRAIN FIELDS THROUGHOUT LOADING TO BE ASSESSED. X RAY IMAGING AND DIGITAL IMAGE CORRELATION HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST APPLIED INDIVIDUALLY TO STUDY SAND DEFORMATION, BUT THE COMBINATION OF THESE TWO METHODS TO STUDY THE KINEMATICS OF SHEAR BAND FORMATION AT THE GRAIN SCALE IS THE FIRST NOVEL ASPECT OF THIS WORK. MOREOVER, THE AUTHORS HAVE DEVELOPED A COMPLETELY ORIGINAL GRAIN SCALE VOLUMETRIC DIGITAL IMAGE CORRELATION METHOD THAT PERMITS THE CHARACTERISATION OF THE FULL KINEMATICS (I.E. THREE DIMENSIONAL DISPLACEMENTS AND ROTATIONS) OF ALL THE INDIVIDUAL SAND GRAINS IN A SPECIMEN. THE RESULTS OBTAINED USING THE DISCRETE VOLUMETRIC DIGITAL IMAGE CORRELATION CONFIRM THE IMPORTANCE OF GRAIN ROTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH STRAIN LOCALISATION.

IN ORDER TO EXPLORE GENERAL THREE DIMENSIONAL STRESS SPACE AN INITIALLY ISOTROPICALLY COMPRESSED SYSTEM IS SUBJECTED TO RADIAL DEVIATORIC STRAIN PATHS AND THE CORRESPONDING STRESS AND FABRIC RESPONSES ARE ILLUSTRATED. IT IS SHOWN THAT TWO PARAMETERS CAN BE IDENTIFIED THAT CHARACTERIZE THE STRESS AND FABRIC RESPECTIVELY DURING GENERAL THREEDIMENSIONAL STRAINING. EACH PARAMETER, WHEN PLOTTED AGAINST DEVIATORIC STRAIN, PROVIDES A UNIQUE EVOLUTION CURVE, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE LOADING DIRECTION. IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT, FOR GENERAL STATES OF STRESS, THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DEVIATORIC STRESS IS ENTIRELY DUE TO THE STRONG FORCE CHAINS THAT CONSTITUTE THE SUB NETWORK OF CONTACTS TRANSMITTING GREATER THAN AVERAGE CONTACT FORCES. IT IS ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LODE ANGLE FOR STRESS AND THE LODE ANGLE FOR STRAIN CAN BE CHARACTERISED BY THE CURVATURE OF A CIRCULAR ARC AND, FOR RADIAL DEVIATORIC STRAINING, THIS CONSTITUTES A FLOW RULE THAT DEFINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DIRECTIONS OF THE STRESS AND STRAIN RATE VECTORS. FURTHERMORE, BY PLOTTING THE CHARACTERISTIC STRESS PARAMETER AGAINST THE CURVATURE OF THE CIRCULAR ARC FLOW RULE, A SIMPLE SCALING LAW IS OBTAINED.

PARAMETRIC STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF SPECIMEN LENGTH AND HEIGHT SCALES (IN RELATION TO THE PARTICLE SIZE) ON THE BULK MATERIAL SHEAR STRENGTH AND SHEAR BANDING BEHAVIOUR IN THE DIRECT SHEAR TEST. A MESH FREE STRAIN CALCULATION METHOD PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED BY THE AUTHORS WAS USED TO CAPTURE AND VISUALISE THE EVOLUTION OF STRAIN LOCALISATION INSIDE THE DIRECT SHEAR BOX. SIMULATION RESULTS SHOW THAT THE MAXIMUM SHEAR STRENGTH MEASURED AT THE MODEL BOUNDARIES INCREASES WITH DECREASING SPECIMEN LENGTH SCALE AND INCREASING SPECIMEN HEIGHT SCALE. MICROMECHANICS BASED ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THE LOCAL AND GLOBAL ASPECTS OF FABRIC CHANGE AND FAILURE ARE THE MAJOR MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SPECIMEN SCALE EFFECT. GLOBAL FAILURE ALONG THE PRIMARY SHEAR BAND PREVAILS WHEN THE SPECIMEN LENGTH SCALE AND LENGTH TO HEIGHT ASPECT RATIO ARE SMALL, WHILE PROGRESSIVE FAILURE BECOMES MORE LIKELY WHEN THE SPECIMEN LENGTH SCALE AND ASPECT RATIO BECOME LARGER. FURTHER QUANTIFICATIONS OF THE SPECIMEN SCALE EFFECTS ON THE MACROSCOPIC BEHAVIOUR OF GRANULAR MATERIALS RELY ON THE FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF QUANTITATIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MATERIAL FABRIC, ANISOTROPY AND BULK STRENGTH.

S., NOTTINGHAM CENTRE FOR GEOMECHANICS, UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM, UNITED KINGDOM	THIS PAPER PRESENTS NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS WITH RESPECT TO THE RESPONSES OF TWO DIMENSIONAL GRANULAR MATERIALS UNDER PRINCIPAL STRESS ROTATIONS. THE TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT USING THE DISCRETE ELEMENT METHOD. A NUMERICAL PROCEDURE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO APPLY ARBITRARY STRESS OR STRAIN PATHS AND TO MEASURE THE INDUCED STRAIN OR STRESS CHANGES. THE PROCEDURE IS USED TO INVESTIGATE THE ELEMENTARY BEHAVIOUR OF GRANULAR MATERIALS UNDERGOING PURE STRESS ROTATION. IN THIS KIND OF TEST, THE MEAN STRESS AND THE SHEAR STRESS ARE KEPT CONSTANT WHILE THE PRINCIPAL STRESS DIRECTION CONTINUOUSLY ROTATES. TWO SERIES OF NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED, ONE WITH VARYING STRESS RATIOS AND THE OTHER WITH DIFFERENT INITIAL VOID RATIOS. MATERIAL DILATANCY AND NON COAXIALITY ARE EXPLAINED BASED ON THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE AND ITS EVOLUTION. THE MATERIAL INTERNAL STRUCTURE IS MATHEMATICALLY DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF A GEOMETRICAL SYSTEM, CALLED THE VOID CELL SYSTEM. THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE SIZE AND MATERIAL ANISOTROPY ARE CHARACTERISED BY THE STATISTICAL MEASURES OF THE VOID CELL GEOMETRIES. THE OBSERVATIONS SHOW THAT GRANULAR MATERIALS DEVELOP AN ANISOTROPIC STRUCTURE WHEN SHEARED. IN ROTATIONAL SHEAR, THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE ROTATES FOLLOWING THE ROTATION OF PRINCIPAL STRESS, ONLY LAGGING BEHIND BY A FEW DEGREES. THE ROTATION OF THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE PRODUCES STRAIN COMPONENTS NORMAL TO THE STRESS DIRECTION. ENCE, THE MATERIAL BEHAVIOUR IS NON COAXIAL. WHEN PRINCIPAL STRESS ROTATION CONTINUES, GRANULAR MATERIALS APPROACH AN ULTIMATE INTERNAL STRUCTURE, THE STRAIN TRAJECTORY IN THE DEVIATORIC PLANE APPROACHES A CIRCLE. THE MATERIAL ANISOTROPY AND THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE SIZE AT THE ULTIMATE STATE ARE DEPENDENT ON THE STRESS RATIO, BUT INDEPENDENT OF THE INITIAL VOID RATIO. THE LARGER THE STRESS RATIO IS, THE MORE ANISOTROPIC WOULD THE ULTIMATE INTERNAL STRUCTURE BECOME. THE ULTIMATE INTERNAL STRUCTURE SIZE UNDER STRESS ROTATION IS FOUND TO BE MUCH SMALLER THAN THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE SIZE ACHIEVED IN BIAXIAL SHEARING AT THE CRITICAL STATE. IN OTHER WORDS, THE VOID RATIO AT THE ULTIMATE STATE UNDERGOING ROTATIONAL SHEAR IS MUCH SMALLER THAN THAT AT THE CRITICAL STATE UNDERGOING BIAXIAL SHEARING. HENCE, THE MATERIAL BEHAVIOUR UNDER PRINCIPAL STRESS ROTATION IS MORE CONTRACTIVE.

THE SPECIMEN HAS A PRISMATIC SHAPE, AND MEASURES 57 MM WIDE X 121 MM LONG X 180 MM HIGH. IT WAS PREPARED USING A DRY NATURAL SILICA SAND KNOWN AS F 75 OTTAWA SAND AT A DENSE PACKING, AND WAS SHEARED UNTIL FAILURE. THE SPECIMEN FAILED ALONG A WELL DEFINED SINGLE SHEAR BAND. IT WAS THEN STABILISED BY SLOWLY PERCOLATING A LOW VISCOSITY EPOXY. CYLINDRICAL SUBSAMPLES 8 MM IN DIAMETER AND 50 MM HIGH WERE CORED FROM THE STABILIZED SPECIMEN AT REGIONS OF INTEREST FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. A SYNCHROTRON X RAY MICROTOMOGRAPHY TECHNIQUE WAS USED TO ACQUIRE HIGH RESOLUTION THREE DIMENSIONAL IMAGES OF THE CORES. THE SCANS HAVE A VOXEL SIZE OF 15.06 MIM, WHICH IS HIGH ENOUGH TO VISUALISE INDIVIDUAL SAND PARTICLES. POST SCANNING ANALYSES INCLUDED MAPPING THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF VOID RATIO AND PARTICLE CONTACTS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE SHEAR BAND. A GOOD CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN VOID RATIO AND PARTICLE CONTACTS. STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF PARTICLE ORIENTATION WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE SHEAR BAND WERE CALCULATED: THEY SHOW THAT MOST PARTICLES INSIDE THE SHEAR BAND ORIENT IN THE X Y PLANE TOWARDS THE Y AXIS, WHICH IS PERPENDICULAR TO THE SHEAR BAND WITH ANGLE LAMBDA IN THE RANGE 70 90. PARTICLES OUTSIDE THE SHEAR BAND HAVE NO PREFERRED ORIENTATION IN THE X Y PLANE, AND FORM CHAINS WITH PREFERRED ANGLES OF 30 60 FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE APPLIED MAJOR PRINCIPAL STRESS.

M., LABORATOIRE DE MECANIQUE DES SOLS, STRUCTURES ET MATERIAUX, ECOLE CENTRALE PARIS, FRANCE	THE AIM OF THE EXPERIMENTAL STUDY IS TO ANALYSE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE BEHAVIOUR OF A CLAYEY MATERIAL AT THE MACROSCOPIC LEVEL AND ITS LOCAL DEFORMATION PROPERTIES. THE APPROACH IS BASED ON THE STUDY OF THE ORIENTATION OF THE CLAY PARTICLES BY SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY PICTURE ANALYSIS AFTER DIFFERENT PHASES OF TRIAXIAL LOADING. THIS LEADS TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE RELATION BETWEEN THE MICROFABRIC AND THE STRAIN MECHANISMS (I.E. CONTRACTANCY AND DILATANCY) OBSERVED AT THE MACROSCOPIC LEVEL. IN THE INITIAL STATE (ONE DIMENSIONAL COMPRESSION), THE OBSERVATIONS HIGHLIGHT THE MICROSTRUCTURAL ANISOTROPY OF THE SLIGHTLY OVERCONSOLIDATED SPECIMENS WITH A PREFERENTIAL ORIENTATION OF THE PARTICLES NORMAL TO THE LOADING DIRECTION. DURING ISOTROPIC LOADING, DENSIFICATION OF THE CLAYEY MATRIX OCCURS ASSOCIATED WITH A RE ORIENTATION OF THE PARTICLES, LEADING TO AN INCREASE IN STRUCTURAL ISOTROPY, INDICATED BY THE TERM DEPOLARISATION. ON THE TRIAXIAL PATH, UP TO 5% AXIAL STRAIN, DEPOLARISATION IS REINFORCED. A ROTATION MECHANISM OF THE PARTICLES THEN SEEMS TO BECOME ACTIVATED BEYOND A CRITICAL THRESHOLD, DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE INCREASE IN THE DEVIATORIC PART OF THE STRESS TENSOR.

THE SOIL IS ASSUMED TO BE UNIFORM AND HOMOGENEOUS AND DEFORMS UNDER UNDRAINED CONDITIONS. THESE STUDIES INCLUDE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FOUNDATIONS UNDER LARGE OVERTURNING MOMENTS AND LARGE HORIZONTAL LOADS. THE CONTACT BETWEEN THE SOIL AND THE RIGID FOOTING IS UNABLE TO SUSTAIN TENSION AND THEREFORE ALLOWANCE IS MADE FOR BREAKAWAY UNDER LARGE OVERTURNING MOMENTS. THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSES ARE PRESENTED IN THE FORM OF A FAILURE LOCUS IN THE VERTICAL, HORIZONTAL AND MOMENT LOADING SPACE. A COMPARISON IS MADE BETWEEN THE RESULTS OF THE CURRENT ANALYSIS AND A SIMPLE METHOD COMMONLY USED IN CALCULATION OF THE BEARING CAPACITY OF FOUNDATIONS. IT IS SHOWN THAT, WHILE THE HYPOTHESIS OF AN EFFECTIVE FOOTING WIDTH PROVIDES A GOOD APPROXIMATION TO THE EFFECTS OF LOAD ECCENTRICITY, THE CONVENTIONAL METHOD OVERESTIMATES THE EFFECTS OF LOAD INCLINATION FOR LOAD COMBINATIONS WITH A LARGE HORIZONTAL SHEAR COMPONENT. A NEW FACTOR IS PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER THAT CAN BE USED TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECTS OF LOAD INCLINATION MORE ACCURATELY WHEN USED WITH THE SIMPLE METHOD TO CALCULATE BEARING CAPACITY.

THE DISSOLUTION LEADS TO CHANGES IN THE MICROSTRUCTURE OF THE PARTICULATE MEDIA, SUCH AS AN INCREASE IN LOCAL VOIDS OR PERMEABILITY, WHICH AFFECTS THE STRENGTH AND DEFORMATION OF SOILS. THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE SMALL STRAIN STIFFNESS CHARACTERISTICS OF SOLUBLE MIXTURES, WHICH CONSIST OF SAND AND SALT PARTICLES AT DIFFERENT VOLUME FRACTIONS. EXPERIMENTS WERE CARRIED OUT IN A CONVENTIONAL OEDOMETER CELL INTEGRATED WITH BENDER ELEMENTS FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF SHEAR WAVES. DISSOLUTIONS OF PARTICLES WERE IMPLEMENTED BY SATURATING THE MIXTURES AT VARIOUS CONFINING STRESSES. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT, AFTER DISSOLUTION, THE VERTICAL STRAIN AND THE VOID RATIO INCREASE, WHEREAS THE SHEAR WAVE VELOCITY DECREASES. THE DECREASE OF THE VELOCITY RESULTS FROM THE VOID RATIO INCREASE AND PARTICLE CONTACT DECREASE. IT IS PROVEN THAT SPECIMENS PREPARED FROM SAND AND SALT PARTICLES ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE VALUABLE INSIGHT INTO THE MACROSTRUCTURAL BEHAVIOUR OF SOLUBLE MIXTURES.

THE SELECTED SOILS ARE OF DIFFERENT GEOLOGICAL ORIGIN AND HAVE CONTRASTING INDEX PROPERTIES. RESULTS FROM TRIAXIAL TESTS SUGGEST THAT AS CLAYEY VOLCANIC SOILS WEATHER TOWARD A SILTIER TEXTURE, THEIR RESPONSE TO LOADING CHANGES ACCORDINGLY, WITH DILATION AT LARGER STRAINS LEADING TO AN INCREASE IN STRENGTH. THE FRICTIONAL STRENGTH OF TWO OF THESE SOILS, A HIGH PLASTICITY CLAY FROM MANOA VALLEY IN HONOLULU AND A YOUNG ASH SOIL FROM THE HILO AREA, DOES NOT CORRELATE WELL WITH CONVENTIONAL EMPIRICAL RELATIONS. IN TERMS OF CREEP BEHAVIOUR, THE RESPONSE UNDER CONSTANT STRESS CONDITIONS CAN BE DESCRIBED, AT LEAST TO A FIRST ORDER, WITH A SIMPLE RATE PROCESS EQUATION. A CONSTANT THAT IS A MEASURE OF STRAIN RATE ATTENUATION WITH TIME IS OBSERVED TO BE STRESS LEVEL DEPENDENT AT LOWER DEVIATORIC STRESSES, BUT RELATIVELY CONSTANT AT HIGHER STRESS LEVELS. THIS CONSTANT MAY BE RELATED TO PLASTICITY INDEX, ALTHOUGH SUCH A CORRESPONDENCE IS TENUOUS AT BEST. STRENGTH GAIN IS OBSERVED IN POST CREEP UNDRAINED TESTS, AND IS ATTRIBUTED IN PART TO PRIOR VOLUME CHANGES AND IN PART TO AGEING. IN TERMS OF CHANGES TO THE SHORT TERM FAILURE ENVELOPE, THE EFFECT OF A SUSTAINED CREEP PHASE OF 100 DAYS OR LONGER IS TO SHIFT THE FAILURE LINE UPWARD, ALBEIT AT A CONSTANT ANGLE.

BEFORE THE TEST IS CONDUCTED, THE BE TRANSDUCERS ARE PLUGGED ON BOTH ENDS OF A SOIL SAMPLE. THE INSTALLATION OF THE BES IS LIKELY TO CAUSE DISTURBANCE TO THE SOIL SAMPLE. THIS STUDY SEEKS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF BENDER ELEMENT INSTALLATION ON THE MEASUREMENT OF SHEAR WAVE VELOCITY. THE EFFECTS ARE EXAMINED BY COMPARING THE SHEAR WAVE VELOCITIES MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER THE RECEIVER BE IS PENETRATED TO DIFFERENT PENETRATION POSITIONS INTO THE SOIL. BY VARYING THE RATE OF PENETRATION OF THE BENDER, SIZE OF THE SAMPLE AND CONSOLIDATION PRESSURE DURING THE TEST, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE INSTALLATION OF THE BENDER INSIDE THE CLAY SAMPLE DID NOT CAUSE DISTURBANCE TO THE SAMPLE.

PHYSICAL MODELLING OF A PIPE ON SOFT, LIGHTLY OVERCONSOLIDATED KAOLIN CLAY WAS CONDUCTED, WITH THE EXPERIMENTAL TEST PROGRAMME SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO ESTABLISH THE MODEL PARAMETERS. THE TESTING WAS CONDUCTED WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIAS GEOTECHNICAL DRUM CENTRIFUGE USING AN ELEMENT OF PIPE 10 MM IN DIAMETER AND 50 MM LONG, AT AN ACCELERATION OF 50 TIMES THE EARTHS GRAVITY. THE MODEL PRESENTED IS EXPRESSED BY THE FORCE RESULTANTS ON THE PIPE AND THE CORRESPONDING DISPLACEMENTS AND ALLOWS PREDICTIONS OF RESPONSE TO BE MADE FOR VARIOUS VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL LOAD OR DISPLACEMENT COMBINATIONS. HOWEVER, IT IS LIMITED TO MONOTONIC LOADING AND DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE INFLUENCE OF BERMS CREATED BY REPETITIVE LARGE LATERAL DISPLACEMENTS. THE MODEL IS VERIFIED IN THIS PAPER BY RETROSPECTIVELY SIMULATING A SELECTION OF COMBINED LOADING TESTS AND COMPARING THE OUTPUT WITH THE EXPERIMENTALLY RECORDED RESULTS.

H., UNIVERSITY OF NANTES, 44603 SAINT NAZAIRE CEDEX, FRANCE; MASSIH, D.S.Y.A., CNRS AND LEBANESE UNIVERSITY, BEIRUT, LEBANON	THIS PAPER PRESENTS A PROBABILISTIC APPROACH FOR THE ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF A STRIP FOOTING SUBJECTED TO AN INCLINED LOAD. BOTH THE PUNCHING AND SLIDING MODES OF FAILURE WERE CONSIDERED. THE DETERMINISTIC MODEL OF THE SOIL PUNCHING MODE WAS BASED ON THE KINEMATIC APPROACH OF LIMIT ANALYSIS USING A NON SYMMETRICAL TRANSLATIONAL MULTIBLOCK FAILURE MECHANISM. THE VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL COMPONENTS OF THE FOOTING LOAD WERE CONSIDERED AS RANDOM VARIABLES. THE SOIL SHEAR STRENGTH PARAMETERS WERE FIRST MODELLED AS RANDOM VARIABLES AND THEN AS RANDOM FIELDS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SOIL SPATIAL VARIABILITY. SPATIAL AVERAGING WAS USED TO TRANSFORM THE RANDOM FIELD PROBLEM TO A SIMPLE PROBLEM OF CORRELATED RANDOM VARIABLES. THE RELIABILITY INDEX OF EACH FAILURE MODE AND THE SYSTEM FAILURE PROBABILITY WERE CALCULATED. WHEN THE SOIL SHEAR STRENGTH PARAMETERS WERE MODELLED AS RANDOM VARIABLES, IT WAS SHOWN THAT THE COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION OF THE ANGLE OF INTERNAL FRICTION AND THAT OF THE HORIZONTAL FOOTING LOAD HAVE A NON NEGLIGIBLE EFFECT ON THE SYSTEM FAILURE PROBABILITY. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN THE SHEAR STRENGTH PARAMETERS WERE MODELLED AS RANDOM FIELDS, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE CASE OF (A) A FINITE (I.E. NONINFINITE) AUTOCORRELATION DISTANCE AND/OR (B) AN ANISOTROPIC SOIL REGARDING THE AUTOCORRELATION DISTANCE, LEADS TO A GREATER RELIABILITY OF THE FOUNDATION WITH RESPECT TO THE REFERENCE CASE OF ISOTROPIC AND INFINITE AUTOCORRELATION DISTANCES (I.E. THE CASE OF RANDOM VARIABLES). FOR BOTH CASES OF RANDOM VARIABLES OR RANDOM FIELDS, IT WAS SHOWN THAT THE NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE SHEAR STRENGTH PARAMETERS GIVES A GREATER RELIABILITY OF THE FOUNDATION IN COMPARISON TO THE UNCORRELATED SHEAR STRENGTH PARAMETERS. FINALLY, FOR DESIGN, AN ITERATIVE PROCEDURE WAS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE BREADTH OF THE FOOTING FOR A TARGET SYSTEM FAILURE PROBABILITY.

ALTHOUGH APPROXIMATE METHODS OF ANALYSIS EXIST FOR ESTIMATING THE PENETRATION RESISTANCE, THESE DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE DISTORTION OF THE UPPER LAYER AS IT PUNCHES THROUGH INTO THE LOWER LAYER AND THERE HAS BEEN ONLY LIMITED VISUAL DEPICTION OF THE FAILURE MECHANISM THAT OCCURS FOR THE CASE OF STRONG CLAY OVERLYING WEAKER SOIL. THIS PAPER REPORTS RESULTS OF CENTRIFUGE MODEL TESTS UNDERTAKEN TO PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO SPUDCAN FOUNDATION BEHAVIOUR DURING UNDRAINED VERTICAL PENETRATION THROUGH A STRONGER CLAY LAYER INTO WEAKER MATERIAL, VARYING THE STRENGTH RATIO BETWEEN LOWER AND UPPER SOIL LAYERS, THE THICKNESS OF THE UPPER LAYER RELATIVE TO THE SPUDCAN DIAMETER AND THE STRENGTH GRADIENT OF THE LOWER LAYER. THE MODEL TESTS INCLUDED HALF SPUDCAN TESTS AGAINST A TRANSPARENT WINDOW, ALLOWING THE SOIL FLOW TO BE CAPTURED CONTINUOUSLY BY A DIGITAL CAMERA AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUANTIFIED THROUGH PARTICLE IMAGE VELOCIMETRY (PIV) ANALYSIS, AND SEPARATE FULL SPUDCAN TESTS TO MEASURE THE PENETRATION RESISTANCE. FOUR INTERESTING ASPECTS OF THE SOIL FLOW MECHANISMS WERE IDENTIFIED: (A) VERTICALLY DOWNWARDS MOTION OF THE SOIL AND CONSEQUENT DEFORMATION OF THE LAYER INTERFACE; (B) TRAPPING OF THE STRONGER MATERIAL BENEATH THE SPUDCAN, WITH THIS MATERIAL BEING CARRIED DOWN INTO THE UNDERLYING SOFT LAYER; (C) DELAYED BACK FLOW OF SOIL AROUND THE SPUDCAN INTO THE CAVITY FORMED ABOVE THE SPUDCAN; (D) EVENTUAL LOCALISED FLOW AROUND THE EMBEDDED SPUDCAN. THE EFFECT OF NORMALISED LAYER SOIL PROPERTIES AND GEOMETRY ON THE SOIL FLOW MECHANISMS AND THE FORM OF THE PENETRATION RESISTANCE PROFILE IS DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE LIKELIHOOD AND SEVERITY OF PUNCHTHROUGH FAILURE. TYPICAL CRITICAL FAILURE MODES INVOLVED PUNCHING SHEAR, WITH CLEAR SHEAR PLANES IN THE SHAPE OF A TRUNCATED CONE FORMING IN THE UPPER LAYER BELOW THE SPUDCAN. POTENTIAL PUNCH THROUGH, WITH A PEAK IN PENETRATION RESISTANCE FOLLOWED BY SOME REDUCTION, OCCURRED FOR ALMOST ALL CASES INVESTIGATED. THE REDUCTION IN RESISTANCE BECAME MORE SEVERE AS THE STRENGTH RATIO OF THE UNDERLYING LAYER TO THE UPPER LAYER REDUCED, AND ALSO AS THE UPPER LAYER THICKNESS INCREASED. THE FAILURE MODES ASSUMED BY THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE RECOMMENDED PRACTICES ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OBSERVED FROM THE STUDY, SUGGESTING A MORE RATIONAL APPROACH IS NEEDED.

IT WAS FOUND THAT ALL POINTS SHARE THE SAME PATTERN OF DISPLACEMENT, WHICH CHARACTERISES BOTH SHORT AND LONGER RECORDS. THE OVERALL BEHAVIOUR OF THE LANDSLIDE CAN BE DESCRIBED AS VISCOELASTIC AND VISCOUS OR ELASTOVISCOUS, WITH MULTI ANNUAL PERIODIC EFFECTS SUPERIMPOSED ON THE CREEP, AS THE RESULTS OF SPECTRAL ANALYSIS INDICATE. THE LANDSLIDE SEEMS INSENSITIVE TO SEASONAL VARIATIONS OF PRECIPITATION AND TO ANNUAL FLUCTUATIONS OF THE RESERVOIR LEVEL, ALTHOUGH THE FIRST FILLING OF THE RESERVOIR IS LIKELY TO HAVE HAD AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ITS MOVEMENT. THERE IS A LACK OF SUBSURFACE INFORMATION, BUT THE AVAILABLE DATA INDICATE THAT THE LANDSLIDE CORRESPONDS TO A RIGID MASS DOMINATED BY BRITTLE BEHAVIOUR AND INTERNAL SHEARING, WITH ITS KINEMATICS CONTROLLED BY THIN MYLONITIC LAYERS ALONG LOW AND HIGH ANGLE FAULTS.

THIS TECHNICAL NOTE DISCUSSES A METHOD THAT IS SIMPLE AND FAST, AND HIGHLIGHTS THE KEY PARAMETERS INFLUENCING PARTICLE RESOLUTION. HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM WITH OVERLAPPING MASS IS THAT THE DENSITY IS NON UNIFORM, WHICH LEADS TO INCORRECT MOMENTS OF INERTIA AND THEREFORE ROTATIONAL RESISTANCE. THIS TECHNICAL NOTE ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE, AND PROPOSES A SIMPLE METHOD TO REDUCE THE ERROR IN THE PRINCIPAL MOMENTS OF INERTIA. THE EFFECT ON A FALLING HEAP OF BALLAST PARTICLES IS SHOWN; THE METHOD IMPROVES NOT ONLY BEHAVIOUR, BUT ALSO COMPUTATIONAL TIME.

THE ORIGINAL DERIVATION OF THIS RELATIONSHIP WAS BASED ON INCORRECT ENERGY MINIMISATION CONSIDERATIONS, BUT THE RELATIONSHIP WAS PROVEN LATER BY DE JOSSELIN DE JONG USING FRICTION LAWS, AND HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY A LARGE BODY OF EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS. IN CONTRAST, THE VALIDITY OF ROWES STRESS DILATANCY RELATION FOR COHESIVE FRICTIONAL MATERIALS, WHICH HAS ALSO BEEN USED, ALTHOUGH NOT AS EXTENSIVELY, WAS NEVER VERIFIED. THIS PAPER SHOWS THAT ROWES STRESS DILATANCY RELATION FOR MOHR COULOMB SOILS (COHESIVE FRICTIONAL MATERIALS) IS IN FACT INCORRECT. THE PAPER ALSO PROVIDES A CORRECT STRESS DILATANCY RELATIONSHIP FOR NON ASSOCIATED MOHR COULOMB SOILS THAT HAVE BOTH COHESIVE AND FRICTIONAL STRENGTH COMPONENTS. THE DERIVATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP FOR COHESIVE FRICTIONAL SOILS PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER RELIES ON USE OF THE SAWTOOTH MODEL TOGETHER WITH THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF FRICTION.

THEY ARE ALSO DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE DRAINAGE CONDITIONS IN THE GROUND AND TO ACCELERATE THE CONSOLIDATION PROCESSES WITHIN THE CLAY. HOWEVER, SMEAR AND DISTURBING EFFECTS CAUSED DURING THE CONSTRUCTION OF STONE COLUMNS RESULT IN DEGRADATION OF CONSOLIDATION PERFORMANCE IN COMPARISON WITH THE THEORETICALLY IDEAL CONDITIONS. MODEL STONE COLUMNS ARE CONSTRUCTED IN FLIGHT UNDER 50 TIMES GRAVITY IN CENTRIFUGE TESTS AND THE SOIL MICRO STRUCTURE IN THE VICINITY OF THESE COLUMNS IS INVESTIGATED BY APPLYING DIFFERENT METHODS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AND MERCURY INTRUSION POROSIMETRY. THE RESULTS THESE TESTS CONFIRM THAT SMEAR AND DISTURBANCE OCCUR OWING TO STONE COLUMN INSTALLATION AND THE REGION INFLUENCED CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE SECTIONS: A PENETRATION ZONE (1) WHERE THE SAND PARTICLES ARE SQUEEZED THROUGH THE CLAY; A SMEAR ZONE (2) WHERE THE SOIL PARTICLES HAVE EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT REORIENTATION; AND A DENSIFICATION ZONE (3) WHERE THE STRUCTURE OF THE CLAY DOES NOT APPEAR TO CHANGE, BUT COMPACTION OF THE CLAY IS MEASURABLE. THE EXTREMES OF THE DISTURBED ZONE AROUND MODEL STONE COLUMNS ARE DETERMINED TO EXTEND TO ABOUT 2.5 TIMES THE COLUMN RADIUS.

SUCH STRENGTH PROFILES GIVE RISE TO POTENTIAL PUNCHTHROUGH FAILURE, WITH A LOCAL MAXIMUM PENETRATION RESISTANCE FOLLOWED BY SOME REDUCTION. THE PAPER IS A COMPANION PAPER TO ONE THAT PRESENTS RESULTS FROM CENTRIFUGE MODEL TESTS OF THE SAME PROBLEM, WITH THE OVERALL AIM BEING TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL FOR PUNCH THROUGH FAILURE AND ITS SEVERITY, AS A BASIS FOR IMPROVING DESIGN METHODS FOR EVALUATING SPUDCAN PENETRATION. THE LDFE ANALYSES HAVE SIMULATED CONTINUOUS PENETRATION OF SMOOTH AND ROUGH SPUDCAN FOUNDATIONS FROM THE SEA BED SURFACE. A DETAILED PARAMETRIC STUDY HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN, EXPLORING THE RELEVANT RANGE OF LAYER THICKNESS (RELATIVE TO THE SPUDCAN DIAMETER), STRENGTH RATIOS AND SPUDCAN BASE ROUGHNESS. THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN VALIDATED AGAINST PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED RESULTS AND THE CENTRIFUGE TEST DATA PRESENTED IN A COMPANION PAPER. EXCELLENT AGREEMENT WAS OBTAINED BETWEEN THE RESULTS FROM LDFE ANALYSES AND CENTRIFUGE TESTS. AS THE RATIO OF THE SHEAR STRENGTH OF THE BOTTOM LAYER TO THAT OF THE TOP LAYER DECREASED, UPWARDS SOIL FLOW AROUND THE SPUDCAN SHOULDER BECAME LESS PRONOUNCED AND THE FAILURE MECHANISM WAS DOMINATED BY A STEEP SIDED PLUG OF SOIL FROM THE TOP LAYER BEING FORCED DEEP INTO THE LOWER LAYER. THE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE PUNCH THROUGH WAS DEMONSTRATED BY A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE RESISTANCE PROFILE AS THE SPUDCAN APPROACHED THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE TWO LAYERS. A PRELIMINARY DESIGN CHART IS PROPOSED TO ESTIMATE THE CAVITY DEPTH ABOVE THE PENETRATING SPUDCAN, WHICH WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THAT FOR A SINGLE LAYER CLAY. THE PENETRATION RESPONSES HAVE BEEN PRESENTED IN TERMS OF PROFILES OF NORMALISED NET BEARING PRESSURE FOR A RANGE OF LAYER GEOMETRIES AND SOIL PROPERTIES. POTENTIAL PUNCHTHROUGH OCCURRED FOR ALL CASES WHERE THE STRENGTH RATIO WAS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 0.6, WITH THE REDUCTION IN RESISTANCE BEING GREATER THE LOWER THE STRENGTH RATIO OF THE UNDERLYING LAYER TO THE UPPER LAYER, AND THE THICKER THE UPPER LAYER, BUT REDUCING AS THE STRENGTH GRADIENT IN THE LOWER LAYER INCREASED. THE CURRENT APPROACH SUGGESTED IN OFFSHORE DESIGN GUIDELINES IS SHOWN TO UNDERESTIMATE THE PENETRATION RESISTANCE SIGNIFICANTLY, IN MOST CASES, AND GIVE POOR ESTIMATES OF THE LIKELIHOOD AND SEVERITY OF SPUDCAN PUNCH THROUGH.

THE PILES PREDOMINANTLY PROVIDE HORIZONTAL RESTRAINT TO THE POTENTIALLY UNSTABLE MASS OF THE SLOPE. THE METHOD BECOMES MORE COST EFFECTIVE AS THE PILE SPACING INCREASES, BUT THERE IS ALSO INCREASING RISK THAT THE SOIL WILL FLOW THROUGH THE GAP BETWEEN PILES, RATHER THAN ARCHING ACROSS IT. TWO AND THREE DIMENSIONAL NUMERICAL ANALYSES OF A GENERIC SLOPE WITH PILES AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS ARE UNDERTAKEN. A SIMPLE MODEL OF THE STABILISING FORCE REQUIRED FOR A GIVEN INCREASE IN FACTOR OF SAFETY OF THE SLOPE IS THEN COMBINED WITH A MODEL OF LIMITING PILE ROW INTERACTION TO ALLOW DIRECT ESTIMATION OF THE EFFECT OF PILES AT A PARTICULAR SPACING RATIO IN IMPROVING THE FACTOR OF SAFETY.

IMPULSIVE SHEAR MOTIONS WERE APPLIED, AFTER THE ATTAINMENT OF THE FULLY SOFTENED AND RESIDUAL CONDITIONS, BY MEANS OF AN APPROPRIATELY MODIFIED RING SHEAR APPARATUS. THE KINEMATICS PARAMETERS THAT CHARACTERISE SHEAR MOTIONS ARE RELATED TO CO SEISMIC DISPLACEMENTS OF RIGID LANDSLIDE BODIES, AS DEFINED BY NEWMARKS APPROACH. THE RESULTS OF THE TESTS, PERFORMED ON CLAY SAMPLES WITH DIFFERENT INDEX PROPERTIES, HIGHLIGHT THE INFLUENCE OF THE INITIAL SPATIAL DISPOSITION OF PARTICLES ON THE SHEAR MECHANISMS. IN ADDITION, IT SEEMS THAT THESE MECHANISMS CONTROL BOTH THE INVISCID AND VISCOUS COMPONENTS OF THE SHEAR STRESS. FOR HIGH SHEAR RATES, AN INCREASE OF THE VISCOUS STRENGTH IN THE RESIDUAL CONDITION DETERMINES A GREATER VISCOPLASTIC STRENGTH THAN THAT IN THE FULLY SOFTENED CONDITION. ON THIS BASIS, DIFFERENT BEHAVIOURS IN SEISMICALLY INDUCED REACTIVATION OF LANDSLIDES CAN BE EXPLAINED.

WHILE THE STATIC CAPACITY OF THE MONOPILE IS IMPORTANT, A SAFE DESIGN MUST ALSO ADDRESS ISSUES OF ACCUMULATED ROTATION AND CHANGES IN STIFFNESS AFTER LONG TERM CYCLIC LOADING. DESIGN GUIDANCE ON THIS ISSUE IS LIMITED. TO ADDRESS THIS, A SERIES OF LABORATORY TESTS WERE CONDUCTED WHERE A STIFF PILE IN DRAINED SAND WAS SUBJECTED TO BETWEEN 8000 AND 60 000 CYCLES OF COMBINED MOMENT AND HORIZONTAL LOADING. A TYPICAL DESIGN FOR AN OFFSHORE WIND TURBINE MONOPILE WAS USED AS A BASIS FOR THE STUDY, TO ENSURE THAT PILE DIMENSIONS AND LOADING RANGES WERE REALISTIC. A COMPLETE NON DIMENSIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR STIFF PILES IN SAND IS PRESENTED, AND APPLIED TO INTERPRET THE TEST RESULTS. THE ACCUMULATED ROTATION WAS FOUND TO BE DEPENDENT ON RELATIVE DENSITY, AND WAS STRONGLY AFFECTED BY THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE APPLIED CYCLIC LOAD. PARTICULAR LOADING CHARACTERISTICS WERE FOUND TO CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE ACCUMULATED ROTATION. THE PILE STIFFNESS INCREASED WITH NUMBER OF CYCLES, WHICH CONTRASTS WITH THE CURRENT METHODOLOGY WHERE STATIC LOAD DISPLACEMENT CURVES ARE DEGRADED TO ACCOUNT FOR CYCLIC LOADING. METHODS ARE PRESENTED TO PREDICT THE CHANGE IN STIFFNESS AND THE ACCUMULATED ROTATION OF A STIFF PILE DUE TO LONG TERM CYCLIC LOADING. THE USE OF THE METHODS DEVELOPED IS DEMONSTRATED FOR A TYPICAL FULLSCALE MONOPILE.

THE MODELS HAVE BEEN CALIBRATED USING DRAINED AND UNDRAINED TRIAXIAL COMPRESSION TESTS ON HOSTUN SAND. THE QUALITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL SIMULATIONS IS STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THE SHAPE CHOSEN FOR THE CRITICAL STATE LINE AT HIGH STRESSES. STRESS RESPONSE ENVELOPES HAVE BEEN PRODUCED IN ORDER TO CONTRAST THE INCREMENTAL STIFFNESSES THAT THE MODELS PREDICT FOR STRESS AND STRAIN PATHS OTHER THAN THOSE USED FOR SIMULATION. PLOTS OF SECOND ORDER WORK HAVE ALSO BEEN PRESENTED FOR EACH MODEL. NEGATIVE SECOND ORDER WORK FOR CERTAIN STRAIN PATHS INDICATES THE POTENTIAL FOR INSTABILITY AND BIFURCATION OF RESPONSE. NON ASSOCIATED FLOW IS A BASIC FEATURE OF THESE MODELS AND POTENTIALLY UNSTABLE STATES WERE FOUND TO OCCUR AT MOBILISED FRICTION ANGLES LOWER THAN THE PEAK OF THE STRESS STRAIN RESPONSE. THE HARDENING MODULI OF THE MODELS ARE SIMILAR, EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE DEVELOPED FROM DIFFERENT STARTING ASSUMPTIONS.

A SMALL SCALE PHYSICAL MODELLING METHOD WAS DEVELOPED TO STUDY THE MOVEMENT OF CLAY DURING PILE INSTALLATION. THE CLAY WAS SIMULATED USING A MIXTURE OF AMORPHOUS SILICA AND MINERAL OIL, WHICH BECOMES ALMOST TRANSPARENT WHEN THE REFRACTIVE INDICES OF THE OIL AND THE SILICA ARE WELL MATCHED. AFTER ADDING REFLECTIVE PARTICLES AND CONSOLIDATING THE MIXTURE IN A TRANSPARENT CONTAINER, CYLINDRICAL MODEL PILES WERE DRIVEN VERTICALLY AT THE CENTRE. A VERTICAL SECTION ALIGNED WITH THE PILE CENTRELINE WAS ILLUMINATED BY A LASER LIGHT SHEET, AND A SEQUENCE OF DIGITAL IMAGES WAS RECORDED. THESE WERE ANALYSED USING PARTICLE IMAGE VELOCIMETRY, AND THE COMPLETE DISPLACEMENT DISTRIBUTION DURING THE PILE INSTALLATION WAS OBTAINED. NOTWITHSTANDING SOME DISCREPANCIES AT SHALLOW DEPTHS, THE OBSERVED DISPLACEMENTS GENERALLY SHOWED FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS OF THE SHALLOW STRAIN PATH METHOD (SSPM) ONCE THE EFFECT OF SOME SOIL TRAPPED BENEATH THE FLAT PILE TIP WAS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. NORMALISATION OF THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL COMPONENTS OF MOVEMENT EMPLOYING BOTH THE PILE LENGTH AND RADIUS, BASED ON SSPM THEORY, WAS SHOWN TO BE VALID. THE NORMALISED VERTICAL DISPLACEMENT CONTOURS WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE PUBLISHED BY PREVIOUS RESEARCHERS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY COULD BE USED TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF DISTURBANCE DUE TO PILE INSTALLATION ON, FOR EXAMPLE, BURIED SERVICES OR ARCHAEOLOGY.

THESE ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT LEVELS OF STRUCTURE, WHICH STILL REQUIRE EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION. A STUDY HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT TO INVESTIGATE THE EVOLUTION OF FABRIC IN A COMPACTED NATURAL CLAY DURING WETTING AND LOADING, AND THE RESULTS ARE PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER. SAMPLES OF LONDON CLAY WERE STATICALLY COMPACTED TO THE SAE INITIAL CONDITIONS, DRY OF OPTIMUM MOISTURE CONTENT IN A PROCTOR PLOT, AND SUBSEQUENTLY TAKEN ALONG COMPLEX STRESS PATHS INVOLVING WETTING, LOADING, OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH. MERCURY INTRUSION POROSIMETRY (MIP) AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (ESEM) MICROSTRUCTURE INVESTIGATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT TO OBSERVE AND QUANTIFY THE CHANGE IN FABRIC ASSOCIATED WITH EACH PATH. THE SOIL FABRIC WAS OBSERVED TO CHANGE FROM AN AGGREGATE TO A MATRIX TYPE STRUCTURE ALONG ALL WETTING PATHS. THIS TRANSITION WAS FOUND TO TAKE PLACE ONLY WHEN THE SUCTION WAS REDUCED TO A VALUE CLOSE TO ZERO KPA. RESULTS ALSO SHOWED THAT FABRIC CHANGES DURING YIELDING WERE STRESS PATH DEPENDENT. IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO FIND A CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE VOLUME OF FREE POROSITY AND THE VOLUME OF INTRA AGGREGATE PORES, AS SUGGESTED BY SOME AUTHORS. FINALLY, THE VOLUME OF PORE WATER WAS FOUND TO AGREE CLOSELY WITH THE VOLUME OF INTRA AGGREGATE PORES, PROVIDING SUPPORT TO THE ASSUMPTION THAT IN AN UNSATURATED AGGREGATE MICROSTRUCTURE THE CLAY AGGREGATIONS ARE SATURATED.

OFTEN, COMPLEXITY ARISES FROM THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE SOIL AND THE ENVIRONMENT THE TOPIC OF THIS LECTURE. TO DEAL WITH THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM, THE CLASSICAL SOIL MECHANICS FORMULATION IS PROGRESSIVELY GENERALISED IN ORDER TO INCORPORATE THE EFFECTS OF NEW PHENOMENA AND NEW VARIABLES ON SOIL BEHAVIOUR. RECENT ADVANCES IN UNSATURATED SOIL MECHANICS ARE PRESENTED FIRST: IT IS SHOWN THAT THEY PROVIDE A CONSISTENT FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING THE ENGINEERING BEHAVIOUR OF UNSATURATED SOILS, AND THE EFFECTS OF SUCTION AND MOISTURE CHANGES. BUILDING ON THOSE DEVELOPMENTS, SOIL BEHAVIOUR IS FURTHER EXPLORED BY CONSIDERING THERMAL EFFECTS FOR TWO OPPOSITE CASES: HIGH TEMPERATURES, ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROBLEM OF STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF HIGH LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE; AND LOW TEMPERATURES IN PROBLEMS OF FREEZING GROUND. FINALLY, THE LECTURE EXAMINES SOME ISSUES RELATED TO CHEMICAL EFFECTS ON SOILS AND ROCKS, FOCUSING IN PART ON THE SUBJECT OF TUNNELLING IN SULPHATE BEARING ROCKS. IN EACH CASE NEW ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES ARE IDENTIFIED, ENHANCED THEORETICAL FORMULATIONS ARE ESTABLISHED, AND NEW OR EXTENDED CONSTITUTIVE LAWS ARE PRESENTED. PARTICULAR EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON MECHANICAL CONSTITUTIVE EQUATIONS, AS THEY ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING. THE LECTURE INCLUDES SUMMARY ACCOUNTS OF A NUMBER OF CASE HISTORIES THAT ILLUSTRATE THE RELEVANCE AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE DEVELOPMENTS DESCRIBED FOR GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING PRACTICE.

ALTHOUGH THE SIMPLE VERTICAL SLIP SOLUTION IS INTUITIVELY APPEALING, AND PROVIDES AN UPPER BOUND THAT PREVIOUS AUTHORS HAVE FOUND DIFFICULT TO IMPROVE, IT CANNOT BE EXACT, BECAUSE IT IMPLIES AN INADMISSIBLE STRESS FIELD. THIS NOTE DESCRIBES THE STRESS AND VELOCITY FIELDS OF A NEW SLIP LINE SOLUTION THAT IMPROVES THE UPPER BOUND SLIGHTLY, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, SATISFIES ALL THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS OF THE PROBLEM (AND IS THEREFORE A CANDIDATE FOR EXACTNESS). A COMPARISON WITH CLOSELY BRACKETED BOUNDS OBTAINED USING FINITE ELEMENT LIMIT ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT FOR COVER RATIOS UP TO ABOUT 1.3, THE NEW ANALYTICAL SOLUTION IS INDEED THE EXACT ONE.

A PREDICTIVE FRAMEWORK FOR LIQUEFACTION INSTABILITY	2009	GEOTECHNIQUE	59	8		673	682		11	HTTP://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URL?EID2 S2.0 77951936134&PARTNERID40&MD5229B3F30B047249F9A77749DC5AF769D	DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING, NORTH WESTERN UNIVERSITY, EVANSTON, UNITED STATES	ANDRADE, J.E., DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING, NORTH WESTERN UNIVERSITY, EVANSTON, UNITED STATES	A PREDICTIVE FRAMEWORK FOR FLOW LIQUEFACTION INSTABILITIES IN SANDS IS PRESENTED. A GENERAL CRITERION FOR LIQUEFACTION, BASED PURELY ON THE LAWS OF PHYSICS, IS PRESENTED AND ADAPTED TO THE IMPORTANT CASE OF RADIAL LOADING (E.G. TRIAXIAL, SIMPLE SHEAR) USING THE CAMBRIDGE P Q PLANE. THREE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS ARE MADE IN THE PAPER. FIRST, THE INSTABILITY CONCEPT IS UNIFIED, AND IT IS SHOWN THAT THE LIQUEFACTION CRITERION COINCIDES WITH OTHER INSTABILITY CRITERIA PROPOSED PREVIOUSLY. SECOND, THE MECHANICS TRIGGERING LIQUEFACTION INSTABILITIES ARE HIGHLIGHTED USING A SIMPLE INSTABILITY CRITERION UNDERSCORING THE ROLE OF THE MATERIAL STATE AND THE UNDERLYING CONSTITUTIVE RESPONSE. THIRD, THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK IS COMPARED WITH EXPERIMENTAL DATA FROM SAMPLES OF SAND UNDER UNDRAINED TRIAXIAL COMPRESSION, AND IT IS SHOWN THAT THE PROPOSED CRITERION CORRECTLY PREDICTS THE ONSET OF LIQUE FACTION INSTABILITY AS A FUNCTION OF THE SAND STATE. CONTRACTIVE SAMPLES ENCOUNTER THE SO CALLED LADES INSTABILITY LINE, WHEREAS DILATIVE SAMPLES DO NOT LIQUEFY, BUT RATHER UNDERGO A PHASE TRANSFORMATION. THE PREDICTIVE NATURE OF THE PROPOSED PROCEDURE MAY OPEN THE DOOR TO BETTER UNDERSTANDING, MODELLING, PREDICTION AND CAPTURE OF CATASTROPHIC INSTABILITIES IN SATURATED GRANULAR MATERIALS UNDER GENERAL LOADING CONDITIONS.

IN ADDITION, IT IS KNOWN THAT THE PERMEABILITY OF THE MATERIAL DECREASES RAPIDLY AS THE EFFECTIVE CONSOLIDATION PRESSURE IS INCREASED. A POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTION TO BOTH THE VARIABILITY AND THE RAPID DECREASE IN PERMEABILITY MIGHT BE THE VOID STRUCTURE OF THE SOIL. THE ADVENT OF MICRO CT (COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY) SCANNING EQUIPMENT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE HOW THE SHAPES AND SIZES OF THE VOIDS CHANGE WITH INCREASING CONSOLIDATION PRESSURE. THIS NOTE PRESENTS A DISCUSSION ON SOME PRELIMINARY RESULTS ON SMALL SPECIMENS OF AUCKLAND RESIDUAL CLAY. THESE INDICATE THAT AT LOW EFFECTIVE CONFINING PRESSURES THERE ARE SOME QUITE LARGE MACROVOIDS. THESE ARE FOUND TO BE GREATLY DIMINISHED IN SIZE WHEN THE EFFECTIVE CONFINING PRESSURE REACHES ABOUT 200 KPA. FROM VERY LOW EFFECTIVE CONSOLIDATION PRESSURES UP TO ABOUT 200 KPA THE PERMEABILITY DECREASES MARKEDLY.

THE GROUT MIXTURES THAT WERE TESTED CONSISTED OF WATER AND BENTONITE, TOGETHER WITH CEMENT, FLY ASH, SILICA FLOUR AND/OR RETARDER. SAMPLES WERE SUBJECTED TO A PRESSURE OF 100 400 KPA. THE PERMEABILITY OF THE GROUT CAKE FORMED DURING PRESSURE FILTRATION WAS CALCULATED FROM THE RESULTS. IT APPEARS THAT THE PERMEABILITY OF THE GROUT CAN DIFFER BY MORE THAN THREE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, DEPENDING ON THE GROUT SAMPLE TESTED. ADDING CEMENT INCREASES THE PERMEABILITY. THE GRAIN SIZE OF THE MATERIAL IN THE MIXTURE HAD MINIMAL INFLUENCE. MECHANISMS ARE DISCUSSED.

SPECIMENS WERE SUBJECTED TO DRYING AND WETTING HYDRAULIC PATHS BY REMOVING OR ADDING WATER UNDER ZERO TOTAL STRESS AND TO MECHANICAL WETTING PATHS BY COMPRESSING SPECIMENS AT CONSTANT WATER CONTENT. TO INVESTIGATE A BROAD RANGE OF VOID RATIOS, THE RECONSTITUTED SANDY CLAYEY SILT WAS INITIALLY RECONSTITUTED FROM SLURRY BY APPLYING DIFFERENT CONSOLIDATION VERTICAL STRESSES, WHEREAS THE COMPACTED SPESWHITE KAOLIN AND ADIGE RIVER EMBANKMENT WERE COMPACTED TO A BROAD RANGE OF WATER CONTENTS AND COMPACTION ENERGY. ON THE BASIS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA, A MODIFICATION TO THE VAN GENUCHTENS MODEL IS PROPOSED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EFFECT OF VOID RATIO ON MAIN DRYING AND MAIN WETTING BEHAVIOUR. THE MODEL IS BASED ON PARAMETERS HAVING CLEAR PHYSICAL MEANING AND CAN PROPERLY DESCRIBE WATER RETENTION AT MEDIUM AND LOW DEGREES OF SATURATION. IT IS FORMULATED IN SUCH A WAY THAT EFFECT OF VOID RATIO ON SCANNING BEHAVIOUR CAN POTENTIALLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR. THE MODEL APPLIES TO BOTH THE COMPACTED AND RECONSTITUTED SOILS INVESTIGATED IN THIS PROGRAMME AND DESCRIBES WATER RETENTION BEHAVIOUR REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE DEGREE OF SATURATION IS CHANGED IN A MECHANICAL OR HYDRAULIC FASHION.

USING COMPUTER GRAPHICS, THIS PROVIDES THE MODELLER WITH A SIMPLE, CLEAR, PRECISE AND FLEXIBLE METHOD WITH WHICH TO GENERATE DATA THAT CAN BE COMPARED WITH RESULTS OBTAINED ANALYTICALLY OR EXPERIMENTALLY. AS ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES, YIELD SURFACES ARE CONSTRUCTED IN THE CONSTANT PRESSURE PLANE IN PRINCIPAL STRESS SPACE USING THE DRUCKER PRAGER AND FROSSARDS DISSIPATION FUNCTIONS, AND TWO MODIFIED FORMS OF HOULSBYS DISSIPATION FUNCTION. FOR CONSTANT VOLUME FLOW THESE PRODUCE THE DRUCKER PRAGER, MOHR COULOMB AND MATSUOKA NAKAI YIELD SURFACES. EACH IS PAIRED WITH BOTH AN ISOTROPIC AND AN ANISOTROPIC DILATANCY RULE. THE DIRECTION OF PLASTIC FLOW AT YIELD, CONSISTENT WITH THE CHOICE OF DISSIPATION FUNCTION AND DILATANCY RULE, CAN BE DETERMINED FROM THESE CONSTRUCTIONS. ONE OF THE YIELD SURFACES PRODUCED IS COMPARED WITH THE RESULTS FROM TRUE TRIAXIAL TESTS WHERE THE RATE OF DILATANCY HAS BEEN DETERMINED. AN EXAMPLE OF ROWES STRESS DILATANCY PLOTS IS ALSO PRODUCED.

IN THIS RESEARCH, THE DYNAMIC BEHAVIOUR OF A ROCKFILL DAM WITH AN ASPHALT CONCRETE CORE HAS BEEN STUDIED UTILISING CENTRIFUGE MODELLING. INSTRUMENTS INCLUDING ACCELEROMETERS AND LVDTS WERE INSTALLED WITHIN AND ON THE MODELS AND RESPONSE ACCELERATIONS AND INDUCED DEFORMATIONS WERE RECORDED. THE RECORDED DATA AND OBSERVATIONS OF THE CENTRIFUGE MODELS SHOWED THAT THE INDUCED DEFORMATIONS IN THE ASPHALT CORE UNDER AN IMPACT LOAD WITH A LARGE ACCELERATION OF 0 7G WERE VERY SMALL. ON THE OTHER HAND, COMPARING THE RESULTS OF CENTRIFUGE TESTS WITH THE RESULTS OF THREE DIMENSIONAL NUMERICAL DYNAMIC ANALYSES OF A PROTOTYPE DAM INDICATED THAT THE NUMERICAL RESULTS CORRESPONDED WELL WITH THE DATA RECORDED DURING CENTRIFUGE TESTS AND THE ASPHALT CORE SHOWED SIMILAR BEHAVIOUR IN BOTH NUMERICAL AND CENTRIFUGE MODELS. THE RESULTS OF NON LINEAR THREE DIMENSIONAL DYNAMIC RESPONSE ANALYSES OF THE CASE STUDY SELECTED FOR THIS RESEARCH SHOWED THAT UNDER A SEVERE EARTHQUAKE, THE INDUCED SHEAR STRAINS IN MOST PARTS OF THE ASPHALT CORE ZONE WERE STILL SMALL AND THE DAM BEHAVED IN A SAFE MANNER.

MOREOVER, REGARDING RESIDUAL STRENGTH, AN EFFICIENT METHOD TO COMPLETE THE RESIDUAL STATE HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED, ALTHOUGH IT IS KNOWN THAT MUCH DEFORMATION IS NECESSARY. THEREFORE THIS STUDY FIRST DEMONSTRATES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE NEWLY DEVELOPED RING SHEAR APPARATUS THROUGH COMPARISON WITH THE RESULTS OF TRIAXIAL COMPRESSION TESTS. SHEAR RATE EFFECTS ARE THEN EXAMINED IN RING SHEAR TESTS USING SAMPLES CONTAINING VARIOUS PROPORTIONS OF BENTONITE. FINALLY, USING RESULTS OBTAINED USING VARIOUS REMOULDED SOILS, THE EFFECTS OF PLASTICITY INDEX IN SATURATED SOILS ON MAXIMUM AND RESIDUAL STRENGTH ARE DEMONSTRATED.

INITIALLY, THIS WAS DONE BY ASSUMING NO SLIPPAGE ALONG THE BOUNDARY, THUS FOR A PERFECTLY ROUGH OEDOMETRIC RING WITH UNIFORM ANISOTROPIC STRESS STATE AND ZERO IN PLANE DEFORMATION. HERE THE OTHER EXTREME CASE, THE PERFECTLY SMOOTH OEDOMETRIC RING, IS EXAMINED BY ACCOUNTING FOR THE ANALYTICAL SOLUTION OF A CIRCULAR CYLINDRICAL CONTINUUM FOR ISOTROPIC LINEAR ELASTICITY, USING APPROPRIATE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS. AFTER DETERMINING EXPERIMENTALLY THE FRICTIONAL COEFFICIENT, THIS SOLUTION IS USED IN A SEMI EMPIRICAL INTERPOLATION METHOD FOR ESTIMATING THE INFLUENCE OF THE ROUGHNESS OF THE OEDOMETRIC RING. FOR THE ASSUMPTION OF A ROUGH OEDOMETRIC RING FOR THE INVESTIGATED POTCLAY THE ANISOTROPY RATIO DECREASES IN THE RANGE 0 58 TO 0 30 WITH INCREASING AXIAL EFFECTIVE STRESS IN THE RANGE 355  SIGMA AX  1860 KPA. FOR THE OBSERVED REDUCED WALL ROUGHNESS THE ANISOTROPY RATIO IS SHOWN TO INCREASE TO THE RANGE 0 70 TO 0 40, WHICH IS A RELATIVE INCREASE OF 21% TO 34%. THE RELATIVE ERROR IN THIS ESTIMATED ANISOTROPY RATIO IS ESTIMATED IN THE RANGE 9% TO 13%, INCREASING WITH INCREASING AXIAL EFFECTIVE STRESS. THE ORIENTATION OF THE IN PLANE ANISOTROPY IS SHOWN TO BE INDEPENDENT OF WALL ROUGHNESS.

IN A FIRST TEST SERIES, UNDRAINED MONOTONIE TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT AFTER DISSIPATING THE EXCESS PORE WATER PRESSURE DEVELOPED DURING LIQUEFACTION. THE INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT PARAMETERS SUCH AS AMPLITUDE OF AXIAL STRAIN, RELATIVE DENSITY AND CONFINING PRESSURE PRIOR TO LIQUEFACTION ON THE POST LIQUEFACTION UNDRAINED RESPONSE HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED. THE RESULTS OBTAINED HIGHLIGHT AN INSIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OF AMPLITUDE OF AXIAL STRAIN, CONFINING PRESSURE AND A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OF RELATIVE DENSITY ON THE POST LIQUEFACTION UNDRAINED MONOTONIE STRESS STRAIN RESPONSE. IN THE SECOND SERIES, UNDRAINED MONOTONIE TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT ON SIMILAR TRIAXIAL SAMPLES WITHOUT DISSIPATING THE EXCESS PORE WATER PRESSURE DEVELOPED DURING LIQUEFACTION. THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THAT THE AMPLITUDE OF AXIAL STRAIN PRIOR TO LIQUEFACTION HAS A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE POSTLIQUEFACTION UNDRAINED MONOTONIE RESPONSE. IN ADDITION, DEM SIMULATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT ON AN ASSEMBLY OF SPHERES TO SIMULATE POST LIQUEFACTION BEHAVIOUR. THE SIMULATIONS WERE VERY SIMILAR TO THE EXPERIMENTS WITH AN OBJECTIVE TO UNDERSTAND THE BEHAVIOUR OF MONOTONIE STRENGTH OF LIQUEFIED SAMPLES FROM THE GRAIN SCALE. THE NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS USING DEM HAVE CAPTURED QUALITATIVELY ALL THE FEATURES OF THE POST LIQUEFACTION UNDRAINED MONOTONIE RESPONSE IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE EXPERIMENTS. IN ADDITION, A DETAILED STUDY ON THE EVOLUTION OF MICROMECHANICAL PARAMETERS SUCH AS THE AVERAGE COORDINATION NUMBER AND INDUCED ANISOTROPIC COEFFICIENTS HAS BEEN REPORTED DURING THE POST LIQUEFACTION UNDRAINED MONOTONIE LOADING.

EXPERIMENTS IN THE LABORATORY, WHERE SILTY SAND WAS USED TO MAKE A MODEL OF AN EMBANKMENT, WERE CARRIED OUT TO OBSERVE AND CONFIRM THE FAILURE PROCESS OF AN EMBANKMENT RESULTING FROM OVERFLOW. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS WERE QUITE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN PREVIOUS STUDIES BY OTHER RESEARCHERS. UNDERSTANDING THE WAY IN WHICH A FROUDE CRITICAL POINT MIGRATES DURING OVERTOPPING FAILURE, AND THEN STOPS, IS ESSENTIAL TO MODELLING THE FAILURE MECHANISM. THE MIGRATION OF THE FROUDE CRITICAL POINT INVOLVES THE DEVELOPMENT OF EROSION AND THE VERTICAL DROP, OR HEADCUT, THAT IS CAUSED WHEN IT STOPS. SHALLOW WATER EQUATIONS AND AN EQUATION GOVERNING THE CHANGE IN ELEVATION OF THE EROSIONAL SURFACE ARE USED TO DESCRIBE THE EROSION OF THE EMBANKMENT. THE THEORY ALLOWS THE PROFILES OF AN EMBANKMENT DURING OVERTOPPING FAILURE TO BE PARTIALLY DETERMINED UNDER THE CONDITION OF IMPOSED PARAMETERS. IN ADDITION, CONSIDERING THE FROUDE CRITICAL POINTS MIGRATION AND SUSPENSION, THE TIME REQUIRED FOR THE COMPLETE FAILURE OF AN EMBANKMENT, THAT IS THE EMBANKMENT BREAK, CAN BE ESTIMATED.

CLOSED FORM SOLUTION FOR PLASTIC ZONE FORMATION AROUND A CIRCULAR TUNNEL IN HALF SPACE OBEYING MOHR COULOMB CRITERION	2009	GEOTECHNIQUE	59	8		691	701		3	HTTP://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URL?EID2 S2.0 77951886767&PARTNERID40&MD57089B02D79DD6DBA55CD5D336FD29558	DEPARTMENT OF RURAL AND SURVEYING ENGINEERING, NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY, ATHENS, GREECE	MASSINAS, S.A., DEPARTMENT OF RURAL AND SURVEYING ENGINEERING, NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY, ATHENS, GREECE; SAKELLARIOU, M.G., DEPARTMENT OF RURAL AND SURVEYING ENGINEERING, NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY, ATHENS, GREECE	A CLOSED FORM SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM OF THE PLASTIC ZONE AND STRESS DISTRIBUTION AROUND A CIRCULAR TUNNEL IN AN ELASTIC PLASTIC HALF SPACE, DERIVED USING BIPOLAR COORDINATES, IS THE MAIN SCOPE OF THIS PAPER. BY ASSUMING A UNIFORMLY APPLIED SURFACE LOADING, THE WHOLE SEMI INFINITE SPACE IS UNDER UNIFORM PRESSURE: THUS THE GRAVITATIONAL EFFECT IS NEGLECTED, WHILE THE PLASTIC ZONE FORMATION AROUND THE CIRCULAR TUNNEL IS CONTROLLED BY THE APPLIED INTERNAL SUPPORT PRESSURE. THE PLASTIC BEHAVIOUR OF THE HALF SPACE IS DESCRIBED BY THE MOHR COULOMB YIELD CRITERION, AND THE SOIL IS ASSUMED TO BE HOMOGENEOUS AND ISOTROPIC WITH EARTH PRESSURE COEFFICIENT K 0 EQUAL TO UNITY. THE CRITICAL INTERNAL PRESSURE, WHERE THE INITIAL YIELDING OCCURS AT THE TUNNEL WALL, IS DERIVED, ALONG WITH EQUATIONS DESCRIBING THE PLASTIC ZONE AND PLASTIC STRESSES. THESE EQUATIONS ARE FUNCTIONS OF THE SOIL PROPERTIES, WHICH ARE COHESION AND FRICTION ANGLE. THIS DERIVED CLOSED FORM SOLUTION IS VALIDATED THROUGH MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS, AND IS ALSO COMPARED WITH NUMERICAL MODELS UNDER GRAVITATIONAL LOAD, SOLVED USING THE FINITE DIFFERENCE METHOD. THIS INNOVATIVE CLOSED FORM SOLUTION HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN PRACTICAL PROBLEMS BY INTRODUCING A SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE METHOD THAT ALLOWS THE QUICK ESTIMATION OF A SHALLOW TUNNELS BEHAVIOUR, SINCE IT GIVES, IN PRINCIPLE, THE OPPORTUNITY FOR QUICK AND ACCURATE CALCULATION OF THE PLASTIC ZONE AND STRESS DISTRIBUTION AROUND THE CIRCULAR TUNNEL. BY APPLYING DIFFERENT VALUES OF SUPPORT PRESSURE, THE TUNNEL DESIGNER CAN EASILY EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF DIFFERENT DESIGN ALTERNATIVES, SUCH AS SHOTCRETE SHELL AND TUNNEL BORING MACHINE SUPPORT PRESSURE. AS A RESULT, AN EFFICIENT AND INNOVATIVE METHOD OF SOLVING SHALLOW TUNNELLING PROBLEMS IN COHESIVE FRICTIONAL SOIL IS INTRODUCED.

COMPARISONS BETWEEN TESTS ON INTACT AND RECONSTITUTED SAMPLES AND BETWEEN VERTICALLY AND HORIZONTALLY TRIMMED INTACT SAMPLES HIGHLIGHTED THE EFFECTS OF STRUCTURE ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF THIS UNCEMENTED SAND, IN PARTICULAR A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF ANISOTROPY. TWO DISTINCT SUBSTRATA HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH DIFFERENT FINES CONTENTS, AND THE KEY DIFFERENCE IN THEIR BEHAVIOUR HAS BEEN FOUND HERE TO BE THE LOCATION OF THEIR CRITICAL STATE LINE IN THE V.LNP PLANE, WHICH HAS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE ENGINEERING BEHAVIOUR OF THE TWO SUBSTRATA AND CAN EXPLAIN RECENT UNUSUAL OBSERVATIONS OF DECREASING PILE CAPACITY WITH DEPTH.

MEASUREMENT OF THE LIQUID LIMIT IS A MECHANICAL PROCESS, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF ERRORS OCCURRING DURING MEASUREMENT IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT THE CASE FOR PLASTIC LIMIT TESTING, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE CURRENT METHOD OF MEASUREMENT IS EMBRACED BY MANY STANDARDS AROUND THE WORLD. THE METHOD IN QUESTION RELIES ON A FAIRLY CRUDE PROCEDURE KNOWN WIDELY AS THE THREAD ROLLING TEST, THOUGH IT HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MUCH CRITICISM IN RECENT YEARS. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT A NEW, MORE RELIABLE METHOD OF MEASURING THE PLASTIC LIMIT IS DEVELOPED USING A MECHANICAL PROCESS THAT IS BOTH CONSISTENT AND EASILY REPRODUCIBLE. THE WORK REPORTED IN THIS PAPER CONCERNS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW DEVICE TO MEASURE THE PLASTIC LIMIT, BASED ON THE EXISTING FALLING CONE APPARATUS. THE FORCE REQUIRED FOR THE TEST IS EQUIVALENT TO THE APPLICATION OF A 54 N FAST STATIC LOAD ACTING ON THE EXISTING CONE USED IN LIQUID LIMIT MEASUREMENTS. THE TEST IS COMPLETE WHEN THE RELEVANT WATER CONTENT OF THE SOIL SPECIMEN ALLOWS THE CONE TO ACHIEVE A PENETRATION OF 20 MM. THE NEW TECHNIQUE WAS USED TO MEASURE THE PLASTIC LIMIT OF 16 DIFFERENT CLAYS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. THE PLASTIC LIMIT MEASURED USING THE NEW METHOD IDENTIFIED REASONABLY WELL THE WATER CONTENT AT WHICH THE SOIL PHASE CHANGES FROM THE PLASTIC TO THE SEMI SOLID STATE. FURTHER EVALUATION WAS UNDERTAKEN BY CONDUCTING PLASTIC LIMIT TESTS USING THE NEW METHOD ON SELECTED SAMPLES AND COMPARING THE RESULTS WITH VALUES REPORTED BY LOCAL SITE INVESTIGATION LABORATORIES. AGAIN, REASONABLE AGREEMENT WAS FOUND.

WHILE THE METHODS FOR EVALUATION OF A0 ARE RELIABLE FOR NORMALLY CONSOLIDATED SOILS, SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTIES STILL EXIST IN EVALUATING K0 IN OVERCONSOLIDATED CLAYS, GIVEN THAT IT IS INFLUENCED BY THE STRESS HISTORY OF THE MATERIAL, TOGETHER WITH THE AGE, STRUCTURE, MINERALOGICAL COMPOSITION AND DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT. INDEED, SOME OF THESE FACTORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SOIL BECOMING ANISOTROPIC. THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK FOR PREDICTION OF K0 IN OVERCONSOLIDATED SOILS DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR ANY INFLUENCES CAUSED BY ANISOTROPY. THE WORK REPORTED IN THIS PAPER EVALUATES THE VALIDITY OF A REVISED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN K0OC AND OCR (OVERCONSOLIDATION RATIO) USING DATA OBTAINED FROM LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS. THE TESTS WERE PERFORMED ON RECONSTITUTED AND UNDISTURBED SAMPLES OF BELFAST UPPER BOULDER CLAY, LONDON CLAY AND GAULT CLAY. TESTS WERE ALSO PERFORMED ON RECONSTITUTED SAMPLES OF KAOLIN. THE VALUES OF K0OC WERE DETERMINED USING VARIOUS APPROACHES, INCLUDING ON SAMPLE MEASUREMENTS. THE RESULTS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT RELIABLE PREDICTIONS OF K0OC CAN BE MADE USING THE PROPOSED RELATIONSHIP.

SUCH ANALYSES ARE NOT COMMON, BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN CONSTRUCTING THREE DIMENSIONAL MECHANISMS OF FAILURE IN FRICTIONAL SOILS. A CLASS OF ADMISSIBLE ROTATIONAL MECHANISMS IS CONSIDERED IN THIS PAPER. THE FAILURE SURFACE HAS THE SHAPE OF A CURVILINEAR CONE (HORN), WITH UPPER AND LOWER CONTOURS DEFINED BY LOG SPIRALS; ALL RADIAL CROSS SECTIONS OF THE SURFACE ARE CIRCULAR. IN THE SPECIAL CASE OF COHESIVE SOILS (UNDRAINED BEHAVIOUR), THE SHAPE OF THE FAILURE SURFACE REDUCES TO A TORUS. AN ALTERNATIVE FAILURE SURFACE IS GENERATED WHEN THE AXIS OF ROTATION INTERSECTS THE CIRCLE THAT GENERATES THE SURFACE. THE 3D MECHANISM IS FURTHER MODIFIED WITH A PLANE STRAIN CENTRAL INSERT TO ENSURE THE TRANSITION TO A PLANE STRAIN MECHANISM IF NO RESTRAINT IS PLACED ON THE SLOPE WIDTH. ALSO, THE SPHERICAL FAILURE SURFACE CONSIDERED IN THE LITERATURE IS RE EXAMINED. THE CRITICAL HEIGHT OF SLOPES WITH FINITE WIDTH IS DETERMINED, AND THE RESULTS ARE PRESENTED IN THE FORM OF GRAPHS AND TABLES FOR A PRACTICAL RANGE OF PARAMETERS. A SEPARATE SET OF RESULTS IS GIVEN FOR THE CRITICAL DEPTH OF EXCAVATIONS, WHERE THE EXTENT OF THE FAILURE MECHANISM IS DEFINED BY THE GEOMETRY OF THE EARTHWORKS. AN EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATES THE PRACTICAL USE OF THE RESULTS.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS NUMERICAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO REPEATED PENETRATION AND EXTRACTION OF THE PENETROMETERS IN SOFT CLAY, USING A LARGE DEFORMATION FINITE ELEMENT METHOD. THIS APPROACH WAS ABLE TO UNCOVER REMOULDING MECHANISMS AND RESULTING GRADUAL STRENGTH DEGRADATION OF SOIL FROM INTACT TO FULLY REMOULDED STATES BY MODELLING THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF CYCLIC PENETRATION AND EXTRACTION. ANALYSES SHOWED THAT A CYCLIC RANGE OF THREE DIAMETERS OF THE PENETROMETERS WAS SUFFICIENT TO AVOID OVERLAP OF THE FAILURE MECHANISM AT THE EXTREMES AND MID POINT OF THE CYCLIC RANGE. THE RESISTANCE DEGRADATION CURVES COULD BE FITTED ACCURATELY BY SIMPLE EXPRESSIONS CONSISTENT WITH THE STRAIN SOFTENING SOIL MODEL ADOPTED. THE STRAIN RATE DEPENDENCE WAS SIMILAR IN NON SOFTENING OR POST CYCLIC SOIL FOR A GIVEN RATE PARAMETER. THE RESISTANCE FACTOR FOR THE POST CYCLIC CONDITION IS HIGHER THAN THAT FOR THE INITIAL CONDITIONS, DEPENDING TO SOME DEGREE UPON SOIL SENSITIVITY AND BRITTLENESS PARAMETER.

IT HAS RECENTLY BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN THE LITERATURE, HOWEVER, THAT AN ALTERNATIVE MECHANISM EXISTS, WHEREBY PILES CARRYING SIGNIFICANT AXIAL LOADS MAY BECOME UNSTABLE AS LATERAL SOIL RESTRAINT IS LOST OWING TO EARTHQUAKE INDUCED SOIL LIQUEFACTION. IN THE WORK PRESENTED HERE AND IN A COMPANION PAPER, THIS EFFECT IS EXAMINED IN GREATER DEPTH, PARTICULARLY REGARDING THE INTEGRATION WITH AND EFFECTS ON THE LATERAL RESPONSE OF PILES SUCH THAT THE TWO EFFECTS CAN BE TREATED UNDER A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK. DYNAMIC CENTRIFUGE TESTING WAS USED TO INVESTIGATE PILE INSTABILITY BY EXAMINING THE BEHAVIOUR OF PILE GROUPS WITH LATERAL DEFLECTIONS. AMPLIFICATION OF THESE DEFLECTIONS WAS OBSERVED TO OCCUR DURING LIQUEFACTION, ALTHOUGH CURRENTLY AVAILABLE SIMPLE IDEALISATIONS OF SOIL BEHAVIOUR WERE FOUND GREATLY TO OVER PREDICT THESE AMPLIFICATIONS WHEN COMPARED WITH THE EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS. THE RESPONSE OF THE SOIL TO SUCH LARGE DEFORMATION EVENTS WAS DETERMINED FOR USE IN MORE SOPHISTICATED NUMERICAL MODELING PRESENTED IN THE COMPANION PAPER. RELATIVE PILE SOIL FLEXIBILITY WAS FOUND TO HAVE A STRONG INFLUENCE ON AMPLIFICATIONS OCCURRING IN THE TESTS. ULTIMATELY, AT HIGH AXIAL LOAD OR AMPLIFICATION, UNSTABLE COLLAPSE (BIFURCATION) WAS FOUND TO OCCUR BOTH DURING EARTHQUAKE SHAKING, AND AFTERWARDS OWING TO EXCESS PORE PRESSURE MIGRATION ALTERING THE STRENGTH OF THE SUPPORTING SOIL SURROUNDING THE PILES.

TEST BEDS WERE CONSTRUCTED IN LIFTS WITH CONTROLLED THICKNESS AND INSTRUMENTED WITH STRESS AND STRAIN SENSORS. A COMPOSITE ASSESSMENT OF ROLLER MEASURED STIFFNESS ON INDIVIDUAL LIFTS THROUGHOUT CONSTRUCTION REVEALED THAT MEASUREMENT DEPTHS RANGED FROM 0.9 TO 1.2 M USING TWO COMMON SIZED VIBRATORY ROLLERS. FOR OVERLYING MATERIAL LAYER THICKNESS GREATER THAN THE MEASUREMENT DEPTH, ROLLER MEASURED STIFFNESS WAS FOUND TO BE A FUNCTION OF THE OVERLYING MATERIAL ONLY. OTHERWISE, ROLLER STIFFNESS WAS A FUNCTION OF THE TWO MATERIALS. MEASUREMENT DEPTH WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY THE LAYER MATERIAL STIFFNESS RATIO. THE SENSITIVITY OF ROLLER MEASURED STIFFNESS TO THIN LIFTS OF MATERIAL (E.G. 0.2 M) WAS FOUND TO DEPEND ON THE STIFFNESS RATIO OF THE TWO MATERIALS. DATA FROM IN GROUND INSTRUMENTATION SUPPORTED BY ELASTIC THEORY REVEALED THAT, AT THE EXPERIMENTALLY OBSERVED MEASUREMENT DEPTHS, BOTH THE TOTAL AND CYCLIC STRESS AND STRAIN WERE APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THEIR MAXIMUM VALUES. AN ANALYSIS OF CYCLIC STRAIN PROFILES FROM THREE DIFFERENT SOILS REVEALED THAT THE MEASUREMENT DEPTH IS WEAKLY DEPENDENT ON EXCITATION FORCE AMPLITUDE. FOR THE TWO ROLLERS USED, MEASUREMENT DEPTH RANGED FROM 0.8 M UNDER LOW EXCITATION FORCE TO 1.2 M UNDER HIGH EXCITATION FORCE.

HENCE PROBABILISTIC MODELS FOR ASSESSMENT OF ALLOWABLE LATERAL LOAD ARE NECESSARY. CONE PENETRATION TEST (CPT) DATA ARE OFTEN USED TO DETERMINE SOIL STRENGTH PARAMETERS, WHEREBY THE ALLOWABLE LATERAL LOAD OF THE PILE IS COMPUTED. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, THE MAXIMUM LATERAL DISPLACEMENT AND MOMENT OF THE PILE ARE OBTAINED BASED ON THE COEFFICIENT OF SUBGRADE REACTION APPROACH, CONSIDERING THE NONLINEAR SOIL BEHAVIOUR IN UNDRAINED CLAY. THE COEFFICIENT OF SUBGRADE REACTION IS RELATED TO THE UNDRAINED SHEAR STRENGTH OF SOIL, WHICH CAN BE OBTAINED FROM CPT DATA. THE SOIL MEDIUM IS MODELLED AS A ONE DIMENSIONAL RANDOM FIELD ALONG THE DEPTH, AND IT IS DESCRIBED BY THE STANDARD DEVIATION AND SCALE OF FLUCTUATION OF THE UNDRAINED SHEAR STRENGTH OF SOIL. INHERENT SOIL VARIABILITY, MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTY AND TRANSFORMATION UNCERTAINTY ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. THE STATISTICS OF MAXIMUM LATERAL DEFLECTION AND MOMENT ARE OBTAINED USING THE FIRST ORDER, SECOND MOMENT TECHNIQUE. HASOFER LIND RELIABILITY INDICES FOR COMPONENT AND SYSTEM FAILURE CRITERIA, BASED ON THE ALLOWABLE LATERAL DISPLACEMENT AND MOMENT CAPACITY OF THE PILE SECTION, ARE EVALUATED. THE GEOTECHNICAL DATABASE FROM THE KONASEEMA SITE IN INDIA IS USED AS A CASE EXAMPLE. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE RELIABILITYBASED DESIGN APPROACH FOR PILE FOUNDATIONS, CONSIDERING THE SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF SOIL, PERMITS A RATIONAL CHOICE OF ALLOWABLE LATERAL LOADS.

THE POPULAR PSEUDOSTATIC NON LINEAR P Y ANALYSIS METHOD HAS HERE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ACCOUNT FOR SUCH INSTABILITY EFFECTS USING THE RIKS POST BUCKLING ANALYSIS METHOD, HERE IMPLEMENTED IN ABAQUS. THE NUMERICAL METHOD WAS VALIDATED AGAINST CENTRIFUGE MODEL TESTS PRESENTED IN THE COMPANION PAPER AND PRE COLLAPSE AMPLIFICATION EFFECTS AND COLLAPSE LOADS WERE FOUND TO BE WELL PREDICTED. THE MODEL WAS EXTENDED TO EXAMINE THE RESPONSE OF 2 X 2 PILE GROUPS FORMED FROM 0.5 M DIAMETER PILES WITH BENDING PROPERTIES TYPICAL OF STEEL AND REINFORCED CONCRETE AND WITH INITIAL DEFLECTIONS INDICATIVE OF THOSE THAT MAY OCCUR DURING LATERAL SPREADING AS A RESULT OF STRONG SHAKING. THESE ANALYSES DEMONSTRATED THE VULNERABILITY OF THE FLEXIBLE CONCRETE PILES TO SIGNIFICANT AMPLIFICATION AND UNSTABLE COLLAPSE EVEN AT MODERATE LOADS, WHILE FOR THE STIFFER AND STRONGER STEEL PILES, AMPLIFICATIONS ARE ONLY 10 20% EVEN AT MAXIMUM TYPICAL WORKING LOADS, AND THEREFORE PRACTICALLY NEGLIGIBLE IN THE DESIGN OF PILES IN LIQUEFIABLE SOILS.

THE EFFECTS OF THE ORDER OF SOIL LAYERS ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF VACUUM CONSOLIDATION OF THE TWO LAYER SOIL SYSTEM HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED BY COMPARING VACUUM PRESSURE AND SURCHARGE LOAD INDUCED CONSOLIDATIONS. UNDER ONE WAY DRAINAGE CONDITIONS, FOR BOTH A SURCHARGE LOAD AND A VACUUM PRESSURE, THE ORDER OF SOIL LAYERS ONLY INFLUENCES THE RATE OF CONSOLIDATION BUT NOT THE FINAL SETTLEMENT. WHEN A LAYER WITH A RELATIVE LOWER VALUE OF HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY (K) IS LOCATED IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE DRAINAGE BOUNDARY, THE CONSOLIDATION RATE IS SLOWER. HOWEVER, FOR VACUUM PRESSURE APPLIED UNDER TWO WAY DRAINAGE CONDITIONS, THE ORDER OF THE SOIL LAYERS NOT ONLY INFLUENCES THE RATE OF CONSOLIDATION BUT ALSO THE MAGNITUDE OF SETTLEMENT.

HOWEVER, THE INFLUENCE OF PARTICLE BREAKAGE ON THE RESILIENT MODULUS HAS NOT BEEN DESCRIBED IN DEPTH. THE CURRENT STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE INFLUENCE OF PARTICLE BREAKAGE ON THE RESILIENT MODULUS OF LATITE BALLAST (COMMONLY USED IN RAILWAY TRACK IN NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA). AGGREGATE DEGRADATION IS REPRESENTED BY THE BALLAST BREAKAGE INDEX (BBI). LABORATORY TEST RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE BBI HAS A PROFOUND INFLUENCE ON THE RESILIENT MODULUS OF BALLAST. THE RESILIENT MODULUS INCREASES WITH BBI, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE EFFECTIVE CONFINING PRESSURE. IN ADDITION, A SIMPLE HYPERBOLIC RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN PROPOSED BETWEEN THE RESILIENT MODULUS MR AND THE BULK STRESS PHI FOR LATITE BALLAST.

THE EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS CONSIST IN SUCCESSIVELY APPLYING VERY SMALL AXIAL CYCLIC STATIC LOADINGS (STRAIN SINGLEAMPLITUDE CYCLE, SIGMASA  10 5 M/M) AND FOUR TYPES OF WAVE, GENERATED BY PIEZOELECTRIC SENSORS (COMPRESSIVE AND SHEAR WAVES IN THE AXIAL AND RADIAL DIRECTIONS), AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THE STRESS STRAIN CURVE. THE USE OF BOTH STATIC AND DYNAMIC RESULTS ALLOWS FOR AN ENTIRE DESCRIPTION OF THE ANISOTROPIC ELASTIC COMPLIANCE TENSOR AT A GIVEN STRESS STRAIN STATE TO BE MADE. THE EVOLUTIONS OF THIS TENSOR DURING TRIAXIAL LOADING AND UNLOADING ARE PRESENTED. THE ISOTROPIC AND DEVIATORIC TRIAXIAL STRESS PATHS CONSIDERED UNDERLINE THE EFFECTS OF INHERENT AND INDUCED ANISOTROPY RESPECTIVELY. THE DIFFERENT METHODS USED TO SET THE SAMPLE INVOLVE CLEARLY DIFFERENT KINDS OF ANISOTROPIC ELASTIC BEHAVIOUR, WHICH ARE PROBABLY INDICATORS OF DIFFERENT GRANULAR STRUCTURE ORGANISATIONS.

MULTILAMINATE MODELS SIMULATE THE STRESS STRAIN BEHAVIOUR OF A MATERIAL BY CONSIDERING THE RESPONSE ON SO CALLED INTEGRATION OR SAMPLING PLANES. YIELD AND PLASTIC POTENTIAL FUNCTIONS ARE EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF NORMAL AND SHEAR STRESSES ON THESE INTEGRATION PLANES, AND THUS THE MATHEMATICAL FORMULATIONS REMAIN RELATIVELY SIMPLE EVEN FOR COMPLEX STRAIN HARDENING/ SOFTENING MODELS. THE MODEL INCLUDES A DEVIATORIC YIELD SURFACE WITH A NON ASSOCIATED FLOW RULE AND A VOLUMETRIC YIELD SURFACE WITH AN ASSOCIATED FLOW RULE. INDUCED ANISOTROPY AND THE EFFECT OF ROTATION OF PRINCIPAL STRESS AXES ARE INTRINSICALLY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN MULTILAMINATE MODELS WITHOUT REQUIRING ADDITIONAL MATERIAL PARAMETERS. INHERENT ANISOTROPY CAN BE MODELLED BY INTRODUCING A STRUCTURAL TENSOR. A SLIGHT DISADVANTAGE OF THE MULTILAMINATE APPROACH IS THAT NO FUNCTION FOR A YIELD SURFACE IN THREE DIMENSIONAL STRESS SPACE EXISTS, AND THEREFORE COMPARISON WITH OTHER CONSTITUTIVE MODELS IS DIFFICULT ON A VISUAL BASIS. HOWEVER, IT IS SHOWN THAT THE MODEL PRODUCES APPROXIMATELY A MOHR COULOMB FAILURE SURFACE IN THE DEVIATORIC PLANE, WHICH CAN BE EASILY MODIFIED TO INCORPORATE ANISOTROPIC BEHAVIOUR WITH RESPECT TO STRENGTH, PROVIDING A SIGNIFICANT EXTENSION OF THE MODEL. THE INFLUENCE OF THE INTEGRATION RULE ON THE OBTAINED FAILURE SURFACE IS DISCUSSED. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTAL DATA FROM A COMPREHENSIVE SERIES OF STRESS PATH CONTROLLED TRIAXIAL TESTS ON POKO CLAY SHOWS THE CAPABILITY OF THE APPROACH FOR MODELLING THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF SOFT CLAYS. THE SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE OF THE FORMULATION OF THE FLOW RULE ON THE MODELS PERFORMANCE FOR UNDRAINED TRIAXIAL STRESS PATHS IS DISCUSSED BY COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTAL DATA. FINALLY SOME RESULTS FROM A SLOPE STABILITY ANALYSIS ARE PRESENTED.

THE DISPLACEMENT FIELDS IN THE ANALYSIS ARE TAKEN TO BE THE PRODUCTS OF INDEPENDENT FUNCTIONS THAT VARY IN THE VERTICAL, RADIAL AND CIRCUMFERENTIAL DIRECTIONS. THE GOVERNING DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS FOR THE PILE DEFLECTIONS IN DIFFERENT SOIL LAYERS ARE OBTAINED USING THE PRINCIPLE OF MINIMUM POTENTIAL ENERGY. SOLUTIONS FOR PILE DEFLECTION ARE OBTAINED ANALYTICALLY, WHEREAS THOSE FOR SOIL DISPLACEMENTS ARE OBTAINED USING THE ONE DIMENSIONAL FINITE DIFFERENCE METHOD. THE INPUT PARAMETERS NEEDED FOR THE ANALYSIS ARE THE PILE GEOMETRY, THE SOIL PROFILE, AND THE ELASTIC CONSTANTS OF THE SOIL AND PILE. THE METHOD PRODUCES RESULTS WITH ACCURACY COMPARABLE WITH THAT OF A THREEDIMENSIONAL FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS BUT REQUIRES MUCH LESS COMPUTATION TIME. THE ANALYSIS CAN BE EXTENDED TO ACCOUNT FOR SOIL NON LINEARITY.

WAVE LOADING ON THE MODEL CAISSON WAS SIMULATED ON THE CENTRIFUGE USING AN IN FLIGHT WAVE ACTUATOR SYSTEM. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT REGULAR NON REVERSAL LOADING LEADS TO A RAPID STABILISATION OF MOVEMENTS WITH LOW EXCESS PORE PRESSURE. ON THE OTHER HAND, MUCH LARGER EXCESS PORE PRESSURE AND CAISSON MOVEMENT WERE INDUCED WITHIN MUCH FEWER CYCLES UNDER REVERSAL LOADING. FOR LOOSE SAND BEDS SUBJECTED TO LARGE REVERSAL LOADINGS, LIQUEFACTION WAS OBSERVED ESPECIALLY BENEATH THE HEEL OF THE CAISSON. THE DIFFERENCE IN CAISSON RESPONSE TO NON REVERSAL AND REVERSAL LOADING MAY BE LARGELY ATTRIBUTED TO DIFFERENCES IN SAND BEHAVIOUR UNDER NON REVERSAL AND REVERSAL CYCLIC SHEARING. AS VERY DIFFERENT RESPONSES ARE PRODUCED BY THE TWO TYPES OF LOADING, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT, INSTEAD OF NON REVERSAL LOADING, CAISSON MODEL TESTS SHOULD BE CONDUCTED USING REVERSAL LOADING, WHICH IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF ACTUAL WAVE LOADINGS.

THE FORMULATION CONSIDERS EACH THERMAL, HYDRAULIC AND MECHANICAL PROCESS, AND THEIR VARIOUS INTERACTIONS, THROUGH FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL LAWS AND MODELS. BY EMPLOYING A COMBINATION OF ICE PRESSURE, LIQUID PRESSURE AND TOTAL STRESS AS STATE VARIABLES, A NEW MECHANICAL MODEL HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THAT ENCOMPASSES FROZEN AND UNFROZEN BEHAVIOUR WITHIN A UNIFIED EFFECTIVE STRESS BASED FRAMEWORK. IMPORTANT FROZEN SOIL FEATURES SUCH AS TEMPERATURE AND POROSITY DEPENDENCE OF SHEAR STRENGTH ARE CAPTURED INHERENTLY BY THE MODEL. POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS TO GEOTECHNICS INCLUDE ANALYSIS OF FROST HEAVE, FOUNDATION STABILITY OR MASS MOVEMENTS IN COLD REGIONS. THE MODELS PERFORMANCE IS DEMONSTRATED WITH REFERENCE TO THE IN SITU PIPELINE FROST HEAVE TESTS CONDUCTED BY SLUSARCHUK ET AL. DETAILED CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO FE MESH DESIGN, THE INFLUENCE OF HYDRAULIC PARAMETERS, AND THE TREATMENT OF AIR/GROUND INTERFACE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS. THE THM SIMULATION IS SHOWN TO REPRODUCE, WITH FAIR ACCURACY, THE OBSERVED PIPELINE HEAVE AND THE POROSITY GROWTH DRIVEN BY WATER MIGRATION.

ALTHOUGH SIMPLIFIED METHODS OF CAISSON ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, THEY ARE EITHER FULLY ELASTIC ANALYSES THAT DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR PERMANENT DISPLACEMENT, OR STABILITY ANALYSES THAT DETERMINE WHETHER OVERTURNING WILL OCCUR. IN REALITY, A CAISSON CAN INCUR SIGNIFICANT TILT WITHOUT OVERTURNING: SUCH A PHENOMENON CANNOT BE REPLICATED BY EITHER OF THE ABOVE ANALYSES. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A SIMPLIFIED ANALYSIS THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE ELASTIC CAISSON RESPONSE AS WELL AS THE ACCUMULATION OF PERMANENT TILT WITH SUCCESSIVE WAVE CYCLES. ELASTIC RESPONSE WAS SIMULATED USING A LUMPMASS SPRING MODEL. PERMANENT CAISSON TILT WAS ANALYSED BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION OF THE CAISSON TILTING OVER A CIRCULAR SLIP SURFACE BENEATH ITS BASE. A SEARCH ALGORITHM WAS USED TO DETERMINE THE RADIUS AND DEPTH TO THE CENTRE OF ROTATION OF THE CRITICAL SLIP CIRCLE. PERMANENT TILT IS GENERATED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OVERTURNING AND STABILISING MOMENTS DURING WAVE PEAKS. THIS ALLOWS PERMANENT TILT TO BE ACCUMULATED OVER SUCCESSIVE WAVE PEAKS. COMPARISON WITH CENTRIFUGE TEST DATA SHOWS THAT THE ANALYSIS IS ABLE TO CAPTURE THE PROGRESSIVE BUILD UP OF TILT REASONABLY WELL. FURTHERMORE, COMPARISON WITH A FIELD CASE OF CAISSON FAILURE DURING A STORM SHOWS GOOD CORRELATION, ALTHOUGH UNCERTAINTY OVER THE NUMBER OF WAVE CYCLES PRECLUDES A MORE DIRECT COMPARISON.

J., OFFSHORE ENGINEERING DIVISION, TECHNIP UK LIMITED, UNITED KINGDOM, UNIVERSITY OF DUNDEE, UNITED KINGDOM	THE RESPONSE OF SKIRTED FOUNDATIONS TO COMBINED VERTICAL, HORIZONTAL AND MOMENT LOADING IS IMPORTANT FOR THE DESIGN OF OFFSHORE INSTALLATIONS. THE VERTICAL SKIRTS BENEATH THE FOOTING INTERACT WITH THE SOIL AND INCREASE THE FOUNDATION CAPACITY, COMPARED WITH A SURFACE FOOTING. PREVIOUS RESEARCHERS HAVE ASSUMED THAT THE SOIL WITHIN THE SKIRTS REMAINS RIGID DURING UNDRAINED LOADING, BUT THIS ASSUMPTION HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED RIGOROUSLY. A SERIES OF PLANE STRAIN FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSES HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE DIRECTLY HOW THE SKIRT GEOMETRY AFFECTS THE UNDRAINED STRIP FOUNDATION CAPACITY UNDER COMBINED HORIZONTAL MOMENT LOADING AND THE MECHANISMS OCCURRING AT FAILURE. CONDITIONS OF BOTH UNIFORM AND NON UNIFORM UNDRAINED STRENGTH SOIL HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT DEFORMATION OF THE SOIL BETWEEN EXTERNAL SKIRTS CAN LEAD TO SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FOUNDATION CAPACITY THAN THAT OF AN EQUIVALENT SOLID EMBEDDED FOUNDATION. HENCE THE SPECIFIC GEOMETRY OF THE FOUNDATION MUST BE CONSIDERED IN DESIGN. IN ADDITION, THE FAILURE ENVELOPES FOR SKIRTED FOUNDATIONS WITH DIFFERENT EMBEDMENT RATIOS DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY. THIS MAKES GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FAILURE ENVELOPE SHAPES PROBLEMATICAL. FINALLY, SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN FOUNDATION BEARING CAPACITY MAY BE ACHIEVED BY ADDING AN INTERMEDIATE SKIRT TO THE FOUNDATION, WHICH RESULTS IN A FOUNDATION CAPACITY THAT IS ALMOST EQUAL TO THAT OF A SOLID EMBEDDED FOUNDATION.

MEANWHILE, THE ACCUMULATION OF METEOROLOGICAL DATA AND THE REFINEMENT OF AOGCMS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE IMPROVED THE CONFIDENCE IN FUTURE GLOBAL AIR TEMPERATURE PREDICTIONS. A RELIABLE SCHEME IS NOW DESIRED THAT CONVERTS THESE CLIMATE PREDICTIONS INTO FUTURE GEOCRYOLOGICAL PREDICTIONS RELEVANT TO GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING AND RISK ASSESSMENT. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH THAT PROVIDES A FIRST ESTIMATE OF TRANSIENT GROUND RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE ON A REGIONAL BASIS. THE SCHEME INTEGRATES LOCALLY ADJUSTED AOGCM CLIMATE PREDICTIONS, REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS, NON LINEAR THERMAL FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS AND DIGITAL ELEVATION MODELS DERIVED FROM REMOTE SENSING DATA. THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE APPROACH IS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH PREDICTIONS MADE OF THE GEOCRYOLOGICAL CHANGES EXPECTED BETWEEN 1940 AND 2059 IN A SIBERIAN REGION. THE PAPER PRESENTS RESULTS FROM ONE SAMPLED AREA WHERE DISCONTINUOUS PERMAFROST IS PRESENT BENEATH ROLLING HILLS TERRAIN. IT IS SHOWN THAT ELEVATION, VEGETATION AND LOCAL GEOLOGICAL VARIATIONS ALL AFFECT THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERMAFROST, WITH IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGN AND OPERATION. A RANGE OF USEFUL GEOCRYOLOGICAL MAPS CAN BE OUTPUT FROM THE PROCEDURE, INCLUDING TEMPERATURE AT THE ACTIVE LAYER BASE, PERMAFROST TABLE DEPTH, AND GROUND TEMPERATURE AT ANY DESIRED DEPTH. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE PERMAFROST MODELS PREDICTIONS FOR PRESENT DAY CONDITIONS AGREE WELL WITH EXISTING GEOCRYOLOGICAL MAPS. AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE OF HOW SIMPLE GEOHAZARD MAPS MAY BE PREPARED FROM THE OUTPUT IS ALSO PROVIDED.

A PILE LOADING TEST THAT INCORPORATED TEMPERATURE CYCLES WHILE UNDER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF MAINTAINED LOADING WAS UNDERTAKEN TO INVESTIGATE THE BEHAVIOUR OF AN ENERGY PILE INSTALLED IN LONDON CLAY. TESTING WAS CARRIED OUT OVER A PERIOD OF ABOUT SEVEN WEEKS, WITH CONVENTIONAL LOADING TESTS CARRIED OUT EITHER SIDE OF AN EXTENDED LOADING TEST WITH THERMAL CYCLES. USING AN OPTICAL FIBRE SENSOR SYSTEM, AND OTHER MORE CONVENTIONAL INSTRUMENTATION, TEMPERATURE AND STRAIN PROFILES WERE OBSERVED IN THE TEST PILE, AN ADJACENT BOREHOLE, TWO OF THE ANCHOR PILES, AND THE HEAT SINK PILE. DETAILS OF LOAD AND MOVEMENT AT THE PILE HEAD, OF AMBIENT AIR TEMPERATURE AND OF THE INPUT/OUTPUT TEMPERATURE OF FLUID WITHIN THE HEATING SYSTEM WERE ALSO RECORDED. THERMODYNAMIC BEHAVIOUR OBSERVED DURING THE TEST SUPPORTS THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE PILE ACTS AS AN INFINITELY LONG HEAT SINK/SOURCE, AND THAT THE CONDUCTIVITY VALUES USED FOR THE LONDON CLAY WERE REASONABLE. FORCES MOBILISED IN THE PILE SHAFT AND THE RESISTANCE MOBILISED AT THE PILE/SOIL INTERFACE HAVE BEEN INFERRED FROM THE TEST RESPONSE, AND THE EFFECTS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED USING A SIMPLIFIED MECHANISM. CONCRETE STRESSES ADDITIONAL TO THOSE DUE TO STATIC LOADING ARE GENERATED WHEN THE PILE IS HEATED, AND THE PILE END RESTRAINT CONDITIONS INFLUENCE THE EFFECT; CONCRETE STRESSES COULD POTENTIALLY EXCEED THE LIMITING VALUES IMPOSED BY DESIGN CODES. IN THIS CASE THERE WAS A LARGE MARGIN BETWEEN THE PILE ULTIMATE SHAFT RESISTANCE AND THE SHEAR STRESSES MOBILISED AT THE PILE/SOIL INTERFACE DURING THERMAL CYCLING, AND AS A CONSEQUENCE, IT IS CONSIDERED UNLIKELY THAT THE GEOTECHNICAL CAPACITY OF THE PILE WAS AFFECTED SIGNIFICANTLY.

A DESIGN SIMULATION USING HSTWIN, A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE PACKAGE HST3D, IS COMPARED AGAINST OPERATIONAL DATA COLLECTED OVER A 12 MONTH PERIOD. THESE DATA WERE COLLECTED FOLLOWING 5 YEARS OF OPERATION. THE MAIN CONCLUSION FROM THE CASE STUDY IS THAT THERE IS GOOD AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE HSTWIN SIMULATION AND OPERATIONAL FINDINGS. FURTHERMORE, IT CAN BE INFERRED THAT ACTIVE GROUND THERMAL STORAGE STRATEGIES CAN OFFER IMPROVEMENTS OVER CONVENTIONAL GROUND SOURCE ENERGY SYSTEMS.

FOUR T BAR DIAMETERS AND TWO BALL DIAMETERS WERE INSTALLED IN KAOLIN WITH OVERCONSOLIDATION RATIOS OF 1,2 AND 5 AT PENETRATION VELOCITIES VARYING OVER FIVE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. THE PENETRATION RESISTANCES ARE COMPARED WITH THE PROPERTIES OF KAOLIN AS MEASURED IN ELEMENT TESTS TO ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FRAMEWORK THAT DESCRIBES THIS RESISTANCE OVER THE FULL VELOCITY RANGE. CONSISTENT TRENDS EMERGE WHEN THE SOIL VISCOSITY IS ASSUMED TO AFFECT THE PENETRATION RESISTANCE IN BOTH THE PARTIALLY DRAINED AND UNDRAINED CONDITIONS, ENABLING THE DEPENDENCE OF THE T BAR AND BALL RESISTANCES ON DIAMETER, VELOCITY AND SOIL CHARACTERISTICS TO BE QUANTIFIED.

SIMILARLY, ROCKS HAVE BEEN USED AS DEPOSITORY SITES FOR NUCLEAR WASTE. HIGH TEMPERATURES RESULTING FROM CLIMATIC FLUCTUATIONS, FOR CLAYS, OR FROM HEAT GENERATED BY NUCLEAR WASTE, FOR ROCKS, CAN HAVE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON THEIR HYDRO MECHANICAL PROPERTIES, CAUSING CRACKING. IN CLAYS THIS IS THE RESULT OF DESICCATION; IN ROCKS IT IS THE RESULT OF VARYING EXPANSION BETWEEN MINERAL GRAINS. THE PRESENT STUDY DEALS WITH THE EVOLUTION AND INTERCONNECTIVITY OF CRACKS IN CLAYS AND ROCKS AS A RESULT OF HIGH TEMPERATURES, EVALUATED USING THE FRACTAL DIMENSION CONCEPT.

FOUR CASES OF SUCH HISTORY LEADING TO VARIOUS MODES OF FAILURE ARE IDENTIFIED AND INTERPRETED IN TERMS OF THERMAL CAM CLAY MODELS. PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THE INFLUENCE OF THERMAL VARIABILITY ON THE COEFFICIENT OF THE CRITICAL STATE, M, OR THE ANGLE OF INTERNAL FRICTION. A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE MATERIAL HISTORY OFFERS AN EXPLANATION OF AN APPARENT CONFUSION ABOUT WHETHER THE SOIL STRENGTH IS DECREASED OR INCREASED BY TEMPERATURE. IN A COMPANION PAPER, NUMERICAL ANALYSIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF AXISYMMETRIC THERMAL AND STRESS FIELDS AROUND A CYLINDRICAL HEAT SOURCE SUGGESTS THAT THERMAL FAILURE MAY ARISE IN CONDITIONS THAT ARE FAR FROM ANY MECHANICALLY CRITICAL SITUATION.

NAVIER CERMES, MARNE LA VALLEE, FRANCE	COMPACTED EXPANSIVE CLAYS ARE OFTEN CONSIDERED AS A POSSIBLE BUFFER MATERIAL IN HIGH LEVEL DEEP RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSALS. AFTER THE INSTALLATION OF WASTE CANISTERS, THE ENGINEERED CLAY BARRIERS ARE SUBJECTED TO THERMOHYDROMECHANICAL ACTION IN THE FORM OF WATER INFILTRATION FROM THE GEOLOGICAL BARRIER, HEAT DISSIPATION FROM THE RADIOACTIVE WASTE CANISTERS, AND STRESSES GENERATED BY CLAY SWELLING UNDER ALMOST CONFINED CONDITIONS. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT WORK IS TO DEVELOP A CONSTITUTIVE MODEL THAT IS ABLE TO DESCRIBE THE BEHAVIOUR OF COMPACTED EXPANSIVE CLAYS UNDER THESE COUPLED THERMO HYDROMECHANICAL ACTIONS. THE PROPOSED MODEL IS BASED ON TWO EXISTING MODELS: ONE FOR THE HYDROMECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF COMPACTED EXPANSIVE CLAYS AND ANOTHER FOR THE THERMOMECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF SATURATED CLAYS. THE ELABORATED MODEL HAS BEEN VALIDATED USING THERMO HYDROMECHANICAL TEST RESULTS ON COMPACTED MX80 BENTONITE. COMPARISON BETWEEN THE MODEL PREDICTION AND THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA SHOWS THAT THIS MODEL IS ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE MAIN FEATURES OF VOLUME CHANGES: HEATING AT CONSTANT SUCTION AND PRESSURE INDUCES EITHER EXPANSION OR CONTRACTION; THE MEAN YIELD STRESS CHANGES WITH VARIATIONS OF SUCTION OR TEMPERATURE.

A THERMOELASTICPLASTIC (TEP) MECHANICAL MODEL WAS DEVELOPED UNDER THE FRAMEWORK OF CRITICAL STATE SOIL MECHANICS AND THE MODIFIED CAM CLAY MODEL. IT CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS. THE FIRST PART INVOLVES AN ISOTROPIC TEP MODEL THAT IS ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE THERMALLY INDUCED VOLUME CHANGE OF SATURATED CLAY SPECIMENS UNDER NORMALLY CONSOLIDATED AND OVERCONSOLIDATED CONDITIONS. THIS PART WAS INTRODUCED EARLIER AND VALIDATED BY THE AUTHORS. THE SECOND PART, THE FOCUS OF THIS PAPER, INVOLVES EXTENSION OF THE ISOTROPIC TEP MODEL INTO TRIAXIAL STRESS SPACE. THE MODEL IS SIMPLE ENOUGH TO REQUIRE MERELY A FEW CONSTANTS MORE THAN THOSE OF THE MODIFIED CAM CLAY MODEL. THE ADEQUACY OF THE PROPOSED MODEL HAS BEEN VERIFIED USING THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS FROM THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CLAY REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE.

IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT A NUMBER OF FACTORS MAY INFLUENCE THE INTERFACE SHEAR STRENGTH, SUCH AS THE NORMAL STRESS, SOIL PROPERTIES, SOIL NAIL SURFACE ROUGHNESS, DEGREE OF SATURATION AND GROUTING PRESSURE. SOME INITIAL RESULTS FROM FIELD PULLOUT TESTS ON SOIL NAILS GROUTED UNDER PRESSURE HAVE INDICATED THAT THE GROUTING PRESSURE CONTRIBUTES TO THE PULLOUT RESISTANCE. PRESSURE GROUTING IS A COST EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR INCREASING THE SOIL NAIL PULLOUT RESISTANCE, THUS IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE NAILED STRUCTURE. STUDIES ON THE SOIL NAIL FAILURE MECHANISMS AND QUANTITATIVE DATA FROM TESTS INVESTIGATING HOW GROUTING PRESSURE INFLUENCES THE PULLOUT RESISTANCE ARE, HOWEVER, VERY LIMITED. FIRST, THIS PAPER INTRODUCES A LABORATORY SOIL NAIL PULLOUT BOX WITH FULL INSTRUMENTATION AND A SPECIAL PRESSURE GROUTING DEVICE AND ITS SET UP. SECOND, THE PAPER DESCRIBES THE TEST PROCEDURES AND A PROGRAMME FOR STUDYING THE INFLUENCE OF PRESSURE GROUTING. THE PAPER PRESENTS REPRESENTATIVE TEST RESULTS. THE INFLUENCE OF THE GROUTING PRESSURE TOGETHER WITH OVERBURDEN SOIL PRESSURE ON THE PULLOUT RESISTANCE IS EXAMINED. FROM THE TEST RESULTS, RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PULLOUT RESISTANCE AND GROUTING PRESSURE ARE OBTAINED AND DISCUSSED.

THE REASONS FOR THIS HAVE INCLUDED LOOSE AND UNSTABLE OVERBURDEN AND CONTAMINATED GROUND, WHICH RESULT IN THE USE OF CONCRETE PILES AS AN ECONOMICALLY TECHNICAL SOLUTION. MORE RECENT METHODS HAVE ENABLED CONCRETE PILE FOUNDATIONS TO BECOME AN ECONOMIC OPTION FOR GROUND CONDITIONS THAT WOULD BE OTHERWISE CONSIDERED FOR TRENCH FILL. IT IS ALSO REALISED THAT THE HEAT LOAD OF MODERN RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS HAS REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS, AND WILL FALL FURTHER IN FORTHCOMING YEARS. IT IS NOW CONSIDERED THAT THE RESIDENTIAL ENERGY PILES CAN NOT ONLY BE ECONOMICALLY INSTALLED, BUT CAN ALSO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY HEAT REQUIREMENT, WHICH IS SUSTAINABLE OVER THE LIFE OF THE BUILDING. A TEST PLOT HAS BEEN PRODUCED WITH 21 CONCRETE PILES, 10 M DEEP, WITH A SINGLE U TUBE PIPE IN EACH. A HEAT REJECTION FACILITY WAS DEVISED TO SIMULATE THE HEAT LOAD OF A TWO STOREY, MODERN RESIDENTIAL BUILDING WITH GROUND FLOOR AREA 72 M 2. TESTING OF THE ENERGY PILES HAS BEEN CONDUCTED OVER THE 2007 2008 HEATING SEASON. THE GROUND WAS MONITORED BY THERMOCOUPLES AT DEPTH ALONG EACH PILE, AND ALSO AS AN ARRAY AT VARIOUS DEPTHS AND DISTANCES IN THE GROUND AROUND THE PLOT.

THE DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE OF THE GROUND ELEMENT OF THESE SYSTEMS (BOREHOLES AND GROUND LOOPS) ARE DOMINANT FACTORS IN THE CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS OF THE SYSTEM, YET, AT PRESENT, SUCH SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN SPECIFIED WITH LITTLE GEOTECHNICAL INPUT. THIS PAPER REVIEWS SOME OF THE EXISTING DESIGN APPROACHES FROM A GEOTECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE, AND IDENTIFIES POTENTIAL FAILURE MODES (SHORT TERM, LONG TERM AND REGULATORY RELATED) FOR GROUND ENERGY SYSTEMS. SHORT TERM FAILURES MAY RESULT FROM DEFICIENCIES IN THE CAPACITY OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE FORMING THE GROUND ELEMENT AND/OR FROM POOR CONNECTION BETWEEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE GROUND. LONG TERM FAILURES MAY DERIVE FROM MISESTIMATION OF LOADS AND/OR GROUND PARAMETERS. POSSIBLE FUTURE DIRECTIONS IN THE DESIGN OF GROUND ENERGY SYSTEMS ARE DISCUSSED, AND THE NEED FOR INFORMED GEOTECHNICAL INPUT TO GROUND ENERGY SYSTEM DESIGN IS HIGHLIGHTED.

IN THIS PAPER, THESE EFFECTS HAVE BEEN QUANTIFIED USING A LARGE DEFORMATION FINITE ELEMENT TECHNIQUE, MODELLING BOTH THE STRENGTH ENHANCEMENT OWING TO HIGH STRAIN RATE AND GRADUAL DEGRADATION OF SOIL DURING PENETRATION DISTURBANCE. A PARAMETRIC STUDY CONFIRMED THAT THE SEPARATE FACTORS QUANTIFYING EFFECTS OF HIGH STRAIN RATE AND PARTIAL SOFTENING MAY BE MULTIPLIED TOGETHER TO PREDICT THE COMBINED EFFECT, TO DERIVE A RESISTANCE FACTOR FOR A GIVEN SOIL. SIMPLE EXPRESSIONS ARE PRESENTED ALLOWING THE RESISTANCE FACTORS FOR T BAR AND BALL PENETROMETERS TO BE EXPRESSED AS A FUNCTION OF RATE AND STRAIN SOFTENING PARAMETERS. BY CONSIDERING AVERAGE STRENGTH CONDITIONS DURING PENETRATION AND EXTRACTION OF THESE FULL FLOW PENETROMETERS, AN APPROXIMATE EXPRESSION IS DERIVED THAT ALLOWS ESTIMATION OF THE HYPOTHETICAL RESISTANCE FACTOR WITH NO STRAIN SOFTENING, AND HENCE AN INITIAL ESTIMATE OF THE RATE DEPENDENCY OF THE SOIL.

NUMERICAL MODELLING OF SOIL FREEZING AND ICE SEGREGATION PROCESSES IS PRESENTED, AND COMPARED AGAINST SMALL SCALE PHYSICAL MODELLING EXPERIMENTS. THE COUPLED THM MODEL PRESENTED, WHICH IS SOLVED BY WAY OF A TRANSIENT FINITE ELEMENT APPROACH, CONSIDERS A NUMBER OF PROCESSES, INCLUDING CONDUCTION, CONVECTION, PHASE CHANGE, THE MOVEMENT OF MOISTURE DUE TO CRYOGENIC SUCTIONS, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ICE LENSES. TWO SEASONAL FREEZING SCENARIOS ARE CONSIDERED: (A) FOR SOILS WITH NO PERMAFROST, WHERE FREEZING IS FROM THE SURFACE DOWNWARD (ONE SIDED FREEZING); AND (B) FOR SOILS UNDERLAIN BY PERMAFROST, WHERE LARGE THERMAL GRADIENTS IN THE UPPERMOST PERMAFROST LAYER CAN CAUSE ACTIVE LAYER FREEZING IN TWO DIRECTIONS, FROM THE PERMAFROST TABLE UPWARDS AND FROM THE GROUND SURFACE DOWNWARDS (TWO SIDED FREEZING). IN THE CASE OF ONE SIDED FREEZING, ICE LENS FORMATION OCCURS AS THE FREEZING FRONT ADVANCES DOWNWARDS FROM THE SURFACE, AND IS LIMITED BY WATER SUPPLY. HOWEVER, DURING TWO SIDED FREEZING, ICE SEGREGATION TAKES PLACE IN A CLOSED SYSTEM, WITH ICE LENSES ACCUMULATING AT THE BASE OF THE ACTIVE LAYER AND NEAR THE GROUND SURFACE, LEAVING AN INTERVENING ICE POOR ZONE. NUMERICAL MODELLING IS ABLE TO REPRESENT THE DEVELOPMENT OF BOTH THE THERMAL FIELD AND ICE SEGREGATION OBSERVED IN THE PHYSICAL MODELS. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS CONTRASTING GROUND ICE DISTRIBUTION IS CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF THAW RELATED SLOW MASS MOVEMENT PROCESSES (SOLIFLUCTION).

THE SPUDCAN WAS ASSUMED TO BE WISHED IN PLACE. TO SIMULATE THE EFFECT OF INSTALLATION, ASSUMPTIONS WERE MADE TO APPROXIMATE THE STRESS FIELD AND EXCESS PORE WATER PRESSURE FIELD IN THE SOIL ABOVE THE SPUDCAN, AND FOR THE EFFECT OF INSTALLATION BENEATH THE SPUDCAN, LOAD WAS APPLIED ON THE SPUDCAN UNTIL BEARING FAILURE OF THE SOIL WAS ACHIEVED. THEREAFTER, THE MAXIMUM INSTALLATION LOAD (PRELOAD) WAS REDUCED TO THE MAINTAINED VERTICAL LOAD, AND CONSOLIDATION OF THE SOIL WAS ALLOWED TO OCCUR TO SIMULATE THE WAITING (OPERATIONAL) PERIOD OF THE SPUDCAN. IN SPITE OF THE SIMPLIFYING ASSUMPTIONS MADE IN THE FINITE ELEMENT MODEL, THE RESULTS SHOW AN ENCOURAGING MEASURE OF AGREEMENT WITH THE CENTRIFUGE TESTS RESULTS OF PURWANA ET AL. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BASE SUCTION IN THE EXTRACTION OF THE SPUDCAN IS FURTHER DEMONSTRATED. PARAMETRIC STUDIES USING MARINE CLAY PROPERTIES SHOW THAT THE RATIO OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BREAKOUT FORCE AND THE TOP SOIL RESISTANCE AT BREAKOUT OVER THE MAXIMUM INSTALLATION LOAD DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE SOIL PROPERTIES AND THE WAITING TIME AFTER ADJUSTING FOR THE EFFECT OF THE GEOMETRIC SIZE OF THE SPUDCAN. HENCE THIS MAY BE A PLAUSIBLE WAY TO ESTIMATE THE FORCE REQUIRED FOR THE EXTRACTION OF SPUDCANS EMBEDDED IN SOFT CLAY.

THE TECHNOLOGY IS BASED ON ABSORBER PIPES INSTALLED WITHIN CONCRETE ELEMENTS AND A HEAT CARRIER FLUID CIRCULATED THROUGH THE SYSTEM; HEAT IS EXTRACTED FROM THE GROUND OR STORED IN THE GROUND FOR HEATING AND COOLING OF ASSOCIATED BUILDINGS. THIS PROMISING TECHNOLOGY LEADS TO A REDUCTION OF FOSSIL ENERGY CONSUMPTION AT MODERATE INSTALLATION AND LOW OPERATION COSTS.

THE T Z METHOD IS A WIDELY USED SOIL STRUCTURE INTERACTION MODEL FOR THE ANALYSIS OF DRILLED SHAFT SETTLEMENT. IN CURRENT PRACTICE, NOMINAL VALUES OF SOIL STIFFNESS AND STRENGTH PARAMETERS ARE USED TO DETERMINE SETTLEMENT BASED UPON THE T Z METHOD. HOWEVER, THE NOMINAL VALUES CAN VARY FROM ONE DESIGNER TO ANOTHER, MAKING THE RESULTS SOMEWHAT INCONSISTENT. BY CONSIDERING RELIABILITY BASED DESIGN PRINCIPLES, PROBABILISTIC RELATIONSHIPS CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO THE SETTLEMENT ANALYSIS OF THE DRILLED SHAFT, AND THUS DESIGN UNCERTAINTY CAN BE QUANTIFIED. FOLLOWING THIS APPROACH, LOAD AND RESISTANCE FACTOR DESIGN (LRFD) PROCEDURES MAY BE UTILISED AND RESISTANCE FACTORS ESTABLISHED FOR USE IN DESIGN. USING A T Z MODEL AND THE MONTE CARLO SIMULATION PROCESS, PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS ARE DETERMINED FOR DRILLED SHAFT CAPACITY AT THE SERVICE LIMIT STATE. RESISTANCE FACTORS ARE CALCULATED BASED UPON THESE RELATIONSHIPS. THE DRILLED SHAFT GEOMETRY AND THE SHAFT/SOIL INTERFACE PARAMETERS ARE VARIED SO THAT THEIR EFFECTS ON THE RESISTANCE FACTORS MAY BE UNDERSTOOD.

A SIMPLE DEFINITION OF FORM WAS ADOPTED, AND A METHOD OF MEASURING FORM WAS PROPOSED FOR COARSE PARTICULATES, AND APPLIED TO A RANGE OF MATERIALS. THIS PAPER CONSIDERS THE FORM OF FINE PARTICULATE MATERIALS. IT REVIEWS THE EVOLUTION OF THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF CLASTIC AND CRUSHED ROCK PARTICLES, AND EXAMINES THE APPLICABILITY OF METHODS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN OTHER FIELDS FOR DETERMINING THE FORM OF FINE PARTICLES. A NEW METHOD OF DETERMINING FORM, BASED ON TURBIDITY MEASUREMENT AND LASER DIFFRACTION PARTICLE SIZING, IS PROPOSED AND APPLIED TO SEVEN DIFFERENT MATERIALS WITH WIDELY VARYING FORM.

LOCAL AND GLOBAL SUFFICIENT STABILITY CRITERIA ALLOW DETECTING AND DESCRIBING THE INSTABILITY PHENOMENA, RESPECTIVELY, AT THE MATERIAL POINT LEVEL AND FOR THE WHOLE DOMAIN. BY CONSIDERING THE NON ASSOCIATED PLASOL ELASTOPLASTIC CONSTITUTIVE MODEL AND THE SECOND ORDER WORK CRITERION, IT IS SHOWN THAT UNSTABLE STRESS STRAIN STATES CAN BE REACHED IN PLANE STRAIN CONDITIONS, STRICTLY INSIDE THE PLASTIC LIMIT CRITERION. THE TWO LANDSLIDES THAT OCCURRED IN PETACCIATO AND TREVOUX ARE THEN ANALYSED BY MODELLING UNSATURATED HYDRO MECHANICAL COUPLING. THE ANALYSIS IS CARRIED OUT USING THE LAGAMINE FINITE ELEMENT CODE. THIS ORIGINAL APPROACH TO SLOPE STABILITY ANALYSIS MAKES IT POSSIBLE SUCCESSFULLY TO EXHIBIT THE LANDSLIDE MECHANISM OBSERVED ON THESE SLOPES AFTER A LONG RAINY PERIOD: THIS COULD NOT BE DESCRIBED WITH THE CLASSICAL METHODS.

THIS PARTICLE SHAPE CHARACTERISTIC HAS BEEN TERMED FORM, WHICH HAS SOMETIMES BEEN ESTIMATED ON THE BASIS OF SPHERICITY, A MEASURE OF HOW CLOSE A GIVEN PARTICLE FORM COMES TO THAT OF A SPHERE. TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF FORM IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE SIMPLE, PRACTICAL, AND ROBUST THREE DIMENSIONAL MEASURES OF THIS ASPECT OF PARTICLE SHAPE. THIS PAPER REVIEWS EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF PARTICLE FORM, AND EXAMINES PREVIOUS DEFINITIONS OF IT. IT THEN CONSIDERS POTENTIAL METHODS OF OBTAINING DATA TO DEFINE THE THREE DIMENSIONAL FORM OF COARSE PARTICLES, AND PROPOSES A PRACTICAL METHOD (BASED ON A VOLUMETRIC EQUIVALENT SCALENE ELLIPSOID) BY WHICH THIS CAN BE DONE. THE PROPOSED METHOD IS APPLIED TO SPECIMENS WITH DIFFERENT PARTICLE SHAPES, AND THE RESULTS ARE ASSESSED BY COMPARISON WITH OTHER POSSIBLE MEASURES OF FORM, AND AGAINST THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM ORTHOGONAL MEASUREMENTS MADE USING STATIC IMAGING.

VISCOSITIES OF SOILS WITH WATER CONTENTS GREATER THAN THE LIQUID LIMIT HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED USING VISCOMETERS. THERE IS, HOWEVER, NO STANDARD METHOD TO DETERMINE SHEAR VISCOSITIES OF CLAYS AT WATER CONTENTS LOWER THAN THE LIQUID LIMIT. IN THIS PAPER, THE POST FAILURE (CRITICAL STATE) RESPONSE OF FINEGRAINED SOILS IS MODELLED AS IF THEY WERE VISCO PLASTIC FLUIDS. IN ADDITION, THE THEORY OF THE FALL CONE TEST, CURRENTLY USED TO INTERPRET THE INDEX AND STRENGTH PROPERTIES OF FINE GRAINED SOILS, IS RE EVALUATED TO DISCERN THE VISCOUS DRAG AS THE CONE PENETRATES THE SOIL. THIS REEVALUATION SHOWS THAT THE SHEAR VISCOSITIES OF CLAYS AT LIQUIDITY INDICES LESS THAN 1.5 CAN BE ESTIMATED FROM A CONTINUOUS RECORD OF TIME CONE PENETRATION DEPTH DATA. FALL CONE TEST RESULTS ON KAOLIN SHOW THAT THE SHEAR VISCOSITY DECREASES EXPONENTIALLY WITH INCREASE IN LIQUIDITY INDICES.

INSTABILITY OF UNSATURATED SOIL SLOPES IS CAUSED BY THE DOWNWARDS PROGRESSION OF A WETTING FRONT, WHICH REDUCES THE NEAR SURFACE SUCTIONS, INCREASES THE WEIGHT OF SOIL IN THE FAILURE ZONE AND REDUCES THE SOIL STRENGTH. ASSUMING THE SLIP SURFACE FORMS PARALLEL TO THE SLOPE SURFACE (AT A DEPTH EQUAL TO THE WETTING FRONT DEPTH) THE PROBABILITY OF FAILURE IS DETERMINED IN THIS PAPER THROUGH THE RELIABILITY INDEX DETERMINED USING A COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT GENETIC ALGORITHM METHOD.

THE EXPERIMENTS CONSISTED MAINLY OF SUCTION MONITORED TRIAXIAL TESTS, CARRIED OUT IN A NEW APPARATUS. THE TEST RESULTS ARE INTERPRETED ON THE BASIS OF AN ELASTO PLASTIC FRAMEWORK USING THE CONVENTIONAL STRESS VARIABLE APPROACH (NET STRESS AND SUCTION) AS WELL AS AN APPROACH THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE DEGREE OF SATURATION WITHIN TWO MODIFIED STRESS VARIABLES. THE EVIDENCE FOR CRITICAL STATES WAS EXAMINED, BASED ON THE STRESS DILATANCY RELATIONSHIPS. IT WAS FOUND THAT A CRITICAL STATE WAS OBSERVED EXPERIMENTALLY IN CASES WHERE THE SAMPLES CONTRACTED OVER MUCH OF THEIR STRESS PATHS, BUT WAS NOT TRULY ESTABLISHED IN OTHER CASES. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE SHEAR STRENGTH AND SPECIFIC VOLUME AT THE ULTIMATE STATE WERE ESTABLISHED FOR SAMPLES OVER A WIDE RANGE OF DEGREES OF SATURATION (FROM FULLY SATURATED TO THE AIR DRIED STATE).  2009 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

P., DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, BEIHANG UNIVERSITY, BEIJING, CHINA; HOU, W.; ZHOU, A. N.	BASED ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CURRENT YIELD SURFACE AND THE REFERENCE YIELD SURFACE, A NEW MODEL, CALLED THE THREE DIMENSIONAL UNIFIED HARDENING MODEL FOR OVER CONSOLIDATED CLAYS (THE UH MODEL), IS PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER. A CURRENT YIELD SURFACE IS USED TO DESCRIBE OVER CONSOLIDATED BEHAVIOUR, AND A REFERENCE YIELD SURFACE TO DESCRIBE THE YIELD CHARACTERISTICS CORRESPONDING TO NORMALLY CONSOLIDATED CLAYS. THE UH MODEL CAN MODEL MANY CHARACTERISTICS OF OVERCONSOLIDATED CLAYS WELL, INCLUDING STRESS STRAIN RELATIONSHIPS, SHEAR DILATANCY, STRAIN HARDENING AND SOFTENING, AND STRESS PATH DEPENDENCE BEHAVIOUR. THE KEY FEATURE OF THE MODEL IS THE ADOPTION OF A UNIFIED HARDENING PARAMETER THAT IS INDEPENDENT OF STRESS PATHS. BASED ON THE SMP CRITERION AND THE CORRESPONDING TRANSFORMED STRESS METHOD, THE PROPOSED MODEL CAN BE APPLIED CONVENIENTLY TO THREE DIMENSIONAL STRESS STATES. COMPARED WITH THE CAM CLAY MODEL, THE UH MODEL REQUIRES ONLY ONE ADDITIONAL CLAY PARAMETER, THE SLOPE OF THE HVORSLEV ENVELOPE. THE VALIDITY OF THIS NEW MODEL IS CONFIRMED BY DATA FROM TRIAXIAL DRAINED AND UNDRAINED COMPRESSION AND EXTENSION TESTS FOR CLAYS WITH DIFFERENT OVERCONSOLIDATION RATIOS, TRUE TRIAXIAL TESTS WITH DIFFERENT LODES ANGLES, AND CYCLIC LOADING TESTS.  2009 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

EQUAL STRAIN CONDITIONS ARE ASSUMED IN THE ANALYSIS. THE NOVEL ADOPTION OF MATERIAL PROPERTIES THAT VARY IN A LINEAR FASHION WITH DEPTH ALLOWS ARBITRARY DISTRIBUTIONS OF PROPERTIES TO BE MODELLED. BY INCORPORATING SURCHARGE AND VACUUM LOADING THAT VARY WITH BOTH DEPTH AND TIME, A WIDE RANGE OF CONSOLIDATION PROBLEMS CAN BE ANALYSED. THE SPECTRAL METHOD IS A MESHLESS APPROACH PRODUCING A SERIES SOLUTION TO THE CONSOLIDATION PROBLEM BASED ON MATRIX OPERATIONS. ACCURACY CAN BE IMPROVED BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF TERMS USED IN THE SERIES SOLUTION. THE MODEL IS VERIFIED BY THE ANALYSIS OF SELECTED CASE STUDIES CHARACTERISED BY: ANALYTICAL FREE STRAIN CONSOLIDATION WITH THIN SAND LAYERS (SURCHARGE ONLY); LABORATORY TEST AND EMBANKMENT TRIAL WITH SURCHARGE AND VACUUM LOADING; AND GROUND SUBSIDENCE CAUSED BY GROUNDWATER PUMPING.  2009 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

FOR THE REINFORCED SAND, 24 MM LONG POLYPROPYLENE FIBRES WERE ADDED, A CONCENTRATION OF 0.5% BY DRY WEIGHT. THE ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS INDICATES THAT THE SOIL LOAD SETTLEMENT BEHAVIOUR IS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY THE FIBRE INCLUSION, CHANGING THE KINEMATICS OF FAILURE. THE BEST PERFORMANCE WAS OBTAINED FOR THE DENSEST (DR 90%) FIBRE SAND MIXTURE, WHERE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE LOAD SETTLEMENT BEHAVIOUR WAS OBSERVED AT VERY SMALL (ALMOST ZERO) DISPLACEMENTS. HOWEVER, FOR THE LOOSE TO MEDIUM DENSE SAND (DR 30% AND 50%), SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENTS (50 MM AND 30 MM RESPECTIVELY) WERE REQUIRED FOR THE DIFFERENCES IN THE LOAD SETTLEMENT RESPONSES TO APPEAR. THE SETTLEMENT REQUIRED FOR THIS DIVERGENCE TO OCCUR COULD BEST BE REPRESENTED USING A LOGARITHMIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SETTLEMENT AND RELATIVE DENSITY. THE OVERALL BEHAVIOUR SEEMS TO SUPPORT THE ARGUMENT THAT INCLUSION OF FIBRES INCREASES STRENGTH OF SANDY SOIL BY A MECHANISM THAT INVOLVES THE PARTIAL SUPPRESSION OF DILATION (AND HENCE PRODUCES AN INCREASE IN EFFECTIVE CONFINING PRESSURE, AND A CONSEQUENT INCREASE IN SHEAR STRENGTH).  2009 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

THE EFFECTIVE MAJOR STRESS AT CONSOLIDATION SIGMA1C IS FOUND TO SERVE AS A PRIMARY PARAMETER IN DEFINING A SERIES OF CHARACTERISTIC STATE LINES AND UNDRAINED STRENGTH RATIOS. THE LARGEST POSSIBLE UNDRAINED STRENGTH RATIO SUS/SIGMA 1C UNDER FLOW DEFORMATION WAS FOUND NOT TO DIFFER LARGELY AMONG SOILS, THOUGH THE RANGE OF SUCH INITIAL DENSITY CONDITIONS DIFFERS. THE ESTIMATION OF UNDRAINED STRENGTH WOULD THEREFORE BE PRACTICALLY USEFUL IN DETERMINING THE OCCURRENCE OF FLOW DEFORMATION.  2009 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A NUMBER OF DRAINED CYCLIC TRIAXIAL TESTS ON LOOSE, UNIFORMLY GRADED SAMPLES OF DOGS BAY CARBONATE SAND. IT IS OBSERVED THAT PARTICLE BREAKAGE IS DEPENDENT ON STRESS LEVEL, CYCLIC STRESS RATIO, AND CREEP AND IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO VOLUMETRIC STRAIN. DRAINED CYCLING INCREASES VOLUMETRIC STRAIN AND THEREFORE MORE BREAKAGE OCCURS WHEN LARGER NUMBERS OF CYCLES ARE IMPOSED. THE INCREASE IN PARTICLE BREAKAGE FROM ONE CYCLE TO THE NEXT INDICATES THAT WHILE PARTICLES MAY NOT BE LOADED TO THEIR FULL CAPACITY IN A GIVEN CYCLE, THEY CAN BE CRUSHED IN SUBSEQUENT CYCLES WITHOUT ANY VARIATION IN THE AMPLITUDE OF CYCLIC LOADING.  2009 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

IF IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT POTENTIAL EVAPORATION FROM THE LANDFILL SURFACE WILL EXCEED AVERAGE ANNUAL RAINFALL, IT IS ACCEPTED THAT NO SIGNIFICANT LEACHATE WILL BE GENERATED IN THE LANDFILL, AND A LEACHATE COLLECTION SYSTEM, IMPERVIOUS UNDERLINER AND LEACHATE TREATMENT SYSTEM IS NOT LEGALLY REQUIRED. THIS REPRESENTS VERY LARGE FINANCIAL SAVINGS ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW LANDFILL OR THE EXTENSION OF AN EXISTING ONE. HENCE THE MEASUREMENT AND PREDICTION OF EVAPORATION FROM A SOIL SURFACE HAS BECOME A SUBJECT OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE TO THE WASTE DISPOSAL INDUSTRIES IN SOUTH AFRICA AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES (E.G. BOTSWANA AND NAMIBIA) THAT HAVE ADOPTED SIMILAR CLIMATIC APPROACHES. OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS IT HAS BECOME APPARENT THAT THE LONG ESTABLISHED SOLAR ENERGY BALANCE APPROACH TO ASSESSING EVAPORATION FROM A SOIL MAY BE IN ERROR. THIS IS BECAUSE IT REGARDS SOLAR ENERGY EXPENDED ON HEATING THE SOIL AS REDUCING THE ENERGY AVAILABLE FOR SUPPLYING ENERGY OF EVAPORATION. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES EXPERIMENTS AIMED AT EXPLORING THE ROLE OF HEATING OF THE SOIL IN THE EVAPORATION PROCESS, AND CONCLUDES THAT, FAR FROM SUBTRACTING ENERGY FROM THE PROCESS, IT ACTUALLY PROVIDES MOST OF THE ENERGY FOR EVAPORATION.  2009 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

FURTHERMORE, GROUND HEAT TRANSFER IS UNDERSTOOD TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE OVERALL THERMAL PERFORMANCE OF BUILDINGS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF AN IN DEPTH INVESTIGATION OF HEAT TRANSFER FROM BUILDINGS TO THE GROUND. THE RESEARCH INVOLVED IN SITU MEASUREMENTS OF HEAT TRANSFER TO THE GROUND FROM FULL SCALE BUILDINGS. THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN UTILISED TO HELP DEVELOP AND VALIDATE SUITABLE PREDICTIVE TOOLS TO AID THERMAL DESIGN. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN THAT REVEAL THE TRANSIENT FORM OF ENERGY LOSSES FROM TYPICAL BUILDINGS TO THE GROUND OVER A SEASONAL TIME FRAME. COMPARISONS ARE MADE BETWEEN NUMERICAL RESULTS AND MEASURED DATA OVER AN ANNUAL CYCLE. OVERALL, GOOD CORRELATION OF RESULTS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED. THE THERMAL PROPERTIES OF FOUNDATION SOILS ARE KNOWN TO BE DEPENDENT ON WATER CONTENT. A PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM IS ALSO CONSIDERED. IN PARTICULAR, IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT AN INCREASE IN SOIL MOISTURE CONTENT MAY CAUSE AN INCREASE IN HEAT FLUX OF OVER 20 FOR A TWO DIMENSIONAL TEST CASE. IN SUMMARY, INNOVATIVE LOW ENERGY SUSTAINABLE DESIGN IS RECEIVING INCREASING ATTENTION. THE CURRENT WORK WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THIS OVERALL OBJECTIVE BY ENSURING THAT ADEQUATE ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO SUBSURFACE HEAT TRANSFER.  2009 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

IN THE EXPERIMENT, HEATERS ARE EMPLACED IN THE AXIS OF A TUNNEL EXCAVATED IN GRANITE TO SIMULATE THE HEAT PRODUCTION OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE. THE TEST IS FULLY INSTRUMENTED, AND ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ON THE THERMO HYDRO MECHANICAL (THM) BEHAVIOUR OF THE NEAR FIELD REGION CONSTITUTED BY THE COMPACTED BENTONITE BARRIER SURROUNDING THE HEATER AND THE IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT ROCK. INTERPRETATION OF THE TEST IS ASSISTED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF A COUPLED NUMERICAL ANALYSIS BASED ON A FORMULATION THAT INCORPORATES THE RELEVANT THM PHENOMENA. INITIAL AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR THE ANALYSIS AS WELL AS MATERIAL PARAMETERS ARE DETERMINED FROM AN EXTENSIVE PROGRAMME OF FIELD AND LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS. THE PAPER PRESENTS AND DISCUSSES THE THERMAL, HYDRAULIC AND MECHANICAL OBSERVATIONS IN THE BENTONITE BARRIER AND IN THE HOST ROCK. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE PROGRESS OF HYDRATION IN THE BARRIER, TO THE EFFECTS OF HEATING AND VAPOUR TRANSPORT, AND TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SWELLING PRESSURES IN THE BARRIER. AFTER FIVE YEARS OF HEATING, ONE OF THE HEATERS WAS SWITCHED OFF AND THE EXPERIMENT WAS PARTIALLY DISMANTLED, ALLOWING THE FINAL STATE OF THE BARRIER TO BE OBSERVED DIRECTLY. THE NUMERICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED HAS PROVED ABLE TO REPRESENT THE PROGRESS OF THE EXPERIMENT VERY SATISFACTORILY. IN ADDITION, PREDICTIONS CONCERNING THE FINAL STATE OF THE CLAY BARRIER ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE OBSERVATIONS OBTAINED DURING DISMANTLING. THE PERFORMANCE AND ANALYSIS OF THE IN SITU TEST HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED THE UNDERSTANDING OF A COMPLEX THM PROBLEM AND HAVE PROVED THE CAPABILITY OF THE NUMERICAL FORMULATION TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE PREDICTIVE CAPACITY.  2009 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

THIS PAPER REVEALS A NEW APPROACH TO ESTIMATE THETAQ FROM MEASURED K RECORDS. FIRST, AN EQUATION THAT RELATES THE NORMALISED K OF SOIL (KE) TO THE DEGREE OF SATURATION SR IS FITTED TO EXPERIMENTAL K DATA, AND THE K AT FULL SATURATION IS ASSESSED; THEN THETAQ IS CALCULATED FROM A GEOMETRIC MEAN MODEL. THIS MODELLING APPROACH WAS APPLIED TO THE K DATA OF 10 CHINESE SOILS OBTAINED BY LU ET AL., ALSO CONTAINING K MEASUREMENTS AT FULL DRYNESS, AND TO SOILS INVESTIGATED BY KERSTEN WITH MEASURED QUARTZ CONTENT DATA. THE FITTED THETAQ DATA FOR CHINESE SOILS ARE NOTICEABLY DIFFERENT FROM THE SAND MASS FRACTION, COMMONLY ASSUMED IN THE PAST AS AN EQUIVALENT OF QUARTZ CONTENT, CONSEQUENTLY LEADING TO IRRATIONAL K ESTIMATES. ACCEPTABLY GOOD AGREEMENT WAS OBTAINED BETWEEN FITTED AND MEASURED QUARTZ CONTENT FOR KERSTENS SOILS. FIVE KE(S R) FUNCTIONS WERE TESTED AGAINST THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA FOR TEN CHINESE SOILS, SUPPLEMENTED WITH CALCULATED K AT FULL SATURATION. OVERALL, THE NORMALISED FUNCTION BY LU ET AL. WAS THE MOST SUITABLE FOR THE SOILS TESTED. THE ASSUMPTION THAT KE(SR) 0, APPLIED TO JOHANSENS MODEL EXTENDED TO FULL DRYNESS, WORKED WELL FOR FINE SOILS, AND WAS ACCEPTABLE FOR COARSE SOILS.  2009 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

THE INITIAL THERMO HYDRO MECHANICAL (THM) EVOLUTION IN THE CLAY BARRIER WAS INVESTIGATED IN A SEPARATE MOCK UP TEST. THE PAPER DESCRIBES THIS LABORATORY EXPERIMENT AND THE CORRESPONDING NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS. MOST OF THE RELATED WORK REFERS TO THM ANALYSES OF BENTONITE BARRIERS WELL BELOW 100C, BUT HERE HIGHER TEMPERATURES ARE CONSIDERED. A 20 CM CLOSED SPECIMEN OF COMPACTED MX 80 BENTONITE WAS SUBJECTED TO A TEMPERATURE GRADIENT (84C AND 120C AT THE END POINTS). THE EVOLUTION OF TEMPERATURE, RELATIVE HUMIDITY, PORE PRESSURE AND STRESSES WAS MONITORED AT SEVERAL POINTS. THE TEST WAS ALLOWED TO REACH STEADY STATE CONDITIONS. THE SPECIMEN WAS THEN SAMPLED AND ANALYSED IN TERMS OF WATER CONTENT AND BULK DENSITY. SEVERAL FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSES CONSIDERING DIFFERENT COUPLED THM INTERACTIONS WERE PERFORMED, AND COMPARED WITH MEASUREMENTS. BENTONITE PROPERTIES WERE OBTAINED FROM INDEPENDENT TESTS. ADDITIONALLY, RETENTION PROPERTIES WERE ALSO OBTAINED FROM MEASURED SATURATION RATIOS AND STEADY STATE SUCTION VALUES. FOR THE MECHANICAL PROBLEM THE BARCELONA EXPANSIVE MODEL WAS USED, WHICH INCLUDES EXPLICITLY THE TWO STRUCTURAL LEVELS THAT ACTUALLY EXIST IN EXPANSIVE CLAYS (MACRO AND MICROSTRUCTURE). THIS MODEL MADE IT POSSIBLE TO SIMULATE THE EVOLUTION OF STRESSES AS WELL AS THE EXPANSION OF BENTONITE AT THE COLD SIDE AND THE COMPRESSION AT THE HOT SIDE, USING A SINGLE SET OF PARAMETERS.  2009 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

THE UNDERGROUND RESEARCH FACILITY HADES HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED TO ENABLE VARIOUS IN SITU EXPERIMENTS TO BE PERFORMED ON BOOM CLAY SO AS TO STUDY THE FEASIBILITY OF HIGH LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL, AND TO PROVIDE RELIABLE DATA ON THE PERFORMANCE OF BOOM CLAY AS A HOST FORMATION. AMONG THE VARIOUS LABORATORY STUDIES PERFORMED ON SAMPLES EXTRACTED FROM THE HADES FACILITY TO INVESTIGATE THE THERMO HYDRO MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF BOOM CLAY, RELATIVELY FEW WERE DEVOTED TO THE TIME DEPENDENT BEHAVIOUR, LIMITING ANY RELEVANT ANALYSIS OF THE LONG TERM BEHAVIOUR OF THE DISPOSAL FACILITY. THE PRESENT WORK AIMS AT INVESTIGATING THE TIME DEPENDENT BEHAVIOUR OF BOOM CLAY UNDER BOTH THERMAL AND MECHANICAL LOADING. HIGH PRESSURE TRIAXIAL TESTS AT CONTROLLED TEMPERATURES WERE CARRIED OUT FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE TESTS STARTED WITH CONSTANT RATE THERMAL AND/OR MECHANICAL CONSOLIDATION AND ENDED WITH ISOBAR HEATING AND/OR ISOTHERMAL COMPRESSION AT A CONSTANT STRESS RATE OR BY STEP LOADING. THE RESULTS OBTAINED CONFIRMED THE EFFECT OF THE OVERCONSOLIDATION RATIO (OCR) ON THE THERMAL VOLUME CHANGES (I.E. THERMAL DILATION UNDER HIGH OCRS AND THERMAL CONTRACTION WITH OCR CLOSE TO UNITY). SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE AS WELL AS OF COMPRESSION AND HEATING RATES WERE ALSO OBSERVED ON THE VOLUME CHANGE BEHAVIOUR. AFTER BEING LOADED TO A STRESS LOWER THAN THE PRECONSOLIDATION PRESSURE (5 MPA) AT A LOW TEMPERATURE OF 25C AND AT A RATE LOWER THAN 0.2 KPA/MIN, THE SAMPLE VOLUME CHANGES SEEMED TO BE QUITE SMALL, SUGGESTING A FULL DISSIPATION OF PORE WATER PRESSURE. BY CONTRAST, AFTER BEING SUBJECTED TO HIGH LOADING AND HEATING RATES (INCLUDING STEP LOADING OR STEP HEATING), THE VOLUME CHANGES APPEARED TO BE SIGNIFICANT, PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF STRESSES MUCH HIGHER THAN THE PRECONSOLIDATION PRESSURE. BECAUSE OF ITS LOW PERMEABILITY, FULL CONSOLIDATION OF BOOM CLAY REQUIRED A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH CONSOLIDATION AND CREEP FROM THE TOTAL VOLUME CHANGE WITH TIME.  2009 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

A THERMO HYDRAULIC STAINLESS STEEL CELL, CAPABLE OF TESTING UNDISTURBED SOIL OR ROCK CORES 70 MM IN DIAMETER AND 100 MM LONG, HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND USED TO IDENTIFY THERMAL PROPERTIES (CONDUCTION COEFFICIENT, HEAT CAPACITY, THERMAL EXPANSION), PERMEABILITY (DERIVED FROM GAS AND WATER TESTS) AND SWELLING BEHAVIOUR. THE CELL IS OPERATED IN A CONSTANT TEMPERATURE BATH. MINIATURE PORE WATER PRESSURE TRANSDUCERS AND THERMOCOUPLES ARE INSTALLED IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS OF THE SPECIMEN. STRAIN GAUGES ATTACHED TO A REDUCED THICKNESS RING SECTION OF THE CELL PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR SWELLING PRESSURE DETERMINATIONS. TEMPERATURE CHANGES ARE APPLIED BY A THIN HEATER CENTRED IN THE AXIS OF THE SPECIMEN. A COMPUTER CODE WAS SPECIFICALLY WRITTEN TO PERFORM AND CONTROL EXPERIMENTS. AIR PERMEABILITY IS DETERMINED BY MEANS OF A PULSE DECAY TECHNIQUE, WHEREAS LIQUID PERMEABILITY IS DIRECTLY INTERPRETED AT STEADY STATE CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, BACK ANALYSIS OF THE COMPLETE MEASURED RESPONSE OF THE SPECIMEN (PORE PRESSURES, TEMPERATURES AND SWELLING PRESSURES) PROVIDES THE BEST PROCEDURE FOR IDENTIFYING PROPERTIES. A TESTING PROTOCOL INVOLVING A SEQUENCE OF UNDRAINED AND DRAINED HEATING TESTS HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO DETERMINE, IN AN ORDERED WAY, THE THERMAL PROPERTIES AND THE PERMEABILITY. THE PROCEDURE REQUIRES THE CONCOURSE OF A COUPLED THERMO HYDRO MECHANICAL CODE IN ORDER TO SIMULATE TEST RESULTS. THE PROGRAM CODE BRIGHT, DEVELOPED AT UPC, WAS USED FOR THESE PURPOSES. THE PROCEDURE WAS APPLIED TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE THERMAL PROPERTIES OF OPALINUS CLAY SHALE.  2009 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

THE WORK CAN BE SEEN AS AN EXTENSION OF THE AUTHORS PREVIOUS RESEARCH, INVESTIGATING THE BEHAVIOUR OF A LARGE SCALE TEST, THE SO CALLED ISOTHERMAL TEST, TO NOW INCLUDE HEATING EFFECTS. SUGGESTIONS RELATED TO THE MICRO MACRO BEHAVIOUR OF BENTONITIC BUFFER MATERIALS SUBJECTED TO RESATURATION IN CONFINED NON ISOTHERMAL CONDITIONS ARE EXPLORED. SIMULATION OF PRE HEATING PHASES OF THE EXPERIMENT DEMONSTRATES THE ABILITY OF THE MODEL TO DESCRIBE THE HYDRAULIC REGIME IN THE HOST ROCK AND ISOTHERMAL INFILTRATION INTO THE BUFFER. CONSIDERATION OF THE HEATING PHASE CONFIRMS THAT THE TEMPERATURE FIELD IS WELL UNDERSTOOD, WITH A GOOD CORRELATION BETWEEN THE NUMERICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS. IN THE MOISTURE FIELD IT IS FOUND THAT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE EMPLACED BUFFER AND HOST ROCK IS OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE. IT IS FOUND THAT INCLUSION OF MICRO MACRO INTERACTION EFFECTS, BY WAY OF CONSIDERATION OF THE IMPACT OF SWELLING AND MICRO MACRO INTERACTIONS ON THE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY OF THE MATERIAL, YIELDED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED CORRELATIONS BETWEEN OBSERVED AND CALCULATED RESULTS IN THE MOISTURE FIELD. THE RESULTS OF THE NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS SUGGEST THAT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE EMPLACED BUFFER AND HOST ROCK IS STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THE MICRO MACRO BEHAVIOUR OF THE BENTONITIC BUFFER MATERIAL. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE CONSIDERATION OF THE IMPACT OF MICRO MACRO INTERACTIONS ON MOISTURE FLOW IN BENTONITIC BUFFERS IS OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE, AND MAY BE OF SOME SIGNIFICANCE IN CONSIDERING THE TOTAL RESATURATION TIME AS PART OF THE PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT OF A NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL REPOSITORY.  2009 THOMAS TELFORD LTD.

GEOSTATISTICAL PARAMETERS SUCH AS THE MEAN, THE STANDARD DEVIATION AND THE CORRELATION LENGTH ARE CHARACTERISTIC FOR EACH SEDIMENT AND FORMATION HISTORY. THE EFFECTS OF SPATIAL VARIABILITY ON THE DRAINED AND UNDRAINED SHEAR RESPONSE OF SOILS ARE INVESTIGATED USING NUMERICAL PARAMETRIC STUDIES WHERE MULTIPLE REALISATIONS ARE TESTED FOR SELECTED GEOSTATISTICAL PARAMETERS. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE MEAN UNDRAINED SHEAR STRENGTH DECREASES AS SPATIAL VARIABILITY AND CORRELATION LENGTH INCREASE. SPATIAL VARIABILITY PROMPTS STRAIN LOCALISATION ALONG NEIGHBOURING WEAK ZONES UNDER BOTH DRAINED AND UNDRAINED LOADING. HETEROGENEOUS CONTRACTIVE MEDIA SHOW INTERNAL HOMOGENISATION DURING DRAINED DEVIATORIC LOADING, AND THE DRAINED SHEAR RESISTANCE EVOLVES TOWARDS THE CRITICAL STATE; MEDIA WITH HIGHER VARIABILITY AND LONGER CORRELATION LENGTH REQUIRE HIGHER STRAIN TO ATTAIN INTERNAL HOMOGENISATION. ANISOTROPY IN SPATIAL CORRELATION CAUSES ANISOTROPY IN SHEAR STRENGTH. AN INTERMEDIATE DRAINAGE CONDITION EMERGES IN SPATIALLY VARYING MEDIA WHEREBY LOCAL DRAINAGE MAY DEVELOP DURING GLOBALLY UNDRAINED SHEAR; LOCAL DRAINAGE AFFECTS THE LOAD DEFORMATION RESPONSE.

THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A LIMIT EQUILIBRIUM SOLUTION FOR THE UPLIFT RESISTANCE OF PIPES AND PLATE ANCHORS BURIED IN SAND. THE GEOMETRY OF THIS SOLUTION REFLECTS OBSERVATIONS FROM MODEL TESTS. PEAK ANGLES OF FRICTION AND DILATION ARE FOUND USING ESTABLISHED CORRELATIONS THAT CAPTURE THE INFLUENCE OF STRESS LEVEL AND DENSITY. THESE ANGLES GOVERN THE GEOMETRY OF THE FAILURE MECHANISM AND THE MOBILISED RESISTANCE. THE SOLUTION IS VALIDATED USING A DATABASE OF 115 MODEL TESTS ON PIPES AND STRIP ANCHORS ASSEMBLED FROM THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE. GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE OVERALL DATABASE IS SHOWN, WITHOUT OPTIMISATION OF ANY INPUT PARAMETERS. THE METHOD OVERPREDICTS THE UPLIFT RESISTANCE OF SMOOTH MODEL PIPES BY 10%, HIGHLIGHTING THE INFLUENCE OF PIPE ROUGHNESS. IN CONTRAST, IT IS SHOWN THAT THE SOLUTION FOR UPLIFT RESISTANCE BASED ON THE LIMIT THEOREMS OF PLASTICITY IS GENERALLY UNCONSERVATIVE. THE ASSUMPTION OF NORMALITY, WHICH IS REQUIRED BY THE LIMIT THEOREMS, LEADS TO AN UNREALISTIC FAILURE MECHANISM INVOLVING UPLIFT OF A FAR WIDER ZONE OF SOIL THAN IS SEEN IN MODEL TESTS. PLASTICITY THEORY, WITH NORMALITY, IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR MODELLING THIS CLASS OF KINEMATICALLY RESTRAINED PROBLEM IN DRAINED CONDITIONS, AS NORMALITY IS NOT OBSERVED. AS FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS IS NOT ROUTINELY USED IN PRACTICE PARTLY OWING TO THE DIFFICULTY IN SELECTING APPROPRIATE INPUT PARAMETERS TO DESCRIBE DILATANCY AND PLASTIC FLOW THE SIMPLE ANALYTICAL IDEALISATION DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER PROVIDES A USEFUL TOOL FOR UPLIFT RESISTANCE PREDICTION. SIMPLE CHARTS FOR THE PREDICTION OF PEAK UPLIFT RESISTANCE FROM CRITICAL STATE FRICTION ANGLE, RELATIVE DENSITY AND NORMALISED BURIAL DEPTH ARE PRESENTED, TO AID THE DESIGN OF BURIED PIPES AND ANCHORS.

THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THIS BY DETAILING EXPERIMENTALLY OBSERVED BEARING FAILURE MODES INDUCED DURING THE PENETRATION OF A SPUDCAN THROUGH A LAYER OF SAND INTO UNDERLYING NORMALLY CONSOLIDATED CLAY. DIGITAL IMAGES WERE CAPTURED CONTINUOUSLY BY INSTALLING A HALF SPUDCAN AGAINST A TRANSPARENT WINDOW, AND ANALYSED USING A PARTICLE IMAGE VELOCIMETRY TECHNIQUE COUPLED WITH CLOSE RANGE PHOTOGRAMMETRY CORRECTION. AS THE EXPERIMENTS WERE PERFORMED IN A GEOTECHNICAL CENTRIFUGE THE OBSERVED MECHANISMS OCCURRED IN STRESS CONDITIONS OF SIMILAR MAGNITUDE TO THE OFFSHORE CASE. THE EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE PROVIDES: (A) FAILURE MODES AT DIFFERENT SPUDCAN PENETRATION DEPTHS; (B) THE TRANSITIONAL FAILURE MECHANISM AT THE EVENT OF PEAK BEARING RESISTANCE; AND (C) THE CHANGES IN OVERALL FAILURE MECHANISM DUE TO VARYING GEOMETRIC AND STRENGTH CONDITIONS OF THE LAYERED SOIL. THE RESULTS PROVIDE USEFUL REFERENCES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF ANALYTICAL OR NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS FOR THIS PROBLEM.

IT IS FOUND THAT AT SHALLOW EMBEDMENT THE BEARING CAPACITY FACTOR, N GAMMA, MOBILISED BY A CONICAL FOOTING IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER BY A FACTOR OF UP TO 2 THAN THAT FOR A FLAT FOOTING. PLASTICITY SOLUTIONS INDICATE THAT THIS DISCREPANCY CANNOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE THEORETICAL DIFFERENCES IN N GAMMA THAT ARISE FROM THE ROUGHNESS AND GEOMETRY OF THE CONE: THESE THEORETICAL DIFFERENCES ARE MINOR (&LT;10%). INSTEAD, IT IS PROPOSED THAT IN DENSE SAND THE PRE SHEARING INDUCED BY THE CONICAL SHAPE OF THE FOOTING LEADS TO A FORM OF PROGRESSIVE FAILURE, SO A LOWER OPERATIVE FRICTION ANGLE IS APPLICABLE TO CONICAL FOUNDATIONS THAN FOR FLAT FOOTINGS. SINCE ACCURATE SOLUTIONS FOR N GAMMA EXIST, THE KEY UNCERTAINTY IN THE PREDICTION OF BEARING CAPACITY IS THE APPROPRIATE FRICTION ANGLE, WHICH IS AFFECTED BY THIS PROGRESSIVE FAILURE MECHANISM. A BACKANALYSIS THAT INCORPORATES BOLTONS STRESS DILATANCY CORRELATIONS IN AN ITERATIVE CALCULATION FOR BEARING CAPACITY IS INTRODUCED, USING RECENTLY PUBLISHED DEFINITIVE VALUES OF N GAMMA. THIS FRAMEWORK IS CALIBRATED USING CENTRIFUGE MODEL TEST DATA. THE PROGRESSIVE FAILURE MECHANISM IS CAPTURED IN A SIMPLE FASHION BY VARYING BOLTONS M PARAMETER, WHICH CONTROLS THE DILATANT CONTRIBUTION TO PEAK STRENGTH. THIS BACK ANALYSIS IS USED TO CREATE SIMPLE CHARTS THAT ILLUSTRATE THE EFFECTS OF STRESS LEVEL, DENSITY AND PROGRESSIVE FAILURE ON THE OPERATIVE FRICTION ANGLE AND N GAMMA. THESE CHARTS ARE COMPARED WITH EXISTING GUIDANCE FOR SPUDCAN BEARING CAPACITY.

THE IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TUNNELLING AND GEOTECHNICS IS HIGH LIGHTED, AND RECENT ADVANCES IN RESEARCH AND PRACTICE ARE DESCRIBED, DRAWING ON MODEL STUDIES, THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND FIELD MEASUREMENTS FROM CASE HISTORIES FROM AROUND THE WORLD. SIMPLIFIED PLASTICITY MODELS ARE PRESENTED THAT CAN BE USED BY DESIGNERS TO ASSESS GROUND MOVEMENTS AND TUNNEL LINING LOADS IN COMPLEX GROUND CONDITIONS. THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF PILOT TUNNELS AND IN SITU MEASUREMENTS TO VALIDATE SUCH MODELS, DRAWING ON A CASE HISTORY FROM BOLU, TURKEY, AND ON OTHER TUNNELLING PROJECTS, IS DESCRIBED. RECENT TECHNICAL ADVANCES IN EARTH PRESSURE BALANCE TUNNELLING ARE CONSIDERED, ILLUSTRATED BY MEASUREMENTS FROM THE CHANNEL TUNNEL RAIL LINK PROJECT, WITH EMPHASIS ON KEY FACTORS INFLUENCING VOLUME LOSS, SUCH AS FACE PRESSURE, SOIL CONDITIONING AND EFFECTIVE SCREW CONVEYOR OPERATION. A RECENT CASE HISTORY IN BOLOGNA IS DESCRIBED, IN WHICH THE INNOVATIVE USE OF DIRECTIONAL DRILLING TO INSTALL CURVED GROUT TUBES WAS EMPLOYED FOR A COMPENSATION GROUTING PROJECT IN GRANULAR SOILS. TIME DEPENDENT GROUND MOVEMENTS AND TUNNEL LINING DISTORTIONS OCCURRING AFTER TUNNELLING ARE DISCUSSED, THEIR MAGNITUDE DEPENDING ON THE RELATIVE PERMEABILITY OF THE TUNNEL LINING AND SOIL, THE DEGREE OF ANISOTROPY OF THE SOIL PERMEABILITY, AND THE INITIAL PORE PRESSURE PRIOR TO TUNNELLING. THE EFFECTS OF TUNNELLING INDUCED SETTLEMENTS ON PIPELINES ARE CONSIDERED, DRAWING ON CENTRIFUGE TESTS AND ANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS, AND A NEW DESIGN APPROACH IS PRESENTED, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE REDUCTION OF SOIL STIFFNESS WITH INCREASING SHEAR STRAIN AS A RESULT OF TUNNEL VOLUME LOSS. THE LECTURE CONCLUDES WITH A DESCRIPTION OF A DISTRIBUTED STRAIN SENSING TECHNIQUE USING FIBRE OPTIC TECHNOLOGY, BASED ON BRILLOUIN OPTICAL TIME DOMAIN REFLECTOMETRY (BOTDR), AND ITS INNOVATIVE APPLICATION TO FIELD MONITORING OF A MASONRY TUNNEL SUBJECTED TO NEW TUNNEL CONSTRUCTION BENEATH IT.

IN THIS PAPER THE MODEL UNCERTAINTY OR MODEL BIAS, CHARACTERISED BY APPLYING BAYESIAN MAPPING AND RELIABILITY TECHNIQUES, AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF DAMAGE POTENTIAL (PROBABILITY) ARE ANALYSED. THE CONCEPT OF APPARENT MODEL BIAS FACTOR IS INTRODUCED, AND AN ITERATIVE PROCEDURE IS DEVELOPED TO TACKLE THE ISSUE OF PRIOR PROBABILITY IN THE CALIBRATION OF APPARENT MODEL BIAS FACTOR. SATISFACTORY RESULTS ARE OBTAINED WITH THE DEVELOPED ITERATIVE PROCEDURE FOR ESTIMATING THE PROBABILITY OF DAMAGE OF BUILDINGS CAUSED BY EXCAVATION.

DIRECT CALIBRATION AT SUCH HIGH SUCTIONS REQUIRES THE IMPOSITION OF NEGATIVE WATER PRESSURES, WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE USING FACILITIES COMMONLY AVAILABLE IN SOIL MECHANICS LABORATORIES. FOR THIS REASON, TENSIOMETERS ARE USUALLY CALIBRATED IN THE POSITIVE PRESSURE RANGE, AND SUCH CALIBRATION IS SUBSEQUENTLY EXTRA POLATED TO NEGATIVE PRESSURES. THIS PAPER EXAMINES DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES TO ASSESS THE ACCURACY OF SUCH EXTRAPOLATION. ANY ERROR IN THE CALIBRATION PROCESS WOULD BE DIRECTLY REFLECTED IN THE MEASURED VALUES OF SUCTION, AND MIGHT BE PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT (IN RELATIVE TERMS) FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF LOW SUCTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SHOW THAT CALIBRATION IN THE POSITIVE RANGE IS AFFECTED BOTH BY THE PHYSICAL CONFIGURATION OF THE TENSIOMETER DURING CALIBRATION AND BY ASPECTS OF ITS DESIGN. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT LINEAR EXTRAPOLATION OF THE CALIBRATION FROM THE POSITIVE TO THE NEGATIVE RANGE IS SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE PROVIDED THAT CALIBRATION IS DONE UNDER CONDITIONS THAT CLOSELY MATCH THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE TENSIOMETER WILL BE USED. OWING TO STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TENSIOMETERS, AND ALSO TO SUCTION INDUCED CALIBRATION HYSTERESIS, AT LEAST ONE CHECK ON THE ACCURACY OF THE EXTRAPOLATED CALIBRATION EQUATION OVER A RANGE OF NEGATIVE PRESSURE SHOULD BE PERFORMED, EVEN IF AT LOW VALUES OF SUCTION.

THE EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED THROUGH CYCLIC AND MONOTONIE UNDRAINED/ CONSTANT VOLUME SIMPLE SHEAR TESTS CARRIED OUT ON RECONSTITUTED SPECIMENS PREPARED BY USING THE SEDIMENTATION IN WATER (WS) METHOD. TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT ON SPECIMENS RECONSTITUTED AT TWO VOID RATIOS (I.E. LOOSE AND DENSE) AND DIFFERENT EFFECTIVE CONSOLIDATION STRESSES. FURTHERMORE, TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EFFECT OF NON ZERO MEAN SHEAR STRESS LEVEL, CYCLIC SIMPLE SHEAR TESTS WERE PERFORMED UNDER BOTH SYMMETRICAL AND NON SYMMETRICAL CYCLIC LOADING. TWO TYPES OF FAILURE MODES HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN CYCLIC TESTS, THAT IS CYCLIC LIQUEFACTION OR CYCLIC MOBILITY, DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE CONDUCTED UNDER SHEAR STRESS REVERSAL CONDITIONS. A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK SEEMS TO EXIST WHEREBY UNDRAINED MONOTONIC AND CYCLIC RESPONSE CAN BE COMPARATIVELY ANALYSED. IN PARTICULAR, NORMALISING THE CYCLIC LIQUEFACTION RESISTANCES OBTAINED FROM SYMMETRICAL TESTS BY PHASE TRANSFORMATION STRENGTHS DETERMINED IN CORRESPONDING MONOTONIE TESTS, PROVIDES A CYCLIC LIQUEFACTION RESISTANCE CURVE WHICH WAS FOUND TO BE UNIQUE, IRRESPECTIVE OF INITIAL VOID RATIO AND VERTICAL EFFECTIVE STRESS. UNDRAINED CYCLIC SHEAR STRENGTH OF THE TESTED SAND APPEARS TO BE AFFECTED BY THE PRESENCE OF A NON ZERO MEAN SHEAR STRESS, FOLLOWING A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOUR, WHICH IS SIMILAR FOR BOTH LOOSE AND DENSE SPECIMENS. FURTHERMORE, THE NORMALISED STRESS STRAIN CURVES OF THE CYCLIC TESTS SHOW BACK BONE CURVES THAT ARE PRACTICALLY COINCIDENT WITH THE EQUIVALENT MONOTONIC CURVES.

A CUSTOM MADE ONE DIMENSIONAL COMPRESSION CELL WITH FLUID FLOW CAPABILITIES WAS USED TO LOAD AND FLUSH SATURATED SPECIMENS COMPOSED OF SELECTED SANDS WITH HETEROGENEOUS MINERAL COMPOSITION. THE DEGREE OF INTERNAL STABILITY (I.E. THE EXTENT TO WHICH A SOIL CAN RETAIN ITS MOBILE PARTICLES) WAS QUANTIFIED WITH BOTH THE SIZE DISTRIBUTION CURVES AND THE RELATIVE AMOUNTS OF FRAGMENTS COLLECTED IN THE EFFLUENT. RESULTS INDICATE THAT: (A) UNIFORM INTERNALLY STABLE SANDS BECOME INTERNALLY UNSTABLE AT HIGH STRESSES, ALBEIT TEMPORARILY; AND (A) INTERNAL INSTABILITY FEATURES ARE DEPENDENT ON MINERAL COMPOSITION AND THE EXTENT OF PARTICLE BREAKAGE. PARTICLE LEVEL FORCE ANALYSES SUGGEST THAT THE INTERNAL STABILITY OF CRUSHED SANDS IS DEPENDENT ON THE HYDRODYNAMIC CONDITIONS IMPOSED.

THE FORMULATION ENTAILS THREE MAIN STAGES: (A) ASSUMPTION OF ADMISSIBLE PATTERN FUNCTIONS FROM WHICH DISPLACEMENT FIELDS CAN BE ASSEMBLED; (B) EQUATING EXTERNAL WORK TO INTERNAL WORK; AND (C) MINIMISATION OF INTERNAL WORK BY VARIATION OF THE DISPLACEMENT FIELD USING THE DIFFERENT PATTERN FUNCTIONS. THE APPROACH IS DEMONSTRATED ON TWO PROBLEMS: (A) A VERTICALLY LOADED SHALLOW FOUNDATION; AND (B) LATERALLY LOADED PILES. THE APPROACH IS EVALUATED BY COMPARISON WITH FINITE DIFFERENCE ANALYSES USING THREE DIFFERENT CONSTITUTIVE MODELS. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE APPROACH PROVIDES A FAIR ESTIMATION OF THE OVERALL FOUNDATION RESPONSE. UNDER LARGE DISPLACEMENTS THE METHOD DEGENERATES INTO CONVENTIONAL UPPER BOUND CALCULATIONS.

FOCUSED ON THE BENCHMARK SMALL STRAIN REGIME AND GMAX CONDITION, MULTIPLE SMALL AMPLITUDE VIBRATION TESTS ON A RIGID SQUARE PLATE RESTING ON A UNIFORM DRY SAND WERE CONDUCTED ON A LARGE GEOTECHNICAL CENTRIFUGE. A SET OF BASIC EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON THE VERTICAL AND ROCKING DYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SOIL PLATE SYSTEM WERE GENERATED BY MEANS OF A NEW ECCENTRIC TEST FORMAT, AS WELL AS BY CONVENTIONAL SYMMETRICAL VERTICAL VIBRATION. THROUGH A COMPARISON OF THE MEASURED DATA WITH CANONICAL CONTINUUM SOLUTIONS OF A HALF SPACE WITH CONSTANT AS WELL AS COMMON DEPTH DEPENDENT SHEAR MODULUS PROFILES, SOME FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES IN REGARD TO THE RELEVANCE OF SUCH COMMONLY ACCEPTED IDEALISATIONS OF THE INTENDED PRACTICAL APPLICATION WERE REVEALED. AS AN EXPERIMENTAL WAY TO CONFIRM AND CIRCUMVENT A KEY ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM, THE NOVEL TEST STRATEGY OF USING A LIGHTWEIGHT FOUNDATION IN AN EMBEDDED CONFIGURATION WAS PROPOSED AND EVALUATED.

AN ENGINEERED FILL, WHICH HAS BEEN HEAVILY COMPACTED IN THIN LAYERS UNDER CLOSELY CONTROLLED CONDITIONS, SHOULD BE A RELATIVELY UNIFORM MATERIAL AND HAVE BEHAVIOUR THAT IS EASILY PREDICTED ON THE BASIS OF AVERAGE PROPERTIES. IN CONTRAST, POORLY COMPACTED FILL DUMPED WITH LITTLE CONTROL IN DEEP LIFTS IS LIKELY TO BE IN A LOOSE STATE AND EXHIBIT GREAT DIVERSITY IN ITS GEOTECHNICAL PROPERTIES: THE BEHAVIOUR OF SUCH HETEROGENEOUS FILL WILL BEAR LITTLE RELATION TO AVERAGE PROPERTIES, AND WILL BE CONTROLLED LARGELY BY ZONES OF FILL IN A METASTABLE STATE WITH UNPREDICTABLE BEHAVIOUR. CASE HISTORIES THAT INCLUDE FIELD MEASUREMENTS THAT IS, QUANTITATIVE DATA ARE OF PARTICULAR VALUE IN GAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PERFORMANCE OF FILL MATERIALS. CASE HISTORIES OF FILL BEHAVIOUR ARE EXAMINED IN FOUR AREAS OF PRACTICAL INTEREST TO THE GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEER: (A) THE GEOTECHNICAL BEHAVIOUR OF OPENCAST MINING BACKFILLS; (B) THE PERFORMANCE OF ROCKFILL DAMS; (C) THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GROUND TREATMENT; AND (D) THE CONDITION ASSESSMENT OF EMBANKMENT DAMS. IN EACH OF THESE AREAS THE LECTURE FOCUSES ON THE RESULTS OF LONG TERM FIELD MONITORING AT A NUMBER OF SITES, FROM WHICH SOME GENERAL CONCLUSIONS ARE DRAWN. DISCERNMENT IS REQUIRED IN THE STUDY OF CASE HISTORIES, BUT DESPITE SHORTCOMINGS, THEY PROVIDE A MUCH NEEDED COUNTERWEIGHT TO EXCESSIVE THEORISATION.

FIELD METHODS SUCH AS THE CONE PENETRATION TEST (CPT) CAN BE USED AS LESS EXPENSIVE AND FASTER ALTERNATIVES TO SAMPLE RETRIEVAL AND TESTING. UNFORTUNATELY, CURRENT SOIL CLASSIFICATION CHARTS BASED ON CPT DATA AND LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS ARE TOO GENERIC, AND MAY NOT PROVIDE AN ACCURATE PREDICTION OF THE SOIL TYPE. A PROBABILISTIC APPROACH IS PROPOSED HERE TO UPDATE AND MODIFY SOIL IDENTIFICATION CHARTS BASED ON SITE SPECIFIC CPT DATA. THE PROBABILITY THAT A SOIL IS CORRECTLY CLASSIFIED IS ALSO ESTIMATED. THE UPDATED IDENTIFICATION CHART CAN BE USED FOR A MORE ACCURATE PREDICTION OF THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE SOIL, AND CAN ACCOUNT FOR PRIOR INFORMATION AVAILABLE BEFORE CONDUCTING THE TESTS, SITE SPECIFIC DATA, AND MEASUREMENT ERRORS. AS AN ILLUSTRATION, THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS IMPLEMENTED USING CPT DATA FROM THE TREPORTI TEST SITE (TTS) NEAR VENICE (ITALY) AND THE NATIONAL GEOTECHNICAL EXPERIMENTATION SITES (NGES) AT TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY. THE APPLICABILITY OF THE SITE SPECIFIC CHART FOR OTHER SITES IN VENICE LAGOON IS ASSESSED USING DATA FROM THE MALAMOCCO TEST SITE, APPROXIMATELY 20 KM FROM TTS.

A FRAGMENTATION RATIO IS DEFINED TO DESCRIBE THE BOND BREAKAGE PROCESSES, AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OTHER MICRO MECHANICAL PARAMETERS SUCH AS SLIDING CONTACTS RATIO, AVERAGE COORDINATION NUMBER, DEVIATOR FABRIC, AND INTERNAL ENERGIES PER UNIT VOLUME IS DISCUSSED. THREE DIFFERENT MODES OF GRAIN DAMAGE WERE OBSERVED: ASPERITY BREAKAGE, INTERNAL SHEAR CRACKING, AND INTERNAL TENSILE CRACKING LEADING TO FAST FRACTURE. ENERGY BALANCES BOTH FOR THE COMPRESSION OF A SINGLE GRAIN, AND FOR TRIAXIAL TESTS ON ASSEMBLIES OF GRAINS, SHOWED THAT THE LOSS OF ELASTIC ENERGY DUE TO BOND BREAKAGE WAS A NEGLIGIBLE FRACTION OF THE SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED DISSIPATION ENCOUNTERED WITH CRUSHABLE MATERIALS. THIS EXTRA DISSIPATION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH FRICTIONAL SLIDING TRIGGERED BY THE CREATION OF NEW DEGREES OF FREEDOM AMONG THE BREAKING FRAGMENTS. DIFFERENT MODES OF GRAIN BREAKAGE WERE FOUND TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF DIFFERENT REGIONS OF SOIL STATES OF STRESS DEFINED WITH RESPECT TO THE VIRGIN COMPRESSION LINE. THE SECONDARY ROLE OF ELASTIC GRAIN DEFORMABILITY, INCREASING COORDINATION NUMBER BUT REDUCING DILATANCY, HAS ALSO BEEN DEMONSTRATED.

THIS PAPER USES FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS AS AN INDEPENDENT TOOL TO VALIDATE THE NEW PROCEDURE FOR BOTH HOMOGENEOUS AND NON HOMOGENEOUS SLOPES. GOOD AGREEMENT IS FOUND BETWEEN THE NEW PROCEDURE AND FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS, IN TERMS OF THE CRITICAL ACCELERATION, THE CRITICAL SLIP SURFACE AND NORMAL AND SHEAR STRESS DISTRIBUTION ON THE SLIP SURFACE, IN BOTH HOMOGENEOUS SLOPES AND NON HOMOGENEOUS SLOPES. HOWEVER, WHEN NON ASSOCIATED FLOW RULES ARE ADOPTED IN FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS AND THE CORRESPONDING DEGREE OF NON NORMALITY IS HIGH, SOME DIFFERENCES ARE NOTICED. THE REASON FOR THIS DIFFERENCE IS EXPLAINED.

PREDICTION AND CONTROL OF THIS PHENOMENON ARE REQUIRED FOR THE SAFE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF THESE PIPELINES. HOWEVER, THE SOIL RESPONSE UNDER COMBINED VERTICAL AND LATERAL LOADING IS A SIGNIFICANT AREA OF UNCERTAINTY, AND CURRENT PRACTICE RELIES ON EMPIRICAL EXPRESSIONS FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LATERAL PIPE SOIL RESISTANCE. THIS PAPER REPORTS THE RESULTS OF FINITE ELEMENT (FE) ANALYSES OF SHALLOWLY EMBEDDED PIPELINES UNDER VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL LOAD. THESE ANALYSES HAVE BEEN COMPARED WITH COLLAPSE LOADS CALCULATED USING THE UPPERBOUND THEOREM OF PLASTICITY, AND ARE USED TO CONSTRUCT YIELD ENVELOPES DEFINING THE LIMITING COMBINATIONS OF VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL LOAD. THE FE LIMITING LOADS WERE FOUND TO COMPARE WELL WITH UPPER BOUND PLASTICITY SOLUTIONS, AND THE INTERNAL SOIL DISPLACEMENTS CALCULATED IN THE FE ANALYSES MATCH THE UPPER BOUND AND EXPERIMENTALLY OBSERVED DEFORMATION PATTERNS. THE YIELD ENVELOPES GENERATED BY THE FE AND UPPER BOUND ANALYSES HAVE BEEN FITTED BY SIMPLE SOLUTIONS, WHICH AID ASSESSMENT OF THE ULTIMATE RESISTANCE OF SHALLOWLY EMBEDDED PIPELINES.

THE MEAN GCL HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY WITH RESPECT TO WATER IS SHOWN TO BE 3 3 TIMES; 10 11 M/S BEFORE FREEZE THAW. THE MEAN HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITIES AFTER UP TO 100 FREEZE THAW CYCLES DID NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY, AND WERE IN THE RANGE 2 2 5 3 X 10 11 M/S. FREEZE THAW CYCLES DID REDUCE THE ENTRY PRESSURE REQUIRED FOR JET A 1 TO BEGIN TO PERMEATE THROUGH THE GCL FROM ABOUT 27 TO 55 KPA WITH NO FREEZE THAW CYCLES TO 13 8 20 7 KPA FOR 3 TO 50 FREEZE THAW CYCLES, AND TO 0 13 8 KPA AFTER 100 FREEZE THAW CYCLES. FOR THE GCL SPECIMENS SUBJECTED TO 5, 12 AND 50 FREEZE THAW CYCLES IN THE LABORATORY, THE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY WITH RESPECT TO JET A 1 IS LESS THAN 3 X 10 11 M/S AT A PRESSURE JUST ABOVE THE ENTRY PRESSURE, COMPARED WITH LESS THAN 3 X 10 12 M/S FOR GCL SAMPLES RECOVERED FROM THE FIELD. THE COMBINED EFFECT OF MANY FREEZE THAW CYCLES AND PERMEATION WITH JET A 1 DID RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; HOWEVER, THE EFFECT WAS SMALL, AND THE GCL PERFORMED WELL WITH A MAXIMUM HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY OF 1 X 10 101 M/S AFTER 100 FREEZE THAW CYCLES.

THE PROPERTIES OF THE FIBRE REINFORCED SAND ARE ANISOTROPIC BECAUSE OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF ORIENTATION OF THE FIBRES, WHICH IS CHARACTERISED BY A PREFERRED BEDDING PLANE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ANISOTROPIC YIELD CONDITION FOR FIBREREINFORCED SAND IS PRESENTED. APPLICATION OF THE KINEMATIC APPROACH OF LIMIT ANALYSIS TO ANISOTROPIC FRICTIONAL MATERIALS IS DEMONSTRATED. AN INTERESTING IMPLICATION OF ANISOTROPY IS A LACK OF UNIQUENESS IN THE INTERNAL FRICTION ANGLE ALONG A SHEAR SURFACE WITH GIVEN ORIENTATION. THE ANISOTROPIC INTERNAL FRICTION ANGLE WAS FOUND TO BE A FUNCTION OF THE MAJOR PRINCIPAL STRAIN RATE DIRECTION, AND NOT JUST A FUNCTION OF THE ORIENTATION OF THE SHEAR SURFACE. WHILE THE INCLINATION OF PRINCIPAL STRAIN RATE DIRECTIONS CAN BE INFERRED FROM THE KINEMATICS OF THE MECHANISM FOR A GIVEN BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEM, THE INTERNAL FRICTION ANGLE CANNOT BE DETERMINED A PRIORI AS A UNIQUE FUNCTION OF ORIENTATION IN SPACE. TWO EXAMPLES ARE PRESENTED TO ILLUSTRATE THE USE OF THE KINEMATIC APPROACH FOR ANISOTROPIC FRICTIONAL MATERIALS: RETAINING WALL LOADING, AND THE BEARING CAPACITY OF A FOOTING.

OUR OBJECTIVE IN THIS OVERVIEW IS TO HIGHLIGHT THE KEY PAPERS AND CONCEPTS IN MINERALOGY, POLLUTION AND THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN GEOTECHNIQUE OVER THE LAST 60 YEARS, AND TO CONSIDER THE FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR PROGRESS IN THESE AREAS OF GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING. TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR OUR REVIEW WE HAVE ADOPTED THE CONCEPT OF COUPLED PHENOMENA, AND WE HAVE CONSIDERED SIX PROCESSES (MECHANICAL, HYDROLOGICAL, CHEMICAL, ELECTRICAL, THERMAL AND BIOLOGICAL). BY REVIEWING THE MAJOR TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE AREAS OF CHEMICAL, ELECTRICAL, THERMAL AND BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON SOIL SYSTEMS, THE IMPORTANCE OF A SOUND UNDERSTANDING OF THESE PHENOMENA IN GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING IS HIGHLIGHTED. WE CONCLUDE THAT, ALTHOUGH MUCH EXCELLENT WORK HAS BEEN PUBLISHED IN GEOTECHNIQUE, THERE ARE STILL MANY OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES OFFERED BY SOIL PROCESSES, AND ESPECIALLY LOW INTENSITY CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES.

THE REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS THE SHIFTING TIDES OF FASHION TO AND FRO, FROM LABORATORY TO FIELD TESTS, BUT EMPHASISES THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE TWO. WHILE THE EARLY YEARS OF GEOTECHNIQUE WITNESSED THE MORE OBVIOUSLY DRAMATIC DEVELOPMENTS, MORE RECENT YEARS HAVE SEEN REFINEMENTS IN APPARATUS AND TECHNIQUES, PARTICULARLY FOR SMALL STRAINS, AND ALSO ANALYSES, IN WHICH THE EFFECTS OF MORE COMPLEX ASPECTS OF SOIL BEHAVIOUR HAVE BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR, SUCH AS STRUCTURE, STRESS AND STRAIN HISTORY, AND TIME RELATED EFFECTS. ALTHOUGH MORE SUBTLE IN NATURE, THESE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE STILL HAD IMMENSE INFLUENCE ON ENGINEERING PRACTICE.

THE WORK AND INSPIRATION OF THE PIONEERS WHOSE EFFORTS CREATED AND NURSED THE JOURNAL THROUGH ITS EARLY YEARS ARE ILLUSTRATED BY REFERENCE TO BOTH PUBLISHED AND PRIVATE RECOLLECTIONS. THE ROLE OF THE GEOTECHNICAL SOCIETY, BOTH IN THE FOUNDATION OF GEOTECHNIQUE AND IN LINKING THE MEMBERS OF ITS ADVISORY PANEL, IS DESCRIBED WITH REFERENCE TO SOME OF ITS TRADITIONS. THE EXPANSION OF GEOTECHNIQUE AND ITS EVOLUTION TO BECOME AND REMAIN THE LEADING INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL IN ITS FIELD ARE DISCUSSED, BASED ON A STUDY OF THE ADVISORY PANELS MINUTES AND RECOLLECTIONS OF PAST CHAIRMEN. INTERACTIONS WITH THE BRITISH GEOTECHNICAL ASSOCIATION (FORMERLY SOCIETY), THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS AND THE PUBLISHERS, THOMAS TELFORD LTD, ARE RECORDED. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF AWARDS AND PRIZES THAT HAVE BEEN ATTRACTED BY GEOTECHNIQUE PAPERS OVER THE YEARS.

GEOTECHNIQUE PAPERS PUBLISHED OVER THE PAST 60 YEARS THAT HAVE DEALT WITH THIS SUBJECT ARE SUMMARISED AND DISCUSSED HERE. THE PAPERS HAVE BEEN ORGANISED ACCORDING TO THEIR SUBJECT MATTER, INCLUDING HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES, VARIOUS FORMS OF THEORETICAL AND NUMERICAL ANALYSES, SMALL SCALE MODELLING, AND FULL SCALE FIELD MONITORING. THE NUMBER OF PAPERS WRITTEN HAS STEADILY ACCELERATED WITH TIME, THUS INDICATING THE GROWING INTEREST IN TUNNELLING AND ITS EFFECTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT, AND AN INCREASE IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBJECT. HOWEVER, OUR KNOWLEDGE IS FAR FROM COMPLETE, AND THERE ARE STILL MANY CHALLENGES TO BE TACKLED, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING THE EFFECTS OF TUNNELLING ON EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE.

IN TERMS OF CONSTITUTIVE AND NUMERICAL MODELLING OF SOIL, EARLY FORMS OF NUMERICAL ANALYSIS INVOLVED HAND CALCULATIONS OF ULTIMATE STATES APPLYING CLASSICAL METHODS OF ANALYSIS: LIMIT EQUILIBRIUM, LIMIT ANALYSIS OR STRESS FIELD SOLUTIONS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE SOIL WAS CONSIDERED TO BEHAVE AS A RIGID PLASTIC MATERIAL, AND TO FOLLOW ONE OF THE TWO BASIC FAILURE LAWS OF CLASSICAL SOIL MECHANICS, NAMELY THE TRESCA OR MOHR COULOMB FAILURE CRITERIA. FOR ASSESSING THE DEFORMATION OF STRUCTURES, SOIL WAS NORMALLY CONSIDERED TO BE LINEAR ELASTIC. THE FOUNDATIONS OF MODERN NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND CONSTITUTIVE MODELLING WERE LAID IN THE EARLY TO MID 1960S, WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD AND THE POSTULATION OF THE CRITICAL STATE FRAMEWORK OF SOIL BEHAVIOUR RESPECTIVELY. CLEARLY, THE CONTINUOUS ADVANCEMENT OF COMPUTER POWER HAS BEEN ESSENTIAL IN APPLYING NEW DEVELOPMENTS TO MODERN GEOTECHNICAL ANALYSIS. THIS PAPER REVIEWS SOME OF THE MAIN MILESTONES IN THE EVOLUTION OF GEOTECHNICAL ANALYSIS IN THE PAST 60 YEARS, COMMENTING, WHERE APPROPRIATE, ON WHAT PROBLEMS STILL LIE AHEAD.

THEY HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DO THIS BY TALKING TO COLLEAGUES, BY DREAMING A LITTLE, BUT MAINLY BY TRYING TO EXTRAPOLATE THE TRENDS THEY SEE IN SOCIETY AND IN PRESENT DAY GEOTECHNICAL ACTIVITY. ALTHOUGH THE PRINCIPAL EMPHASIS OF GEOTECHNIQUE TENDS TO BE RESEARCH, THIS IS DRIVEN BY THE REQUIREMENTS OF DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION. HENCE, IN LOOKING TO THE FUTURE, EVEN THE FUTURE OF RESEARCH, LIKELY TRENDS IN GEOTECHNICAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE CONSIDERED FIRST, PARTICULARLY NOTING THE EMERGING IMPORTANCE OF ENERGY CONSERVATION AND CARBON DIOXIDE REDUCTION. THIS LEADS TO DISCUSSION OF THE CHARACTERISATION OF MATERIAL BEHAVIOUR AND INVESTIGATION OF THE GROUND, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF DESIGN PROCESSES. THE FUTURE OF DISSEMINATION OF GEOTECHNICAL INFORMATION IS ALSO DISCUSSED.

THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO HIGHLIGHT INFLUENTIAL PAPERS PUBLISHED IN GEOTECHNIQUE SINCE 1947, AND URGES THE READER TO SEEK THESE OUT. DESCRIPTIONS ARE GIVEN OF THOSE PAPERS CONSIDERED TO BE MOST INFLUENTIAL, RANGING FROM THE DENSIFICATION OF SOILS AT CAPE KENNEDY IN THE USA TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF A 41 M HIGH REINFORCED SOIL WALL IN SOUTH AFRICA. THE USE OF VIBRO COMPACTION AND VIBRO REPLACEMENT TECHNIQUES HAS FEATURED SIGNIFICANTLY, AS HAS CONSOLIDATION USING VERTICAL DRAINS. THE IMPORTANCE OF OBSERVATIONAL TECHNIQUES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO GROUND IMPROVEMENT HAS ALSO RECEIVED GREAT ATTENTION IN GEOTECHNIQUE. A SUMMARY OF PAPERS IS ALSO PRESENTED IN A TABLE TO PROVIDE A QUICK REFERENCE TOOL.

PUBLICATION FOLLOWED THE WIDE CIRCULATION OF A LETTER IN JULY 1947 FROM THE GEOTECHNICAL SOCIETY TO EVERY WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRY IN WHICH THE PROPOSAL FOR SUCH A PUBLICATION WAS MADE. LISTED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LETTER WERE ELEVEN FOUNDERS, FOUR FROM THE UK AND THE REMAINDER FROM ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE. THE FUNCTION OF THE FOUNDERS WAS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE EARLY ISSUES OF THE JOURNAL AND TO ASSIST WITH IDENTIFYING OTHER CONTRIBUTORS. THIS PAPER GIVES BRIEF VIGNETTES OF ALL THESE 11 EMINENT GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERS, TOGETHER WITH TWO OTHERS WHO CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE EARLY SUCCESS OF THE JOURNAL. IT IS HOPED THAT THESE VIGNETTES WILL SERVE TO INSPIRE PRESENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS OF GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERS, NOT ONLY IN THEIR PROFESSIONS, BUT ALSO IN THEIR ENJOYMENT OF WORKING WITH FELLOW ENTHUSIASTS.

IN THE FIRST 60 YEARS OF GEOTECHNIQUE, SOME 110 PUBLICATIONS HAVE APPEARED THAT RELATED TO SUCH STRUCTURES. THESE ARE DISCUSSED IN THIS REVIEW UNDER FIVE HEADINGS: CASE HISTORIES AND FULL SCALE OBSERVATIONS; GROUND MOVEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH RETAINING STRUCTURES; NUMERICAL ANALYSES; COMPACTION STRESSES ACTING ON STRUCTURES; AND SYMPOSIA IN PRINT. INDIVIDUAL COMMENTS ARE MADE ON APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE PAPERS PUBLISHED, HIGHLIGHTING KEY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE UNDERSTANDING OF RETAINING STRUCTURES. MANY OF THE PAPERS HAVE PROVIDED IMPORTANT INFORMATION SUBSEQUENTLY INCORPORATED INTO STANDARD REFERENCE DOCUMENTS FOR GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERS, NOTABLY THREE REPORTS PUBLISHED BY THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND INFORMATION ASSOCIATION (CIRIA): TEMPORARY PROPPING OF DEEP EXCAVATIONS: GUIDANCE ON DESIGN; THE OBSERVATIONAL METHOD IN GROUND ENGINEERING: PRINCIPLES AND APPLICATIONS; AND EMBEDDED RETAINING WALLS: GUIDANCE FOR ECONOMIC DESIGN. IN THIS WAY, AND THROUGH THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF INDIVIDUAL PAPERS TO OTHER ASPECTS OF PERFORMANCE, GEOTECHNIQUE HAS MADE A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE IMPROVED ANALYSIS, ENGINEERING DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND MONITORING OF RETAINING STRUCTURES.

FOCUSING ON EXPERIMENTAL WORK, THIS ESSAY ILLUSTRATES THE DEVELOPING UNDERSTANDING OF SOIL MECHANICS THROUGH BRIEF REVIEWS OF 47 CONTRIBUTIONS. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS WERE CHOSEN FOR THEIR INSIGHT OR INFLUENCE, NECESSARILY INVOLVING SUBJECTIVE JUDGEMENT ON OUR PART. SOME WORK COMPRISES NOW WELL UNDERSTOOD WISDOM. OTHER WORK PROVIDES FUNDAMENTAL, BUT NOT NECESSARILY WIDELY APPRECIATED, INSIGHT AND CONTINUES TO BE RELEVANT TO DEVELOPMENTS IN GEOMECHANICS TODAY. MOST INTERESTINGLY, A STRIKING FEATURE IN THESE VARIOUS CONTRIBUTIONS IS THE COMMONALITY IN FINDINGS ACROSS THE MANY SOILS AND LOADING PATHS INVESTIGATED. FROM A PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE, THIS BODY OF WORK ALLOWS ASSESSMENT OF SOIL BEHAVIOUR, UNDER A WIDE RANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES, USING SURPRISINGLY FEW TESTS. MORE GENERALLY, THESE CITED CONTRIBUTIONS PROVIDE A HISTORY OF THE SUBJECT AND SUGGEST WHERE THE SUBJECT MAY GO OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES.

THIS PAPER BRIEFLY REVIEWS SOME OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND RELATED ARTICLES, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO SHALLOW AND DEEP FOUNDATIONS. IN THE EARLY DAYS OF GEOTECHNIQUE, THE POWER TO PERFORM SOPHISTICATED NUMERICAL ANALYSES DID NOT EXIST. PAPERS TENDED TO FOCUS ON THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS USING SIMPLE MODELS IN WHICH SOIL WAS MODELLED EITHER AS LINEAR ELASTIC OR AS PERFECTLY PLASTIC. ENGINEERS SOUGHT SIMPLE CLOSED FORM ANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS FOR BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS. WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE POWERFUL ANALYTICAL, COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL CAPABILITIES, AND OF MORE SOPHISTICATED PILE INSTALLATION TECHNOLOGY (ESPECIALLY OFFSHORE), MORE RECENT PAPERS HAVE EXPLORED MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED APPROACHES TO A RANGE OF FOUNDATION PROBLEMS, STRIVING TO ACHIEVE MORE REALISTIC REPRESENTATION OF WORKING CONDITIONS. GEOTECHNIQUE PAPERS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS FACED BY THE FOUNDATION ENGINEERING INDUSTRY, WITH A STRONG EMPHASIS ON THE UNDERLYING SCIENCE; AS A RESULT, THESE PAPERS HAVE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF BOTH THE SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS IN OUR DISCIPLINE.

LAFAYETTE, UNITED STATES	LOUKIDIS, D., SCHOOL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, PURDUE UNIVERSITY, W. LAFAYETTE, UNITED STATES; SALGADO, R.	THE PAPER EXAMINES, USING NUMERICAL MODELLING, THE PROBLEM OF THE LIMIT SHAFT RESISTANCE OF NON DISPLACEMENT PILES INSTALLED IN SANDS. THE MODELLING MAKES USE OF AN ADVANCED, TWO SURFACE PLASTICITY CONSTITUTIVE MODEL. THE CONSTITUTIVE MODEL PREDICTS THE SOIL RESPONSE IN BOTH THE SMALL AND THE LARGE STRAIN RANGE, WHILE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE EFFECTS OF THE INTERMEDIATE PRINCIPAL EFFECTIVE STRESS AND OF THE INHERENT ANISOTROPY OF THE SAND. FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSES OF SHEARING ALONG THE PILE SHAFT ARE PERFORMED IN ORDER TO EXAMINE THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIMIT UNIT SHAFT RESISTANCE AND THE CHANGES IN STRESS STATE AROUND THE SHAFT UPON AXIAL LOADING OF THE PILE. SPECIAL FOCUS IS PLACED ON THE OPERATIVE VALUE OF THE LATERAL EARTH PRESSURE COEFFICIENT WHEN LIMIT SHAFT RESISTANCE IS REACHED. THE ANALYSES OFFER USEFUL INSIGHTS REGARDING THE FACTORS CONTROLLING THE VALUE OF UNIT SHAFT RESISTANCE IN SANDS. THE SIMULATIONS PREDICT A SIGNIFICANT BUILD UP OF HORIZONTAL EFFECTIVE STRESS FOR DENSE SANDS. BASED ON THESE SIMULATIONS, WE PROPOSE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LATERAL EARTH PRESSURE COEFFICIENT FOR USE IN THE CALCULATION OF THE LIMIT SHAFT RESISTANCE OF THE PILE AND THE INITIAL DENSITY AND STRESS STATE OF THE SAND.

A PRISMATIC SAND SPECIMEN THAT INITIALLY MEASURED 57 4 MM WIDE X 120.5 MM LONG X 182.1 MM HIGH WAS SHEARED UNDER PLANE STRAIN (BIAXIAL) LOADING CONDITIONS. THE SPECIMEN WAS PREPARED AT A RELATIVE DENSITY OF 79% USING F 75 OTTAWA SAND. X RAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY WAS USED TO SCAN THE SPECIMEN BEFORE SHEARING AND AFTER THE ONSET OF THE SHEAR BAND. THE SPECIMEN FAILED THROUGH A SINGLE SHEAR BAND WITH AN INCLINATION ANGLE OF 65 6 MEASURED FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE MINOR PRINCIPAL STRESS. COMPUTER ALGORITHMS WERE DEVELOPED TO CALIBRATE CT IMAGES AND QUANTIFY VOID RATIO (E) VARIATION WITHIN THE SPECIMEN. CT DATA ANALYSIS REVEALED CROSS SECTIONAL SPATIAL VARIATION IN VOID RATIO WHERE DENSITY IS HIGHER IN REGIONS CLOSE TO THE EDGES OF THE SPECIMEN DUE TO MEMBRANE EFFECTS AND CONFINING PRESSURE WITH NO SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN VOID RATIO IN THE AXIAL DIRECTION (TOP TO BOTTOM) BEFORE SHEARING. THE SHEAR BAND WAS EASILY IDENTIFIED FROM THE CT IMAGES, AND ANALYSIS OF VOID RATIO SHOWED A NOTICEABLE JUMP IN VOID RATIO PROFILE ACROSS THE SHEAR BAND. A DETAILED STATISTICAL SUMMARY OF THE THICKNESS OF THE SHEAR BAND AND VARIATION OF VOID RATIO ACROSS THE SHEAR BAND IS PRESENTED AND DISCUSSED.

ONE DIMENSIONAL STATIC COMPACTION TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT AT HIGH AND MEDIUM WATER CONTENT WITH MATRIC SUCTION MONITORING USING TRENTO HIGH CAPACITY TENSIOMETERS. AT LOWER WATER CONTENTS, A TRANSISTOR PSYCHROMETER WAS USED TO MEASURE POST COMPACTION SUCTION. SAMPLES WERE COMPACTED ON THE DRY SIDE OF OPTIMUM TO COVER A WIDE RANGE OF COMPACTION WATER CONTENTS AND VERTICAL STRESSES. THREE WATER CONTENT REGIONS WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE COMPACTION PLANE DEPENDING ON WHETHER POST COMPACTION SUCTION INCREASED, DECREASED OR REMAINED CONSTANT AS THE DEGREE OF SATURATION WAS INCREASED AT CONSTANT WATER CONTENT. HYDRAULIC PATHS OF SPECIMENS SUBJECTED TO LOADING UNLOADING CYCLES AT CONSTANT WATER CONTENT HAVE CLEARLY SHOWN THAT POST COMPACTION SUCTION MAY INCREASE AS THE DEGREE OF SATURATION INCREASES. THIS NON INTUITIVE BEHAVIOUR WAS DEMONSTRATED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COUPLING BETWEEN MECHANICAL AND WATER RETENTION BEHAVIOUR. TO THIS END, A COUPLED MECHANICAL WATER RETENTION MODEL WAS FORMULATED. IRREVERSIBLE ONE DIMENSIONAL MECHANICAL PATHS WERE MODELLED BY A BOUNDARY SURFACE IN THE SPACE AVERAGE SKELETON VERTICAL STRESS, MODIFIED SUCTION AND VOID RATIO. IRREVERSIBLE HYDRAULIC WETTING PATHS WERE MODELLED BY A BOUNDARY SURFACE IN THE SPACE SUCTION, DEGREE OF SATURATION, AND VOID RATIO. THIS STUDY WAS COMPLETED BY INVESTIGATING THE PORE SIZE DISTRIBUTION OF COMPACTED SAMPLES THROUGH MIP TESTS.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON SATURATED SAND SPECIMENS USING A BIAXIAL SIMPLE SHEAR DEVICE SUGGEST THAT LOADING INVOLVING CHANGES OF DIRECTION MAY INTRODUCE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE LIQUEFACTION RESISTANCE OF COHESIONLESS SOIL. HOWEVER, CENTRIFUGE TEST RESULTS INDICATE THAT BIAXIAL SHAKING HAS ONLY LIMITED IMPACT ON THE LIQUEFACTION POTENTIAL OF LEVEL SAND DEPOSITS. FROM NUMERICAL ANALYSIS, USING A FULLY COUPLED GROUND RESPONSE PROCEDURE (SUMDES) INCORPORATING A COMPREHENSIVE CONSTITUTIVE MODEL FOR SAND, AND A THEORETICAL STUDY ON THE BASIS OF THE THEORY OF PLASTICITY, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE IN SITU K0 CONDITION, AND THE FACT THAT THE MOBILISED SHEAR STRESS UNDER EARTHQUAKE TENDS TO DECREASE AS THE EXCESS PORE PRESSURE BUILDS UP, ABATE THE EFFECT OF MULTIDIRECTIONAL SHEARING ON LEVEL GROUND RESPONSE.

THE FORMULATION IS BASED ON A PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED ISOTROPIC CREEP MODEL, ASSUMING ROTATED MODIFIED CAM CLAY ELLIPSES AS CONTOURS OF VOLUMETRIC CREEP STRAIN RATES. A ROTATIONAL HARDENING LAW IS ADOPTED TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES IN ANISOTROPY DUE TO VISCOUS STRAINS. ALTHOUGH THIS WILL INTRODUCE SOME NEW SOIL PARAMETERS, THEY DO NOT NEED CALIBRATION AS THEY CAN BE EXPRESSED AS FUNCTIONS OF BASIC SOIL PARAMETERS THROUGH SIMPLE ANALYTICAL EXPRESSIONS. TO START WITH, THE ONE DIMENSIONAL RESPONSE OF THE MODEL IS DISCUSSED, MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO EXPLORE HOW THE MODEL IS CAPABLE OF CAPTURING KEY FEATURES OF VISCOUS SOFT SOIL BEHAVIOUR. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE THREE DIMENSIONAL GENERALISATION OF THE MODEL IS PRESENTED, FOLLOWED BY COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTAL DATA, SHOWING GOOD AGREEMENT IN BOTH TRIAXIAL UNDRAINED COMPRESSION AND EXTENSION. IN THE AUTHORS OPINION, THE SIMPLE FORMULATION OF THE MODEL MAKES IT ATTRACTIVE FOR USE IN ENGINEERING PRACTICE.

IT IS SHOWN HOW THE END RESISTANCE MOBILISED BY A PENETROMETER IN A DENSE SAND (I.E. STRONG SOIL) VARIES WITH THE NUMBER OF PENETROMETER DIAMETERS (D) FROM A WEAK SOIL (ASSUMED HERE TO BE EITHER A LOOSE SAND OR SOFT CLAY), AND DEPENDS ON THE RATIO OF THE STEADY STATE PENETRATION RESISTANCES OF THE STRONG AND WEAK LAYERS. THE PENETROMETER RESISTANCE IN THE WEAK SOIL IS NOT AFFECTED BY AN ADJACENT STRONG LAYER AT PENETRATIONS GREATER THAN 2D.

OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES EXPERIMENTAL WORK HAS SHOWN THAT PRE FAILURE BEHAVIOUR IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE PREVIOUS STRESS HISTORY OF THE SOIL. HOWEVER, SOME RESEARCH HAS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT, IF ENOUGH TIME IS ALLOWED FOR CREEP TO TAKE PLACE, THEN THERE IS NO EFFECT OF RECENT STRESS HISTORY; MOREOVER, WHAT AFFECTS SOIL STIFFNESS IS THE DIRECTION OF THE STRESS PATH RELATIVE TO THE GROSS YIELD SURFACE. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE EFFECT OF TWO SCENARIOS ON THE SURFACE SETTLEMENT TROUGH ASSOCIATED WITH TUNNELLING. THE FIRST ASSUMES THAT THE PREVIOUS STRESS HISTORY OF THE SOIL HAS AN EFFECT ON SOIL STIFFNESS, WHEREAS THE SECOND ASSUMES THAT CREEP/AGEING PERIODS HAVE ERASED ANY MEMORY OF THE PREVIOUS STRESS HISTORY, AND IT IS ONLY THE STRESS PATH DIRECTION THAT INFLUENCES SOIL STIFFNESS. A THREE SURFACE KINEMATIC HARDENING MODEL, WHICH CAN SIMULATE BOTH SCENARIOS, IS EMPLOYED IN FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSES OF TUNNEL CONSTRUCTION. THE PREDICTIONS OF THE KINEMATIC HARDENING MODEL FOR THE SIMULATION OF EACH SCENARIO ARE COMPARED WITH PREDICTIONS USING A NON LINEAR ELASTIC MODEL AND WITH FIELD MEASUREMENTS.

GAS MIGRATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF PREFERENTIAL PATHS ALONG EXISTING OR PRESSURE DEPENDENT DISCONTINUITIES. THE MODEL HANDLES THE COMBINED PHENOMENA OF TWO PHASE (AIR AND LIQUID) FLOW AND THE GENERATION OF DISCRETE PATHS. APERTURE OF DISCRETE PATHS IS THE MAIN VARIABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR PERMEABILITY AND CAPILLARY PRESSURE VARIATIONS. THE MODEL, WHICH HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN A GENERAL THERMO HYDROMECHANICAL CODE, IS USED TO SIMULATE TWO EXPERIMENTS (LABORATORY AND FIELD). THE LABORATORY EXPERIMENT INVOLVED GAS FLOW THROUGH SHALE SPECIMENS TESTED IN A TRIAXIAL CELL. IN THE FIELD EXPERIMENT, GAS FLOW WAS FORCED THROUGH A SAND BENTONITE BARRIER.

USING AN IMAGE ANALYSIS BASED TECHNIQUE AND AN APPROPRIATE MATHEMATICAL APPROACH, THE INHERENT FABRICS OF SAND SPECIMENS PREPARED IN THE LABORATORY USING DIFFERENT SAMPLE PREPARATION METHODS WERE MEASURED, QUANTIFIED AND COMPARED AT A MICROSCALE LEVEL. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE SPECIMEN PREPARED BY THE DRY DEPOSITION METHOD HAD A MORE ANISOTROPIC MICROSTRUCTURE THAN THE SPECIMEN PREPARED USING THE MOIST TAMPING METHOD, WHICH IS CONSIDERED DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATION THAT DIFFERENT SAMPLE PREPARATION METHODS PRODUCE SAMPLES WITH DISTINCTIVE RESPONSES UNDER OTHERWISE IDENTICAL CONDITIONS. AN EXISTING PLATFORM MODEL WAS THEN EXTENDED SO THAT THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF INITIAL FABRIC AND SHEAR MODE DEPENDENCE WERE ACCOUNTED FOR IN A SIMPLE YET RATIONAL MANNER. TO CALIBRATE AND VERIFY THE MODEL, A SERIES OF LABORATORY TESTS WAS CONDUCTED FOR TOYOURA SAND UNDER VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF LOADING AND SAMPLE PREPARATION CONDITIONS. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE MODEL IS CAPABLE OF SIMULATING IN A UNIFIED MANNER THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS REFLECTING THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF SAMPLE PREPARATION METHODS, LOADING PATHS, SOIL DENSITIES AND CONFINING PRESSURES.

THE THEORY DEVELOPS NEW EQUATIONS RELATING THE PRESSURE GRADIENT AND TORQUE TO THE SCREW GEOMETRY, THE SHEAR STRESSES ACTING IN THE SCREW CONVEYOR, AND THE MATERIAL FLOW. THE EQUATIONS ARE EXPRESSED IN DIMENSIONLESS FORM, ALLOWING APPLICATION TO SCREW CONVEYORS OF DIFFERENT SCALES. THE THEORY IS VALIDATED AGAINST MEASUREMENTS FROM LABORATORY MODEL SCREW CONVEYOR TESTS WITH CLAY SOILS WITH VARYING PROPERTIES AND OPERATING CONDITIONS. THE THEORY SUCCESSFULLY DESCRIBES KEY FEATURES OF THE OBSERVED MECHANICS OF THE MODEL CONVEYOR OPERATION, AND ACCURATELY PREDICTS THE TEST MEASUREMENTS. THE PROPOSED THEORY PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO THE FUNDAMENTAL MECHANICS OF SCREW CONVEYOR OPERATIONS, AND CAN BE USED IN THE DESIGN OF TUNNELLING MACHINE SCREW CONVEYORS. THE THEORY CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO OTHER FORMS OF SCREW CONVEYORS AND EXTRUDERS OPERATING WITH PLASTIC MATERIALS.

CENTRAL TO THIS MODEL IS THE REALISATION THAT AT LOW EFFECTIVE STRESS LEVELS THE VOID RATIO EFFECTIVE STRESS PATHS OF SOIL ELEMENTS ARE NON UNIQUE, AND DEPENDENT VERY MUCH ON THEIR STATE. BEYOND A THRESHOLD STRESS LEVEL, THESE RELATIONSHIPS BECOME UNIQUE. THESE OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN USED TO DEVELOP A STATE DEPENDENT CONSTITUTIVE MODEL FOR THE COMPRESSIBILITY BEHAVIOUR OF SOFT SEDIMENTS. METHODS TO OBTAIN THE INPUT PARAMETERS OF THE MODEL ARE DISCUSSED. THE PROPOSED MODEL IS USED TO SOLVE FINITE STRAIN ONE DIMENSIONAL CONSOLIDATION WITH PERTINENT INITIAL AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS. THE ANALYSES PERFORMED USING A FINITE DIFFERENCE COMPUTER CODE PREDICT BETTER THE OBSERVED PHENOMENA ASSOCIATED WITH SELF WEIGHT CONSOLIDATION, ESPECIALLY DURING ITS EARLY STAGES. THE COMPARISON OF THE PREDICTIONS SHOWS THAT THE PRESENT MODEL CAN CAPTURE THE DECREASE IN VOID RATIO PATTERNS, AS OBSERVED IN EXPERIMENTS AT LOW EFFECTIVE STRESSES, AND WHICH CANNOT BE MODELLED USING EXISTING CONSTITUTIVE RELATIONSHIPS.

IN THIS PAPER THE POTENTIAL OF A VERTICAL DIAPHRAGM WALL TO MODIFY THE DISPLACEMENT FIELD INDUCED BY TUNNEL EXCAVATION IS INVESTIGATED. A SERIES OF CENTRIFUGE TESTS WERE PERFORMED IN WHICH A DIAPHRAGM WALL WAS EMBEDDED TO ONE SIDE OF A TUNNEL. THE LOCATION OF THE WALL, ITS LENGTH, THICKNESS AND THE ROUGHNESS OF THE WALL SOIL INTERFACE WERE VARIED. IN ADDITION, A SERIES OF NUMERICAL ANALYSES WERE CARRIED OUT TO SUPPLEMENT THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE FIELD OF DISPLACEMENTS WAS MODIFIED IN DIFFERENT WAYS, DEPENDING ON THE COMBINATION OF THE ABOVE FACTORS, AND THE SENSITIVITY OF THE PROBLEM TO THE VARIATION OF EACH FACTOR IS DISCUSSED. AN EFFICIENCY PARAMETER IS DEFINED THAT EXPRESSES THE ABILITY OF THE WALL TO MODIFY THE REFERENCE (NO WALL) PROFILE OF SETTLEMENTS.

UNSTABLE RESPONSE WITH A SUDDEN REDUCTION IN SHEAR STRENGTH AFTER PEAK WAS OBSERVED UNDER UNDRAINED MONOTONIC LOADING. AFTER A QUASI STEADY STATE THE SPECIMENS SHOWED A PHASE TRANSFORMATION AND A TENDENCY TO DILATION. DRAINED TORSIONAL HOLLOW CYLINDER TESTS SHOWED AN EQUIVALENT CHARACTERISTIC STATE MARKING THE TRANSITION BETWEEN CONTRACTANT AND DILATANT BEHAVIOUR AND THE SAME LINE AT PHASE TRANSFORMATION AS THEIR UNDRAINED COUNTERPARTS. THE INSTABILITY LINE, DEFINED UNDER MONOTONIC LOADING, APPEARS TO FORM A BOUNDARY TO THE BEHAVIOUR OF SAND UNDER CYCLIC LOADING. UNSTABLE BEHAVIOUR IS INTRODUCED WHEN THE EFFECTIVE STRESS PATH FOLLOWED BY THE SPECIMEN DURING CYCLIC LOADING REACHES THE INSTABILITY LINE AT A SHEAR STRAIN OF APPROXIMATELY 0 5%. THE FIRST LOADING CYCLE IS AT VARIANCE WITH THE FOLLOWING CYCLES IN TERMS OF THE STRESS DILATANCY RELATIONSHIP IN DRAINED OR THE EXCESS PORE WATER PRESSURE GENERATION IN UNDRAINED TORSIONAL HOLLOW CYLINDER TESTS.

THE NEW CRITERION IS A FUNCTION OF THE THREE STRESS INVARIANTS AND THE PAPER SHOWS THE WELL KNOWN CRITERIA BY MATSUOKA & NAKAI (1974) AND LADE & DUNCAN (1975) ARE INCLUDED IN THE NEW FORMULATION. IN ORDER TO INCLUDE DIFFERENT FEATURES CHARACTERISING SOIL AND ROCK BEHAVIOUR, THE OBTAINED FUNCTION IS SUCCESSIVELY MODIFIED TO ACCOUNT FOR TENSILE STRENGTH AND CURVATURE IN MERIDIAN PLANES. THE INFLUENCE OF EACH PARAMETER IS DISCUSSED AND FINALLY THE COMPARISON BETWEEN THE NEW CRITERION AND SOME EXPERIMENTAL DATA ON SOILS AND ROCKS IS SHOWN. FINALLY, THE DOMAIN OF THE NEW CRITERION IS ANALYSED IN ORDER TO SHOW IF THE YIELD FUNCTION TAKES NEGATIVE VALUES ALSO OUTSIDE THE SHOWN ELASTIC DOMAIN.

UTILISING THE PASTOR ZIENKIEWICZ ELASTOPLASTIC CONSTITUTIVE MODEL, AN EFFECTIVE STRESS DYNAMIC ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED USING AS INPUT THE ACCELEROGRAM RECORDED 32 M BELOW THE GROUND SURFACE IN THE NEARBY PORT ISLAND. THE EVOLUTION DURING SHAKING OF LATERAL DISPLACEMENTS, PLASTIC STRAINS AND PORE WATER PRESSURES SHEDS SOME LIGHT ON THE COMPLEX INTERPLAY OF SEVERAL SIMULTANEOUSLY OCCURRING PHENOMENA: THE DEVELOPMENT OF OSCILLATORY INERTIA FORCES ON THE WALL, IN PHASE OR OUT OF PHASE WITH THE BACKFILL SOIL AND WATER PRESSURES; THE SIMPLE SHEAR SEISMIC DEFORMATION OF THE SOIL AND THE ENSUING INITIAL DEVELOPMENT OF POSITIVE EXCESS PORE WATER PRESSURES IN THE BACKFILL AND THE FOUNDATION SOIL; THE EXTENSIONAL DEFORMATION DEVELOPING IN THE ACTIVE WEDGE BEHIND THE WALL, WITH THE ENSUING GENERATION OF NEGATIVE EXCESS PORE WATER PRESSURES; AND THE CONTINUOUS DISSIPATION AND REDISTRIBUTION OF WATER PRESSURES. THE CONVENTIONAL GENERALISED MONONOBE OKABE THEORY IS ALSO REVIEWED, AND EXTENSIVE COMPARISONS ARE MADE WITH THE NUMERICALLY COMPUTED EFFECTIVE AND WATER PRESSURES AGAINST THE WALL. FINALLY, A SURPRISING ROLE OF THE RELATIVE DENSITY OF RUBBLE BEHIND THE WALL IS HIGHLIGHTED.

WITH ADVANCES IN THE USE OF BENDER ELEMENTS FOR SOIL TESTING, ANISOTROPIC SHEAR MODULI GO(Y) CAN NOW BE EVALUATED BY MEASURING THE VELOCITIES OF SHEAR WAVES PROPAGATING IN A SOIL SPECIMEN IN DIFFERENT PLANES AND POLARISATIONS. THIS LEADS TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE STIFFNESS ANISOTROPY AT VERY SMALL STRAINS. WHILE ALMOST ALL PREVIOUS STUDIES OF ANISOTROPIC SOIL STIFFNESS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED WITH SATURATED SOILS, EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS FROM UNSATURATED SOILS HAVE RARELY BEEN REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE. A NEW COMPUTER CONTROLLED TRIAXIAL APPARATUS EQUIPPED WITH THREE PAIRS OF BENDER ELEMENTS WAS DEVELOPED TO MEASURE SHEAR WAVE VELOCITIES AND HENCE TO INVESTIGATE THE DEGREE OF STIFFNESS ANISOTROPY OF RECOMPACTED COMPLETELY DECOMPOSED TUFF (CDT) UNDER BOTH SATURATED AND UNSATURATED CONDITIONS. THE AXISTRANSLATION TECHNIQUE WAS APPLIED TO CONTROL MATRIC SUCTION. NEW STATE DEPENDENT EQUATIONS DESCRIBING ANISOTROPIC MODULI OF UNSATURATED SOIL WERE DERIVED AND VERIFIED BY EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS. BASED ON THE DERIVED EQUATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS, IT WAS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY THAT THERE WAS AN INHERENT SHEAR STIFFNESS ANISOTROPY OF ABOUT 1.03 1.04, DUE TO SAMPLE PREPARATION BY MOIST TAMPING, FOR ISOTROPIC NET MEAN STRESS VARYING FROM 110 TO 400 KPA. WHEN SUCTION WAS INCREASED FROM 0 KPA TO THE AIR ENTRY VALUE OF 50 KPA, SUCTION INDUCED ANISOTROPY IN TERMS OF THE SHEAR STIFFNESS RATIO, G 0(HH)/G 0(HV), RANGED FROM ABOUT 1.06 TO 1.09 FOR ISOTROPIC NET MEAN STRESS VARYING FROM 110 TO 500 KPA. NO FURTHER SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SUCTION INDUCED STIFFNESS ANISOTROPY WAS OBSERVED AT SUCTIONS HIGHER THAN THE AIR ENTRY VALUE.

THE TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT FOR CAISSONS OF DIFFERENT SIZE AND SURCHARGE (OR EFFECTIVE WEIGHT). FINITE ELEMENT (FE) SIMULATIONS WERE ALSO CONDUCTED TO STUDY AND EXPLAIN THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS. DATA FROM TWO FIELD INSTALLATIONS AND OTHER MODEL TESTS WERE INVESTIGATED, AND COMPARED WITH THE RESULTS FROM THE CENTRIFUGE MODEL TESTS. THE SUCTION PRESSURE WAS OBSERVED TO INCREASE RELATIVELY LINEARLY WITH EMBEDMENT DEPTH, FOLLOWING A DISTINCT SLOPE THAT IS RELATED TO ESTABLISHING A CRITICAL HYDRAULIC GRADIENT ALONG THE INNER CAISSON WALL. THE TOTAL DRIVING FORCE (WEIGHT PLUS PRESSURE DIFFERENTIAL) REQUIRED FOR SUCTION INSTALLATION IS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED COMPARED WITH THE FORCE REQUIRED TO INSTALL THE CAISSON BY JACKING. WHEN A LARGER SURCHARGE WAS USED, THE REQUIRED SUCTION PRESSURE DECREASED FOR A GIVEN PENETRATION DEPTH, BUT THE TOTAL FORCE INCREASED. BY CONTRAST, THE INITIAL CAISSON PENETRATION DEPTH DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE REQUIRED SUCTION PRESSURE. THE OVERALL BEHAVIOUR AND THE PRESSURE VARIATION WITH DEPTH WERE SIMILAR FOR CAISSONS OF DIFFERENT SIZES, AND WALL THICKNESS. SUBSEQUENT FE ANALYSES APPEARED TO EXPLAIN THIS OBSERVATION WELL, AND A CONSISTENT PATTERN OF BEHAVIOUR WAS ESTABLISHED FOR ALL THE MODEL AND FIELD DATA.

THE TEST SERIES INVESTIGATED FOOTINGS OF VARIOUS WIDTHS LOADED AT DISPLACEMENT RATES EXTENDING OVER FIVE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. ADDITIONAL TESTS WERE PERFORMED TO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE ON UPLIFT CAPACITY OF THE DIRECTION OF LOAD INCLINATION. THE UPLIFT TESTS PERFORMED ON FOOTINGS FOUNDED ON SAND ENABLED ESTIMATIONS TO BE MADE OF THE SUCTION THAT DEVELOPED AT THE BASE OF THE FOOTINGS FOUNDED ON CLAY. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE SUCTION MOBILISED AT VERY FAST RATES MAY BE ASSESSED USING EXISTING UNDRAINED BEARING CAPACITY APPROACHES AND A (RATE CORRECTED) OPERATIONAL UNDRAINED STRENGTH SIMILAR TO THAT MEASURED IN TRIAXIAL EXTENSION. THE UPLIFT RATES REQUIRED TO REACH FULLY UNDRAINED CONDITIONS ARE ALMOST TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN THOSE FOR FOOTINGS LOADED IN COMPRESSION, AND THE UPWARD FOOTING DISPLACEMENTS REQUIRED TO GENERATE MAXIMUM RESISTANCE CAN BE UP TO 10% OF THE FOOTING WIDTH. THESE FINDINGS HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR SHALLOW FOUNDATIONS SUCH AS THOSE USED TO SUPPORT HIGHVOLTAGE ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION LINE SUPPORT STRUCTURES.

AN ISOTROPIC CELL PERMITTING SIMULTANEOUS CONTROL OF SUCTION, TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE WAS USED TO STUDY THE THERMO MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF THIS CLAY. TESTS WERE PERFORMED AT TOTAL SUCTIONS RANGING FROM 9 TO 110 MPA, TEMPERATURES RANGING FROM 25C TO 80C, AND ISOTROPIC PRESSURES FROM 0 1 TO 60MPA. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT HEATING AT CONSTANT SUCTION AND PRESSURE INDUCES EITHER SWELLING OR CONTRACTION. THE RESULTS FROM COMPRESSION TESTS AT CONSTANT SUCTION AND TEMPERATURE SHOWED THAT, AT LOWER SUCTION, THE YIELD PRESSURE WAS LOWER, AND THE ELASTIC COMPRESSIBILITY AND PLASTIC COMPRESSIBILITY PARAMETERS WERE HIGHER. BY CONTRAST, AT A SIMILAR SUCTION, THE YIELD PRESSURE WAS SLIGHTLY INFLUENCED BY THE TEMPERATURE, AND THE COMPRESSIBILITY PARAMETERS WERE INSENSITIVE TO TEMPERATURE CHANGES. THE THERMAL HARDENING PHENOMENON WAS EQUALLY EVIDENCED BY FOLLOWING A THERMOMECHANICAL PATH OF LOADING HEATING COOLING RELOADING.

THIS PAPER REPORTS AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE EFFECT OF THE OVERCONSOLIDATION OF INFILLED ROUGH JOINTS ON UN DRAINED SHEAR BEHAVIOUR. A REVISED MODEL IS PRESENTED FOR PREDICTING THE SHEAR STRENGTH OF ROUGH INFILLED JOINTS ON THE BASIS OF EXPERIMENTAL TESTS CARRIED OUT ON IDEALISED SAWTOOTHED JOINTS WITH NATURAL SILTY CLAY AS THE INFILL MATERIAL. TESTS WERE CONDUCTED UNDER CONSOLIDATED UNDRAINED CONDITIONS IN A HIGH PRESSURE TRIAXIAL APPARATUS ON JOINTS HAVING A DIP ANGLE OF 60. PORE PRESSURE DEVELOPMENT IN THE INFILL MATERIALS WAS MONITORED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE EFFECT OF ASPERITIES ON SHEAR STRENGTH IS SIGNIFICANT UP TO A CRITICAL ASPERITY HEIGHT TO INFILL THICKNESS RATIO (T/A), WHEREAS THE SHEAR BEHAVIOUR IS CONTROLLED BY THE INFILL ALONE BEYOND THIS CRITICAL VALUE. THE PROPOSED MODEL FOR PREDICTING THE SHEAR STRENGTH OF ROUGH INFILLED JOINTS DESCRIBES HOW THE OCR INFLUENCES THE SHEAR STRENGTH, PORE WATER PRESSURE DEVELOPMENT, AND CRITICAL T/A RATIO.
