CHARLES PEARSON ENVISIONED A PLAN THAT INVOLVED CONSTRUCTION OF A HUGE CENTRAL STATION FOR THE LONDON CITY WITH UNDERGROUND RAILWAYS CONNECTING THE MAIN LINE TERMINI THAT WERE DEVELOPING AT THE EDGE OF THE CITY. REFORMER. HE WANTED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE POOR OF LONDON TO MOVE OUT OF THEIR SLUMS AND TRAVEL EASILY AND CHEAPLY INTO LONDON FROM NEW TOWNS PLANNED FOR LOCATIONS SUCH AS HORNSEY OR TOTTENHAM. THE 1854 5 COMMONS SELECT COMMITTEE ON METROPOLITAN COMMUNICATIONS TOOK A FAVORABLE VIEW OF PEARSONS ARGUMENTS AND RECOMMENDED THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN UNDERGROUND RAILWAY TO CONNECT THE VARIOUS TERMINI WITH A CENTRAL STATION AT FARRINGDON. COMPENSATION. FINANCIAL BACKING FOR THE METROPOLITAN RAILWAY COMPANY WAS SLOW TO MATERIALIZE. WHILE THE GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY WAS PREPARED TO INVEST GBP 175,000 THE GREAT NORTHERN WAS MORE RELUCTANT.

TBMS WERE CHOSEN FOR THE TWIN DRIVES OF THE 4.6KM LONG LEGACY TUNNEL IN THE QUEENSLAND CAPITAL OF BRISBANE. NOT ONLY ARE HARD ROCK MACHINES WELL SUITED TO THE SOUND IGNEOUS ROCK UNDERNEATH THE HOUSES OF THE WELL OFF WESTERN SUBURBS, BUT ALSO BECAUSE THERE WERE MACHINES AVAILABLE IN THE CITY. THE TBMS ALSO HAPPEN TO BE THE RIGHT SIZE AND CAPACITY. LIKE THE CLEM 7, WHICH OPENED IN 2009, THE LEGACY TUNNEL WILL BE A TWIN, TWO LANE MOTORWAY, RUNNING BENEATH AND INTO THE CENTRAL PART OF THE CITY, WHICH HAS BEEN GROWING MORE AND MORE CONGESTED. THE FIRST, CLEM 7, TUNNEL RUNS FROM THE SOUTHERN SUBURBS UNDERNEATH THE BRISBANE RIVER, AND THE NEW TUNNEL WILL BRING IN TRAFFIC FROM THE WEST. THE TRANSAPEX PROJECT, AS IT IS CALLED, HAS SO FAR SEEN THE BUILDING OF THE CLEM 7 AND THE Y SHAPED AIRPORT LINK INTO THE NORTHERN SUBURBS AND AS THE NAME SUGGESTS TO THE AIRPORT NEAR THE COAST.

THE NUMBER OF JOBS IN THE CITY IS PROJECTED TO RISE BY APPROACHING 20 PER CENT IN THE SAME PERIOD. THE LONDON UNDERGROUND IS THE BUSIEST IT HAS EVER BEEN. IN RECENT YEARS ANNUAL PASSENGER JOURNEY NUMBERS HAVE RISEN STEADILY REACHING OVER 1.2BN IN THE 2012/2013 YEAR. ON A TYPICAL WEEK DAY OVER 4M INDIVIDUAL JOURNEYS ARE MADE. ON TUESDAY AUGUST 7, 2012 DURING THE LONDON OLYMPIC GAMES A RECORD PEAK OF 4.57 MILLION PASSENGERS USED THE TUBE. LOOKING AHEAD CURRENT PROJECTIONS SUGGEST ANNUAL JOURNEYS WILL REACH 1.5BN BY 2020. LU HAS COMMITTED TO A PROGRAM OF LINE AND STATION UPGRADES. THE LINE UPGRADES DELIVER NEW SIGNALING SYSTEMS AND IN MANY CASES ALSO NEW TRAINS, TO INCREASE CAPACITY BY PUSHING MORE TRAINS THROUGH THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE.

THE LONDON UNDERGROUND WAS POISED FOR GROWTH AT THE START OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR IN 1914. ALL BUT THE METROPOLITAN WERE INCORPORATED IN THE UNDERGROUND ELECTRIC RAILWAY LIMITED, WHICH HAD BEEN FORMED BY THE AMERICAN TYCOON, CHARLES TYSON YERKES. THE MOST SERIOUS DANGER IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR IN LONDON WAS BOMBING EITHER BY ZEPPELINS OR PLANES. THERE WERE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS AS THEY INTERFERED WITH THE PASSENGERS. AS THE UNDERGROUND WAS PERCEIVED AS SAFER AND WITH THE ADDITIONAL NUMBERS DUE TO MANY TROOPS MOVING AROUND THE CAPITAL, THE USE OF THE SYSTEM INCREASED DRAMATICALLY DURING THE WAR. PEOPLE BECAME MORE ACCUSTOMED TO USING THE UNDERGROUND. EVENTUALLY, IT WAS DECIDED THAT TRAINS SHOULD PROCEED SLOWLY DURING RAIDS. THE IMPACT OF THE SECOND WORLD WARFROM 1939 TO 1945 ON THE LONDON UNDERGROUND WAS MUCH MORE PROFOUND AND DRAMATIC. THE WAR WAS NOT UNEXPECTED AND PLANS FOR THE EMERGENCY WERE MADE AS EARLY AS 1937.

THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES HOW UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE FACED NEGLECT AND UNDERINVESTMENT DURING 1963 AND 2013. WITH THE NATIONALIZATION OF LAND TRANSPORT IN 1948 IT BECAME A PART OF THE BEHEMOTH THAT WAS THE BRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION (BTC). IT WAS A PERIOD OF STATE CONTROL OF SERVICES, BUT THIS WAS AN INTERESTING STEP AS IT EFFECTIVELY RENATIONALISED A PUBLIC SECTOR ENTITY. THE TREASURY EFFECTIVELY CONTROLLED THE BTC. WITH A NATION CRYING OUT FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO HEALTH, A NEED FOR ELECTRICITY AND MAJOR NEW HOUSE BUILDING PROJECTS; LONDONS INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS WERE PERHAPS A SECONDARY CONCERN. BTC WAS ABOLISHED IN 1963 IN FAVOR OF DIRECT MINISTERIAL CONTROL OF THE NETWORK. HOWEVER, THIS DIDNT BENEFIT THE BUDGET. RECORDS SHOW GBP 1.1M AVAILABLE FOR IMPROVEMENTS ANNUALLY. IN 1970, LT BECAME PART OF THE IOCAI GOVERNMENT BODY, GREATER LONDON COUNCIL (GLC). HOWEVER, SINCE THE NEW WORKS PROGRAM OF THE 1930S, THE UNDERGROUND HAD LANGUISHED THROUGH THREE DECADES OF NEGLECT.

THE TUNNEL IS EQUIPPED WITH A SEMI TRANSVERSAL VENTILATION SYSTEM WITH SMOKE EXTRACTION DAMPERS, WHICH WAS DESIGNED IN THE 1990S. THE FIRST TEST WAS A SUCCESS. ALTHOUGH THE SMOKE EXTRACTION CAPACITY WAS NOT SUFFICIENT, DUE TO HIGH DUCT LEAKAGES, THE FIRE VENTILATION SYSTEM WAS ABLE TO LIMIT THE SPREAD OF SMOKE AND FINALLY TO REMOVE THE FUMES FROM THE TUNNEL.

THE ELECTED SITE IN SWEDEN IS AT FORSMARK, NORTH EAST OF STOCKHOLM, AND IT HAD TO COMPETE FOR THE RIGHT TO BE THE CANDIDATE SITE. AFTER YEARS OF SITE INVESTIGATION, THE SWEDISH NUCLEAR FUEL AND WASTE MANAGEMENT CO FILED AN APPLICATION FOR THE LICENSE TO CONSTRUCT AND OPERATE THE HIGH LEVEL WASTE VAULT IN 2011. SITE INVESTIGATION DATA HAD REVEALED STRESSES IN THE GRANITIC ROCK MASS, WHICH IS PART OF THE FENNOSCANDIAN SHIELD, TO BE LESS THAN EXPECTED; THE STRESS PROFILE DID NOT RISE WITH DEPTH AS QUICKLY AS HAD BEEN ESTIMATED. LESS STRESS MEANT MORE OPPORTUNITY TO EXCAVATE, AND AT DEEPER DEPTHS, TO CREATE STORAGE VAULTS WITHOUT DETRIMENTAL STRESS RELEASE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE QUALITY OF THE ROCK MASS. THE RESULT WAS THAT A VAULT COULD BE LOCATED ABOUT 470M BELOW THE SURFACE AT FORSMARK, OR ALMOST THE SAME DEPTH OSKARSHAMN.

TUNNEL FIRES CAN GENERATE LARGE QUANTITIES OF VERY HOT SMOKE. THIS SMOKE IS THERMALLY BUOYANT AND TENDS TO ACCUMULATE IN A HOT LAYER IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE SOFFIT OF THE TUNNEL. IN THE UK, AS IN MANY OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, IT HAS BECOME STANDARD PRACTICE TO INCLUDE THE INSTALLATION OF PASSIVE FIRE PROTECTION AS A PART OF THE DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR A TUNNEL REFURBISHMENT. THE APPLICATION OF PASSIVE FIRE PROTECTION SERVES TO THERMALLY INSULATE THE STRUCTURE OF THE TUNNEL FROM THE EFFECTS OF A FIRE, THEREBY PROTECT IT FROM FIRE DAMAGE. THE APPLICATION OF THERMAL INSULATION DOES NOT, OF COURSE, REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF HEAT ENERGY EMITTED BY THE FIRE. IT SIMPLY PREVENTS THAT HEAT ENERGY FROM BEING ABSORBED. A GOOD STARTING POINT TO START TO LOOK AT POTENTIAL FIRE DAMAGE IS TO EXAMINE IN MORE DETAIL THE STRUCTURE OF TUNNEL CABLES.

THE 21 KM SECTION THE DOWNTOWN LINE THREE IN SINGAPORE IS UNDERWAY, USING 29 TBMS EXCAVATING BETWEEN 16 STATION SITES IN SHORT BORES OFTEN LESS THAN 1 KM EACH. THE EFFECT OF THESE LARGE PROJECTS IS EQUALLY MASSIVE: WHOLE NEW SUBWAY SYSTEMS BUILT IN A SINGLE PUSH HAVE A LARGE IMPACT ON THE LOCAL POPULATION, ARE LOGISTICALLY COMPLEX, REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING, AND CAN PRESENT MANY CHALLENGES TO THE TUNNELING COMMUNITY. IN RUSSIAS CAPITAL CITY OF MORE THAN 12 MILLION PEOPLE, THE AVERAGE MUSCOVITE HAS BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO DAILY COMMUTES OF TWO HOURS OR MORE. THE METRO SYSTEM, NEARLY ENTIRELY UNDERGROUND, INVOLVES THE USE OF DOZENS OF MIXED GROUND EPBMS: THE LARGEST SIMULTANEOUS CONSTRUCTION BY TBM THAT HAS EVER TAKEN PLACE IN THE CITY.

THE CONTINUOUS INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR BETTER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE TRAVEL FACILITIES IN MAJOR CITIES HAS LED TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE INTEREST IN ROUTING ROADS, RAILWAYS AND METROS THROUGH TUNNELS. DUE TO THE ABUNDANCE OF EXISTING UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE AT DEEPER DEPTHS, TUNNELS IN URBAN AREAS ARE OFTEN BEING CONSTRUCTED AT SHALLOW DEPTHS. BOTTOM UP CONSTRUCTION INVOLVES THE EXCAVATION OF A TRENCH IN WHICH THE TUNNEL IS ERECTED. TEMPORARY STRUCTURES, SUCH AS SHEET PILE WALLS, SECANT PILE WALLS, TANGENT PILE WALLS OR SHEET PILE WALLS ARE USUALLY REQUIRED AND INSTALLED BEFORE THE EXCAVATION TAKES PLACE TO SUPPORT IT. PROVIDING UNREINFORCED SIDE SLOPES MAY REQUIRE THE REMOVAL OF UP TO SIX TIMES MORE MATERIAL, AND SPREAD AN ADDITIONAL THREE TUNNEL DIAMETERS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE EXCAVATION FOR TUNNELS WITH DEPTH OF COVER EQUAL TO ITS DIAMETER.

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF ALL TUNNELING WORKS AT TCRSU WAS TO MINIMIZE GROUND MOVEMENTS. TO THIS EXTENT REDUCING EXCAVATED AREA, SPEED TO TUNNEL RING CLOSURE AND CONTROLLED TUNNEL ADVANCES WERE CRITICAL. THE PRIMARY GROUND SUPPORT FOR THE MAIN TUNNELS IS STEEL FIBER REINFORCED SPRAYED CONCRETE WITH A SPRAY APPLIED WATERPROOF MEMBRANE LOCATED AT THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY LININGS. THE INSTALLATION OF THE STEEL FRAMES WAS MADE SIGNIFICANTLY EASIER BECAUSE THEY WERE CARRIED OUT WITHIN THE TEMPORARY SCL SHELL. REMOVAL OF THE CROWN SEGMENTS OF THE PLATFORM TUNNELS REQUIRED A FULL LINE CLOSURE AND EACH WAS CARRIED OUT DURING A 52 HOUR WEEKEND POSSESSION. TO ENSURE SPEED OF INSTALLATION, STEEL I BEAMS WERE HALF CAST IN CONCRETE SO THEY COULD BE LOWERED INTO PLACE AND ACT AS PERMANENT FORMWORK FOR THE OVERBRIDGE FLOOR SLAB.

ROUND LINING INTERACTION CONTROL IS ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL PROCESSES DURING A TUNNELING PROJECTS IMPLEMENTATION. SOME OF THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION DECISIONS DURING A TUNNEL PROJECT ARE VERY CRITICAL TO REDUCE THE GROUND MOVEMENTS AROUND THE EXCAVATED TUNNEL. TUNNEL LININGS ARE STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS, BUT DIFFER FROM OTHER STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS IN THEIR INTERACTION WITH THE SURROUNDING GROUND, WHICH IS AN INTEGRAL ASPECT OF THEIR BEHAVIOR, STABILITY AND OVERALL LOAD CARRYING CAPACITY. THE LOSS OR LACK OF SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE SURROUNDING GROUND CAN LEAD TO A FAILURE OF THE LINING. THE TUNNEL LINING DEFORMATION ALLOWS THE MOMENTS IN THE TUNNEL LINING TO REDISTRIBUTE THE MAIN LOAD INSIDE THE LINING WHICH ARE AXIAL OR ECCENTRIC LOAD. THE MOST EFFICIENT TUNNEL LINING IS ONE THAT HAS HIGH FLEXIBILITY AND DUCTILITY.

THE MAJORITY OF THE SCL TUNNELS ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE LONDON CLAY STRATUM WITH A VERY LOW PERMEABILITY. THEREFORE UNDRAINED SOIL PARAMETERS ARE CONSIDERED FOR THE ANALYSIS OF TUNNEL EXCAVATION STAGES AND THE PRIMARY LINING INSTALLATION. THE PRIMARY LINING IS DESIGNED ONLY TO CARRY TEMPORARY LOADS AND THE FINAL LINING TO SUSTAIN THE PROBABLE LONG TERM LOADS, ASSUMING THAT THE PRIMARY LINING DETERIORATES IN TIME. PRIOR TO ACTIVATING THE SECONDARY LINING IN THE MODEL, THE PRIMARY LINING BECOMES SACRIFICIAL BY SETTING ITS STIFFNESS TO ONE PER CENT OF THE ORIGINAL VALUE, HENCE THE LOADS UNDERTAKEN BY PRIMARY LINING BECOME NEGLIGIBLE AND THE LOADS ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE SECONDARY LINING.

SAUER AND PARTNERS, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM; GAKIS, A., LONDON OFFICE OF DR. SAUER AND PARTNERS, UNITED KINGDOM; BEDI, A., IMPERIAL COLLEGE, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM	THE INTENTION OF THIS PAPER HAS BEEN TO PRESENT NUMERICAL MODELLING FOR TUNNELLING FROM A LESS ACADEMIC, MORE PRACTICAL POINT OF VIEW AND TO PROVIDE SOME USEFUL CONCEPTS AND INSIGHTS FOR ENGINEERS. AS A SUMMARY, THE FOLLOWING POINTS ARE RECOMMENDED: Â–  EVEN THE MOST SOPHISITCATED NUMERICAL MODEL IS INCAPABLE OF GIVING AN EXACT ANSWER. NUMERICAL MODELS DO HAVE LIMITATIONS, AND PERIL TO THE PROJECT LURKS WHEN THE RESULTS OF A MODEL ARE TRUSTED BLINDLY. HOWEVER, WHEN THE LIMITS OF THE MODEL ARE UNDERSTOOD, NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS CAN YIELD VEIY USEFUL INFORMATION. AS WITH MOST TASKS, WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE KNOW, BUT WE MUST ALSO KNOW WHAT WE DONT. Â–  MODELS ARE BUT MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS BASED ON FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING THEORIES. ENGINEERS SHOULD ALWAYS QUESTION AND CHALLENGE THEIR MODELS UP TO THE POINT THEY ARE ABLE TO EXPLAIN AND DEFEND THE RESULTS BASED ON THEORY AND/OR EXPERIENCE. CONFIDENCE IN THE ANALYSIS RESULTS SHOULD ARISE FROM AGREEMENT WITH RELEVANT PAST EXPERIENCE, CROSS CHECKING WITH ANALYTICAL OR SIMPLIFIED NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS, AND ABOVE ALL COMMON ENGINEERING SENSE. Â–  MODELLING ENGINEERS SHOULD KNOW THE HABITS OF THE SOFTWARE THEY ARE USING, ITS PROS AND CONS, AND TO DEVELOP A THOROUGH CHECKLIST THAT SIMPLIFIES THE MODELLING AND MOREOVER THE DEBUGGING PROCESS. NOTE ALSO, IN A POORLY CONSTRUCTED MODEL, DEBUGGING MAY TAKE UP TO 90 PER CENT OF THE OVERALL EFFORT. Â–  DECISIONS ON THE ANALYSIS APPROACH NEED TO BE ALIGNED WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROJECT TEAM. IT IS SOMETIMES PREFERABLE, DEPENDING ON THE CAPACITIES OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED, TO USE SIMPLER MODELS (E.G. SIMPLE CONSTITUTIVE LAWS) THAT ARE BETTER UNDERSTOOD AND COMMUNICATED. NUMERICAL MODELS ARE BUILT IN ORDER TO SUPPORT A PRE SPECIFIED ENGINEERS DECISION AND THEY SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD IN THIS CONTEXT. THIS, WHEN BALANCED WITH THE PROJECT BUDGET CAN LEAD TO AN EFFICIENT ANALYSIS CAMPAIGN. COPYRIGHT  2013 CATERPILLAR.

URUP, AN ABBREVIATION FOR ULTRA RAPID UNDER PASS, IS A SHAFTIESS SHIELD TECHNOLOGY. THE TBM IS LAUNCHED AND ARRIVES AT GROUND LEVEL AND DRIVES UNDER SHALLOW COVER WITHOUT GROUND TREATMENT. URUP WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED AS A METHOD TO BORE TUNNELS PASSING UNDER ROADWAYS OR RAILWAYS IN ORDER TO TECHNICALLY DIFFERENTIATE OBAYASHI IN THE EVER MORE COMPETITIVE GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC TUNNELLING MARKETS. OBAYASHI INITIALLY CARRIED OUT AN EXPERIMENTAL SHAFTIESS TUNNEL AT THEIR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE WHERE A LOOM LONG BORE WITH COVER RANGING FROM 0.65M TO 2.2M WAS CONSTRUCTED USING A PROTOTYPE RECTANGULAR SHIELD EQUIPPED WITH AN EXCAVATION WIDTH OF 4.8M AND HEIGHT OF 2.1 5M. OBAYASHI CONFIRMED THE FEASIBILITY OF THE SYSTEM BY DEVELOPING A VALID LINING DESIGN UNDER VERY SHALLOW COVER. THE TBM REAPPEARED AT THE STARTING POINT AFTER SUCCESSFULLY BORING UNDER A COVER OF 1.2M WITH MAXIMUM GROUND SETTLEMENT OF ONLY 10MM OR LESS. THE TRAFFIC ABOVE THE TUNNEL WAS UNINTERRUPTED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DURATION OF TUNNEL CONSTRUCTION WORK.

THE FIRST COVERS WATER INGRESS TO A MOUNTAIN MINE ACCESS TUNNEL, WHILE THE SECOND COVERS WATERPROOFING FOR A PRESSURIZED WATER TUNNEL. WATERTIGHTNESS WAS ACHIEVED BY POLYMER MODIFICATION. SPRAYED CONCRETE IS USED AS THE FIRST COVER LAYER IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF SOME TUNNELS; IT GENERALLY IS NOT REQUIRED TO PERFORM ANY OTHER FUNCTION. ALTHOUGH ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS HAVE RAISED AWARENESS OF THE VALUE OF SINGLE SHELL TUNNEL CONSTRUCTION, CONVENTIONAL CONSTRUCTION METHODS ARE GENERALLY USED. YET, WHILE THE DEFORMATION OF THE MOUNTAIN SUBSIDES WITH TIME, AND THE SPRAYED CONCRETE LAYER IS DISREGARDED IN TERMS OF STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS, THE INNER SHELL CAN BE CALCULATED ACCURATELY, BECAUSE IT IS UNAFFECTED. THE ROUGH SPRAYED SURFACE OF THE INITIAL LAYER SUFFICES TO ALLOW FOR GOOD ADHESIVE BONDING BETWEEN THE SPRAYED CONCRETE LAYERS; THE CONCRETE STRUCTURE CAN THEREFORE BE REGARDED AS MONOLITHIC.

IN MODERN TIMES, THE VIEW IS THAT HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO ENSURE A PROTECTED AND PLEASANT WORKING ENVIRONMENT. ALTHOUGH THE PRIMARY CAUSES OF ACCIDENTS IN TUNNELS ARE SLIPS, TRIPS AND FALLS, AND MANY WOULD HAVE THE SAFETY FOCUS ON THESE, THERE ARE PASSIVE MEASURES THAT CAN BE PUT IN PLACE TO ENSURE A NON TOXIC WORKING ENVIRONMENT.

THE MAIN FOCUS OF RECENT ROCK CUTTER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN ON METALLURGY INCLUDING STEEL TREATMENT AND ALLOY COMPOSITIONS. TBM CUTTERS NOT ONLY HAVE TO CARRY OUT THEIR MAIN TASKS OF CUTTING OR CRUSHING MATERIALS ENCOUNTERED UP TO 400MPA, AND MOVING THEM AROUND TO REMOVAL APERTURES, THEY ALSO HAVE TO WITHSTAND ENVIRONMENTAL EXTREMES INCLUDING GROUND TEMPERATURES OF UP TO 50C, HIGH GROUNDWATER PRESSURES AND ALSO INTRUSIVE DUST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO DESIGN CUTTERS IN MATERIALS CAPABLE OF TACKLING ALL TYPES OF GROUND BUT THEY WOULD BE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE FOR NORMAL CONSTRUCTION. HOWEVER AN ATTEMPT TO SLASH COSTS BY BUYING THE CHEAPEST CUTTERS THAT WILL FIT IS UNLIKELY TO SAVE MONEY OVER THE WHOLE TUNNEL PROJECT DUE TO EARLY FAILURES AND ESPECIALLY THE COSTS INVOLVED IN UNPLANNED INTERVENTIONS FOR CUTTER CHANGES IN TERMS OF BOTH EXTRA LABOR COSTS AND PROJECT DELAYS.

VARIOUS FORMS OF TOOLS HAVE BEEN TRIED FOR MECHANICAL CUTTING OF ROCK AS PART OF THE GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF TUNNELING EQUIPMENT. MOST OF THESE HAVE INVOLVED THE LOCALIZED CRUSHING OF HARD ROCK AND SIMULTANEOUSLY RELEASING CHIPS OF ROCK FROM THE TUNNEL FACE BETWEEN THE CUTTING LINES OF THE TOOLS. THE FORCE MAY BE APPLIED PERPENDICULARLY, AS WITH DISC CUTTERS OR POINT ATTACK ROAD HEADER PICKS, OR AT AN ANGLE NEARER TO ZERO SUCH AS BY A DRAG BIT. THE ATTEMPTED DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE METHODS TO TODAYS RANGE OF CUTTERS TOOK PLACE MAINLY IN THE 19705, BUT AS IF TO SHOW THAT COMPETITIVE DEVELOPMENT IS RARELY AS LOST CAUSE, THIS PERIOD ALSO RESULTED IN THE DEVELOPMENT BY ROBBINS OF DISC CUTTERS, OF WHICH SIMILAR DESIGNS ARE NOW USED WORLDWIDE. IN THE CONTEXT OF ROCK EXCAVATION IT IS IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE CAPABILITIES OF WATER JETS BASED ON THE WATER PRESSURE DEVELOPED, WITH OR WITHOUT OTHER CUTTING ELEMENTS.

TUNNELING USING SLURRY SHIELDS WAS FIRST INTRODUCED IN SINGAPORE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF PARTS OF THE CIRCLE LINE AND DOWNTOWN LINE TWO TO COPE WITH PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING MIXED GROUND CONDITIONS OF THE BUKIT TIMAH GRANITE FORMATION. SLURRY SHIELDS WILL ALSO BE USED ON SOME SECTIONS OF THE FUTURE THOMSON LINE AND ON THE RECENTLY AWARDED SINGAPORE POWER CABLE TUNNELS. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FIVE LISTED FUNCTIONS ABOVE VARIES IN DIFFERING GROUND CONDITIONS, AND SOME CAN BECOME PRIMARY PROPERTIES OR CAN BE CONSIDERED OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE. THE DESIRED PROPERTIES FOR THE ANTICIPATED GROUND CONDITION, WERE DETERMINED IN ADVANCE OF TUNNELING, BASED INITIALLY ON THE FORESEEN GEOLOGY, BUT THEN REFINED FURTHER DURING THE TUNNELING WORKS. THE TESTS PRODUCE A NUMERICAL VALUE, BUT IN MOST CASES THE IMPORTANCE IS TO TRACK THE TREND OF CHANGE BETWEEN SUBSEQUENT TESTS AND THE OBSERVED BEHAVIOR ON THE TUNNELING PROCESS RATHER THAN FOCUS ON THE ACTUAL VALUE AND ITS UNITS.

JEAN LAUNAY OF VINCI CONSTRUCTION EXPLORES THE FUNCTION OF ROCK ARCH REINFORCEMENT AND STRESSES ON BOLTS AND SCL. WHILE THE VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL REINFORCEMENT OF SOILS HAS DEVELOPED FOLLOWING THE USE OF FULLY GROUTED BOLTS TO REINFORCE A TUNNEL CARRYING ROCK ARCH, THEY SHOULD BE DESCRIBED AS THEIR FUNCTIONALITY IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE REINFORCED ROCK ARCH AND SHOTCRETE, AND IS EASIER TO UNDERSTAND. THE THEORETICAL WORKS OF COMBARIEU SHOWED THE FUNCTIONING OF SOIL REINFORCED BY VERTICAL INCLUSIONS. THE INCLUSIONS ARE CONSIDERED AS FRICTION PILES, OR FRICTION AND END BEARING PILES. THE TRANSFER OF THE LOADS BROUGHT ABOUT BY A FILL OR A GENERAL FOUNDATION SLAB TO A SOIL REINFORCED BY INCLUSIONS OCCURS THROUGH AN ARCHING EFFECT BETWEEN THE INCLUSIONS. THE UPPER PORTION OF THE INCLUSION IS IN COMPRESSION AND IS LOADED ALONG THE TRANSFER LENGTH WHILE THE LOWER PORTION BEHAVES AS A FRICTION PILE AND RETURNS THE LOAD TO THE SURROUNDING SOIL LOCATED BETWEEN THE INCLUSIONS.

THE ADVANCEMENTS IN ENGINEERING SINCE THE ORIGINAL MIDTOWN TUNNEL WAS CONSTRUCTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 20TH CENTURY HAVE IMPROVED INSTALLATION TECHNIQUES AND MATERIALS ALIKE. OTHER THAN BOTH BEING IMMERSED TUBE, THE NEW AND OLD TUNNEL WILL HAVE VERY FEW SIMILARITIES. THE NEW TUNNELS APPROACH ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ALIGNMENT IS CLOSE TO THE EXISTING TUNNEL.

TRADITIONAL TUNNELING IS A VAGUE TERM THAT CAN LEAD TO CONFUSION. OFTEN IT REFERS TO HAND MINING REGARDLESS OF THE TUNNEL LINING, IN SOME COUNTRIES SUCH AS JAPAN IT CAN REFER TO EXCAVATION BY SEMI MECHANIZED TBM AS OPPOSED TO A CLOSED SHIELD, AND SOMETIMES IT CAN REFER TO THE MEANS OF SUPPORT DURING EXCAVATION. WITH REGARDS TO HAND MINING, IT IS NEVER USED FOR EXCAVATIONS OF SERIOUS LENGTH IN MODERN TUNNELING, PURELY FOR ECONOMICAL REASONS IN AN AGE OF MECHANIZATION. TUNNEL FINISHING WORK ON THE PERIPHERY WITH A SPADER, OR INTERFACING A NEW TUNNEL INTO AN OLD SYSTEM, IS MORE LIKELY FOR THE SPACE MIGHT PROJECTS OVER THE PAST 50 YEARS, WITH FULL PROCEDURE DETAILS LISTED BESIDE.

THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHIELD TUNNELING IN JAPAN. HITACHI ZOSEN HAVE DELIVERED 354 UNITS OF THESE MACHINES SO FAR. BUT SINCE THE 1980S, CLOSED SHIELDS HAVE RAPIDLY GAINED POPULARITY. THE MAJOR REASONS ARE THAT CLOSED TBMS HAVE HIGH SAFETY AND HIGHER EFFICIENCY COMPARED TO OPEN SHIELDS. SHINJUKU STATION IS ONE OF THE MAJOR STATIONS IN TOKYO, JAPAN. TRAFFIC, COMMERCE AND COMPANIES ARE CONCENTRATED AROUND THE STATION AND THE VICINITY IS PLAGUED BY SEVERE TRAFFIC JAM AND LACK OF A TRANSFER FUNCTION. THE TUNNEL PASSED THROUGH A SMALL SPACE. TO ENSURE AN ADEQUATE EARTH COVERING OF 6 7M, CONSIDERING THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF THE CROSS SECTION, A RECTANGULAR SHAPE FOR THE TUNNEL WAS ADOPTED. THIS SHIELD BODY HAS A RECTANGULAR SHAPE, AND EACH SIDE CURVED. THIS MACHINE DIGS A TUNNEL FACE WITH TWO LOADING MACHINES INSTALLED TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT, MAKES A SPACE, PUSHES INTO THE SPACE, AND BUILDS THE TUNNEL.

THE SHIFT TOWARDS SAFETY AND SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS IN TUNNELING TAKES PLACE ON TWO TIERS. FIRSTLY, TUNNELS OFFER A WAY TO PROTECT SENSITIVE LANDSCAPES AND TO REDUCE DISRUPTION, NOISE AND VIBRATION CAUSED BY MOTORWAYS AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE SURFACE. AS BLASTING INITIATES FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE BLAST HOLE, IT IS VITAL THAT THE BURDEN AND SPACING BETWEEN THE HOLES IN THE BLAST PLANE IS AS PLANNED. IF DRILLING IS NOT ACCURATE, THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY TO CORRECT THE BLAST BY CHARGING. THEREFORE, TO MEET THE CHALLENGE, THE OPTIMAL AND LOGICAL PLACE TO BEGIN DESIGN OF THE DRILLING PATTERN IS FROM THE END OF THE ROUND, THAT IS, IN THE BLAST PLANE. THIS APPROACH, COMBINED WITH A MODERN ACCURATE DRILLING RIG, GUARANTEES OPTIMIZED EXCAVATION RESULT. DRILL PLAN DESIGN AND THE ACCURACY OF THE DRILLING EQUIPMENT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE OVERALL CONTROL AND PRODUCTIVITY OF A TUNNEL CONSTRUCTION SITE.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE EUROPEAN URBAN WASTE WATER TREATMENT DIRECTIVE (UWWTD) IS TARGETED AT IMPROVING WATER QUALITY THROUGH REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF UNTREATED POLLUTED WATER THAT IS DISCHARGED INTO RIVER CATCHMENT AREAS. IN THE CASE OF THE THAMES AND RIVER LEE, 39MT OF DILUTED SEWAGE ARE DISCHARGED DIRECTLY INTO THE RIVER FROM COMBINED SEWER OVERFLOWS ANNUALLY. THE SYSTEM CANNOT COPE WITH THE CURRENT POPULATION, WHICH IS ONLY SET TO RISE. THE ORIGINAL SCHEME FAR SURPASSED ITS INTENDED DESIGN LIFE, SOMETHING TO CONSIDER FOR THE SCOPE OF THE EQUIVALENT MODERN DAY SCHEME. A MAJOR FACTOR TO ADD TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION REQUIRED IS THE 75M DEPTH OF THE TUNNEL AND SHAFTS. THIS IS TO ALLOW FOR A MINIMUM FLOW GRADIENT AND TO AVOID EXISTING UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS LONDON UNDERGROUND METRO LINES AND CABLE TUNNELS IN THE VICINITY.

THE BRENNER BASE TUNNEL (BBT) IS A RAILWAY LINE RUNNING THROUGH THE JPS, CONNECTING AUSTRIA AND ITALY. AT 64KM LONG IT WILL BE THE LONGEST UNDERGROUND RAILWAY CONNECTION IN THE WORLD; A PIONEERING WORK OF ENGINEERING. THE BBT WILL BE PRIMARILY FOR FREIGHT TRANSPORT, ALLOWING A SHIFT OF TRAFFIC FROM ROAD TO RAIL. PASSENGER TRAINS WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO TRAVEL THROUGH THE TUNNEL. DUE TO AN ALMOST HORIZONTAL GRADIENT, TUNNEL TRAINS WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO COPE WITH STEEP UP AND DOWN SLOPES. THE EXISTING RAIL CORRIDOR RUNNING OVER THE ALPS IS THE MOST OVERLOADED TRAFFIC CORRIDOR, AND IS CONTINUALLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT. IT HAS INCLINES OF UP TO 28MM/RN, RESULTING IN SLOW MOVEMENT OF RAIL FREIGHT. THE BBT WILL REMOVE THE STEEP INCLINES, AND SO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE VOLUME OF FREIGHT ALONG THE EUROPEAN NORTH SOUTH CORRIDOR.

THE CONTRACTOR ZINK BUILT THE UNDER STATION ELEMENT THERE AS WELL AS THE THREE UNITS REQUIRED FOR THE RIVER CROSSING. BECAUSE OF THE STRANGE SHAPE HE SAYS, THE UNITS HAVE A TENDENCY TO DEVIATE SLIGHTLY IN THE WATER AND NEED CONSTANT CORRECTION BY THE TUGBOATS. THIS WILL BE PART OF THE CHALLENGE IN THE AUTUMN WHEN THEY ARE BROUGHT FROM THE SUEZ. IT MEANS ENSURING A FIVE TUG CONFIGURATION WITH FOUR ON PULLING ROPES TO ADJUST THE COURSE AND ONE PUSHER TUG.

THE CUT AND COVER TECHNIQUE HAS BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY FOR SHALLOW TUNNELING AND DEEP TUNNEL PORTALS FOR MANY YEARS UTILIZING A HOST OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES TO RETAIN THE IN SITU SOILS IN CUT TO ALLOW THE COVER TO BE CONSTRUCTED. THESE HAVE BEEN COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES TO BORED TUNNELS AND WHERE SPACE CONSTRAINTS IN AN URBAN AREA RESTRICT THE USE OF LARGE OPEN EARTHWORK CUTTINGS. CUT AND COVER TUNNELS CAN BE CONSTRUCTED IN ONE OF TWO WAYS. THESE ARE BOTTOM UP AND TOP DOWN. BOTTOM UP IS THE SIMPLER SYSTEM, WHERE THE WALLS ARE CONSTRUCTED, EXCAVATION OF THE BOX IS CARRIED OUT, THE BASE IS INSTALLED AND THE COVER OR PERMANENT PROPS ARE CONSTRUCTED. DIAPHRAGM WALLS ARE A HEAVY DUTY WALL THAT TEND TO BE EMPLOYED WHERE A STIFFER WALL IS REQUIRED OR WHERE THE DEPTH OF WALL PRECLUDES USE OF SECANT PILED WALLS DUE TO THE VERTICALITY AND DEPTH.

THE THREE STATIONS ALONG THE CENTRAL UNDERGROUND SECTION OF THE LINE, ROKIN, VIJZELGRACHT AND CEINTUURBAAN, HAVE ALL BEEN A MAJOR CHALLENGE TO CONSTRUCT, EACH WITHIN A HUGE UNDERGROUND BOX OF DIAPHRAGM WALLS AND CONCRETE FLOORS. THEY ARE ON THE CRITICAL PATH FOR THE WORK AND DELAYS HERE HAVE BEEN THE MAIN FACTOR IN STRETCHING OUT THE PROJECT SCHEDULE. SPACE LIMITS BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS MEAN THE FINISHED STATION HERE IS 11M WIDE, JUST UNDER 13M DURING EXCAVATION. TO FIT THE LINE IN, THE TRACKS HAVE TO BE STACKED ONE OVER THE OTHER INSTEAD OF SIDE BY SIDE. THE BOX IS THEREFORE DEEPER AT 31M, IF NOT MUCH MORE THAN VIJZELGRACHT. FULL EXCAVATION DEPTH REACHED 33M. INSTALLATION WAS DONE USING AN OBSERVATIONAL METHOD WITH MODIFICATIONS TO THE INSTALLED PATTERN MADE AS MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN, AND CORE SAMPLES RETRIEVED DURING THE SUBCONTRACTORS WORK.

THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE RESULTS OF CONVERGING NOZZLES ON LOSS OF IMPULSE, A HISTORY OF THE RESEARCH, AND THE LATEST SOLUTION. THE ACTUAL THRUST CAN ONLY BE FOUND BY MEASUREMENT. ACTION AND REACTION ARE EQUAL AND OPPOSITE SO THE THRUST PROVIDED TO THE AIR CAN BE EVALUATED BY MEASURING THE REACTIVE FORCE ON THE FAN, AS SPECIFIED IN ISO 13350. ON A FULLY REVERSIBLE FAN THIS APPROACH DOES NOT GIVE ANY REAL BENEFIT. SHOULD THE DEFLECTION VANES BE ATTACHED AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE FAN ENDS, THE PRESSURE DROP COULD BE REASONABLY REDUCED BUT ONLY A PROPORTION OF THE SPREADING PLUME WOULD BE CAPTURED AND TURNED, SO AGAIN THE BENEFIT IS REDUCED. THE MOJET HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO HAVE A SOUND PHYSICAL BASIS, AND THE CFD ANALYSIS HAS SUPPORTED THIS. HOWEVER, TRUE CONFIRMATION CAN ONLY COME WITH A REAL INSTALLATION, OR IN A TEST CARRIED OUT AT A 1:1 SCALE.

THE MAIN CHALLENGES OF TUNNEL EXCAVATION HAVE PASSED AT INGULA PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT IN SOUTH AFRICA. THE UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION EFFORT HAS SWITCHED TO FINAL LINING. CONCRETING WORKS ARE ALSO UNDERWAY FOR THE POWERHOUSE CAVERN FOUNDATIONS TO HOLD FOUR MASSIVE PUMP TURBINE UNITS. BUT THE MAIN CHALLENGE WAS THE GEOLOGY FOR THE UNDERGROUND WORKS. THE GEOLOGY COMPRISES RELATIVELY WEAK SEDIMENTARY ROCK WITH SOME FAULTS AND FRACTURES IN THE COMPLEX POWERHOUSE AREA, LONG TERM CREEP BEHAVIOR AND THE RELATIVELY LOW INSITU STRESS AT DEPTH FOR THE TWIN POWER TUNNELS. THE INGULA PUMPED STORAGE SCHEME HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO WORK UNDER A RATED HEAD OF 441 M BETWEEN TWO RESERVOIRS, THE UPPER BEDFORD AND LOWER BRAMHOEK, BOTH NEW IMPOUNDED WATER BODES AND POSITIONED APPROXIMATELY 6 KM APART. THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM WILL HOLD 21GWH, OR ALMOST 16 HOURS OF ENERGY GENERATION, ALTHOUGH IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT 20 HOURS OF PUMPING TO CHARGE THE SYSTEM.

THE REQUIREMENT TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF A SECTION OF ROAD TUNNEL FIRST EMERGED AT THE START OF THE 1990S, DURING A STUDY TO WIDEN A 40KM SECTION OF THE AL MILAN NAPLES MOTORWAY BETWEEN ORTE AND FIANO ROMANO, NEAR ROME, ITALY. THE DESIGN CONCEPT OF THIS PROJECT WAS DEVELOPED BY PIETRO LUNARDI DURING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BALDO DEGLI UBALDI SINGLE VAULT UNDERGROUND STATION FOR THE ROCKSOIL DESIGNED EXTENSION OF LINE A OF THE ROME METRO BETWEEN OTTAVIANO AND BATTISTINI STATIONS. ACTIVE ARCH LINING REFERS TO A LINING THAT PRODUCES IMMEDIATE CONFINEMENT OF THE SURROUNDING GROUND, WITHOUT WAITING FOR IT TO DEFORM AND PUSH DOWN ON THE EXTRADOS. A LINING OF THIS TYPE IS FORMED BY ERECTING AN ARCH OF PREFABRICATED REINFORCED CONCRETE SEGMENTS. THIS IS IMMEDIATELY RENDERED A LOAD BEARING STRUCTURE BY TWO OPPOSING FLAT JACKS INSERTED IN THE KEY SEGMENTS WHICH ARTIFICIALLY APPLY THE AXIAL COMPRESSIVE STRESS NEEDED TO CONTRAST THE LOADS TO BE BORN.

PASSIVE FIRE PROTECTION IS AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT FOR ANY TYPE OF TRANSPORT TUNNEL. WHILE TUNNELS MAKE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO MODERN TRANSPORT NETWORKS, THEY ALSO POSE SOME SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING THEM FROM FIRE. YET THAT PROTECTION IS AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT, GIVEN THAT THE LIMITED SCOPE FOR ESCAPE AND A LACK OF EASY ACCESS MEANS THAT A MAJOR TUNNEL BLAZE CAN HAVE POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS RESULTS. PASSIVE FIRE PROTECTION WILL SLOW THE SPREAD OF FIRE AND LIMIT THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY HIGH TEMPERATURES, THUS PROVIDING MORE TIME FOR OCCUPANTS TO ESCAPE. THEY INHIBIT THE ESCALATION OF A FIRE AND CAN ALSO BE USED TO PROTECT ELEMENTS OF AN ACTIVE SYSTEM SUCH AS POWER SUPPLIES OR PIPE WORK. MANY PASSIVE MEASURES ALSO OFFER THERMAL AND ACOUSTIC INSULATION BENEFITS, WHICH MAKES THEM EVEN MORE ATTRACTIVE.

THE MATERIALS AND METHODS COLLECTIVELY DESCRIBED AS PASSIVE FIRE PROTECTION FOR TUNNELS ARE OF VARIED TYPES AND MIXED BENEFITS. THE IMPORTANCE OF PASSIVE FIRE PROTECTION IS OFTEN NOT JUST A MATTER OF REDUCING RECOVERY COSTS BY PROTECTING THE TUNNEL STRUCTURE. MOST TYPES ONLY COME INTO PLAY AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES WHEN LIFE IN THE TUNNEL IS, HOPEFULLY, SAVED. ANOTHER APPROACH IN CREATING FIREPROOFING BARRIERS IS SPRAYING FIRE RESISTANT MATERIAL ONTO THE SURFACE TO BE PROTECTED. ADVANTAGES INCLUDE A CLOSE FIT TO THE STRUCTURE OR SERVICE LINES TO BE PROTECTED. USING ADVANCED ROBOTIC APPLICATORS SUCH AS THE MEYCOS ROBOJET, APPLYING THE CORRECT THICKNESS OF LINING IN THE CORRECT PLACES CAN ALSO SAVE COSTS AND ACHIEVES TOLERANCES THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE WITH MANUALLY APPLIED PRODUCTS. APPLICATION RATES AT 150 250M2 PER HOUR DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIED THICKNESS.

LIGHTING IS A KEY FACTOR IN MINIMIZING TRANSPORT TUNNEL OPERATING COSTS WHILST MAINTAINING OR IMPROVING SAFETY. NEW DESIGNS OF LOW ENERGY, LOW MAINTENANCE LUMINAIRES PROMISE MUCH, BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS HOW THEY ARE INSTALLED AND USED. SITECO BELEUCHTUNDTECHNIK, AN OSRAM BUSINESS INVOLVED IN TUNNEL LIGHTING DESIGN AND INSTALLATION, HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE FIRST TUNNEL INSTALLATIONS OF LED LUMINAIRES IN GERMANY AND ELSEWHERE IN CENTRAL EUROPE, BUT ALSO SUPPLIES EARLIER TYPES OF LUMINAIRES AS REQUIRED BY BOTH THE TUNNEL CONDITIONS AND OPERATORS. THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF THE STAINLESS STEEL CASE IS ENHANCED WITH SAFETY GLASS AND AN ADDITIONAL PROTECTIVE COATING. THE LUMINAIRES HAVE AN 1P66 PROTECTION RATING AGAINST FOREIGN MATTER AND IMPACT.

THE LIGHTING INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE, INCLUDING SMALL SPECIALIST SECTORS SUCH AS TUNNELS, HAS BEEN UNDERGOING GREAT CHANGES IN THE LAST DECADE. CHANGES IN LIGHT SOURCE TECHNOLOGY, MORE PRODUCT SUPPLIERS, LOW ENERGY AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS, AND EVEN THE DESIGN OF LONGER AND WIDER TUNNELS ARE THE LEADING FACTORS IN A SOMETIMES CONFUSING ARRAY OF PROCUREMENT CONSIDERATIONS. A MAJOR CHARACTERISTIC OF THE LIGHTING MARKET IS THE HUGE NUMBER OF VERY SIMILAR LED LUMINARIES BEING MADE AVAILABLE FROM MANY DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS IN ASIA. THESE ARE CHIEFLY LOCATED IN CHINA BUT ALSO EMANATE FROM KOREA, TAIWAN, THE PHILIPPINES, THAILAND AND OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE MARKETS ALSO HAVE VARYING LEVELS OF SUPPLIER SERVICE SUPPORT AVAILABLE.

THE APPLICATION OF THE REFLECTIVE PANELS IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A HIGHER DEGREE OF AMBIENCE IN THE TUNNEL, IMPROVING THE VISUAL PERFORMANCE OF DRIVERS. WITH REFLECTIVE WALLS THE COMFORT LEVEL OF THE DRIVER IS IMPROVED, AS THE DARK TUNNELING EFFECT IS REDUCED. THE MEASUREMENT TOOL USED WOULD BE THE SAME LUMINANCE METER THAT WAS BEING USED TO TEST AND COMMISSION THE CARRIAGEWAY LUMINANCE VALUES. MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN FOR LUMINANCE ON BARRIER SURFACE ADJACENT TO VEHICLE, CARRIAGEWAY IN FRONT OF VEHICLE, BRIGHT SPOTS ON WALL ADJACENT TO VEHICLE AND THE HEADLAMPS IN LOW AND HIGH BEAM. THE VEHICLE WAS THEN MOVED 10M CLOSER TO OBSERVER POSITION AND THE MEASUREMENTS TAKEN AGAIN.

PREPARATION OF THE SITE INCLUDED SOME DEMOLITION AND THE CREATION OF A SUITABLE LEVEL SURFACE BY RETAINED BACKFILLING, AND SO CREATING ENOUGH STORAGE SPACE. THE INITIAL LONDON POWER TUNNELS PROJECT HAS SEVERAL STRATEGIC PURPOSES FOR NATIONAL GRID. FIRSTLY IT WILL RENEW THE AGING MAIN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY ROUTES IN THE CAPITAL, REPLACING CABLES OF OLD DESIGN THAT ARE NOW APPROACHING THE END OF THEIR LIFE. SECONDLY IT WILL PROVIDE FOR THE CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING POWER NEEDS OF THE CONURBATION.

THE ROPES FOR THIS DO NOT GO DOWN THE FULL DEPTH OF THE MINE, SO WERE NO GOOD FOR THE RESCUE FROM THE DEEP LEVELS. THE 8.5KM LONG RAMP USED TO ACCESS THE MINE FACE HAD COMPLETELY FAILED.

THE BASIC CONCEPT OF EFFECTS OF TUNNELING ON BUILDINGS DESCRIBES THE TRANSVERSE SETTLEMENT TROUGH CAUSED. THE TROUGH CONFORMS TO A CLASSICAL GAUSSIAN EQUATION THAT CAN BE DERIVED FROM A FUNDAMENTAL PARAMETER IN SETTLEMENT ASSESSMENTS, THE VOLUME LOSS. A VOLUME LOSS OF AROUND ONE PER CENT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN MANY CASES IN LONDON CLAY. A NUMBER OF FACTORS CONTROL VOLUME LOSS, BUT CONTROLLING THE FACE PRESSURE IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN CONTROLLING GROUND MOVEMENT. MIXED GROUND CONDITIONS CAN GIVE RISE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FACE PRESSURE BUT LONDON CLAY IS MORE UNIFORM AND IT IS EASIER TO KEEP FACE PRESSURES BROADLY CONSTANT. CENTRIFUGE MODELING TESTS HAVE EXAMINED THE MODIFICATION FACTOR IN SOME DETAIL. STRUCTURES OF DIFFERENT STIFFNESS AND TUNNELS AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS AND POSITIONS IN RELATION TO THE STRUCTURE WERE IDEALIZED. IF EXTRACTING FLUID FROM THE ANNULUS OF THE MODELED TUNNEL ACCURATELY CONTROLS VOLUME LOSSES, GREENFIELD SETTLEMENT TROUGHS CAN BE PRODUCED WHICH, WITH THE ADDITION OF A FLEXIBLE BUILDING, ARE SIMILAR.

THE PLANNING OF A TUNNELING PROJECT STARTS WITH THE GROUND. IN RENOVATION WORK, THE GROUND MAY PLAY A PART, BUT THE MAIN CONSIDERATION IS THE STATE OF THE EXISTING UNDERGROUND STRUCTURE AND WHETHER IT CAN BE MADE TO MEET CHANGING NEEDS AND MODERN STANDARDS. IN MANY CIRCUMSTANCES IT MAY BE TEMPTING TO SOLVE SUCH PROBLEMS BY RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE, BUT READILY AVAILABLE, NEW BUILD. INDEED THIS MAY BE THE ONLY ADEQUATE SOLUTION, BUT WITH EXPERIENCE AND INNOVATIVE THINKING, THE PROBLEMS OF DETERIORATING OR INADEQUATE TUNNELS CAN BE RESOLVED MORE ECONOMICALLY. SEWERS CAN BE A MAJOR RENOVATION NEED, ESPECIALLY IN OLDER URBAN AREAS WHERE THE ASSET MAY WELL BE OVER A CENTURY OLD AND BRICK BUILT. IN MORE RECENTLY DEVELOPED SEWERAGE SYSTEMS, OFTEN IN TROPICAL OR SUB TROPICAL CLIMATES, THE HIGH AMBIENT TEMPERATURES CAN INCREASE CORROSION RATES OF A CONCRETE FABRIC, NECESSITATING LINING WITH A LESS CORRODIBLE MATERIALS, SUCH AS GLASS FIBER REINFORCED PLASTIC (GRP), OR REPLACEMENT.

THE EXPRESSION SQUEEZING GROUND IS COMMONLY USED WITH REFERENCE TO LARGE DEFORMATIONS OF THE OPENING AFTER EXCAVATION. IF AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO HINDER THE GROUND DEFORMATIONS, A HIGH GROUND PRESSURE MAY DEVELOP UPON THE TUNNEL SUPPORT ENDANGERING ITS STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY. THE SPACE AVAILABLE FOR GROUND DEFORMATIONS IN TBM TUNNELING IS VERY LIMITED, DUE TO THE FIXED GEOMETRY AND THE LIMITED FLEXIBILITY OF THE TUNNELING EQUIPMENT (TBM AND BACK UP). THE PERFORMANCE OF A TBM IS THE RESULT OF A COMPLEX INTERACTION BETWEEN THE MAIN SYSTEM COMPONENTS GROUND, TUNNELING EQUIPMENT (TBM AND BACK UP) AND TUNNEL SUPPORT. THE ADVANCE RATE INFLUENCES THIS INTERACTION TOO AND IS NOT ONLY A RESULT OF IT. IN ORDER TO RESUME TBM OPERATION, THE THRUSTING SYSTEM MUST BE ABLE TO COPE WITH THE FORCES ACTING UPON THE CUTTER HEAD AND THE SHIELD. IN ORDER TO MOVE THE TBM FORWARD, THE EFFECTIVE AVAILABLE THRUST FORCE MUST BE HIGHER THAN THE FRICTIONAL RESISTANCE (STATIC FRICTION).

EEGF IS THE SPECIFIC ENERGY USED TO ROTATE THE CUTTERHEAD AGAINST THE TERRAIN PREVIOUSLY INDENTED BY THE TBM CUTTER. IN NORMAL CONDITIONS, EEGF ACCOUNTS FOR 31 41 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL SPECIFIC ENERGY OF EXCAVATION SEE. CONTRARY TO THE EEGR, THE HIGHER VALUES OF EEGF CORRESPOND TO MUCH LOWER RATINGS OF RMR. IN THE OPPOSITE CASE, WHEN THE ROCK MASS LOSES ITS STRENGTH AND BECOMES UNSTABLE AT THE TUNNEL FACE, THE CUTTERS HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY IN BEING EFFECTIVE, THEN THE OTHER COMPONENT EEGF AMOUNTS TO 100 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL ENERGY. THE PARAMETERS CONTROLLING THE PROGRESS OF A TBM, PROVIDE INFORMATION ON HOW THE MACHINE PROGRESSES IN REAL TIME; THUS DEVELOPING VITAL DATA WHICH CAN BE USED AS A GUIDE TO OPTIMIZE TBM ADVANCE.

POPULAR ATTENTION TO THE COMPLEXITIES AND INCREASING SIZE OF MODERN TBMS OFTEN LEADS TO OVERLOOKING THE INCREASING NUMBER OF FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE TO BE PERFORMED WITH EQUIPMENT JUST BEHIND THE CUTTERHEAD AND SHIELD. THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE WAS 600M LONG AND WEIGHED NEARLY 2,000T. IN ADDITION TO MORE NORMAL TBM BACK UP DUTIES, THE WORMS FUNCTION IS TO RECYCLE ROCK SPOIL INTO TUNNEL LINING. LIKE THE WORM, EACH MSD. WHILST EACH TBM BACK UP SYSTEM TENDS TO BE UNIQUE AS DEMANDED BY THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROJECT, THE DIAMETER OF THE TUNNEL IS A COMMON LIMITING PARAMETER FOR ALL THE EQUIPMENT THAT HAS TO BE CARRIED. ROBBINS SENIOR DESIGNER MIKE ANDERSON COMPARES THE SITUATION TO THAT OF MAKING A SAUSAGE. ONE OF THE TRICKIEST PLACES IN ANY TUNNELING OPERATION, ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE BACK UP AREA, IS THE INVERT.

SELECTION OF EXCAVATION METHOD IS ONE OF THE MOST COMPLICATED AND VITAL DECISIONS IN TUNNEL CONSTRUCTION PLANNING. DEVELOPMENTS OVER RECENT YEARS IN TUNNEL EXCAVATION METHODS HAVE GREATLY INCREASED THE CAPABILITIES OF TUNNELING OVERALL, BUT THEY HAVE RARELY SIMPLIFIED CHOICE, DEPENDING ON PROJECT CONDITIONS. THE BROAD RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES WITHIN CONVENTIONAL EXCAVATION INCLUDES HYDRAULIC EXCAVATORS AND HAMMERS. THE SECOND PART WILL COVER SOME OF THE FACTORS INVOLVED IN CHOOSING THE TBM METHOD, AND THE CHOICE OF TBM TYPE, AND TRY TO DRAW SOME CONCLUSIONS. CONTINUOUS MECHANICAL EXCAVATION, AS WITH TBMS OR ROADHEADERS, SHOULD PRODUCE RELATIVELY LOW VIBRATION.

FATHI TARADA, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF MOSEN, DISCUSSES WHETHER SMOKE VENTILATION IS REQUIRED FOR TUNNELS UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN LIGHT OF RECENT DANGEROUS INCIDENTS. IN THE UK, A SERIOUS FIRE OCCURRED IN THE CHANNEL TUNNEL RAIL LINKS (CTRL) THAMES TUNNEL ON 16 AUGUST 2005. TWO CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WERE KILLED IN A FIRE THAT BROKE OUT IN A DIESEL LOCOMOTIVE DRAWING A CONSTRUCTION TRAIN SOUTH THROUGH THE 2.5KM LONG, 8.15M OD EASTERN BORE OF THE TUNNEL. AS EVIDENCED BY THE INCIDENTS IN THE NIAGARA RIVER DIVERSION TUNNEL, VEGA DEL CIEGO TUNNEL, CTRL THAMES TUNNEL AND OTHERS, FIRES CAN GENERATE A SIGNIFICANT VOLUME OF SMOKE, EVEN WITH RELATIVELY LOW HEAT RELEASE RATES THAT DO NOT THREATEN THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE TUNNEL LININGS. ALTHOUGH THE PROVISION OF EMERGENCY VENTILATION IS NOT SPECIFIED BY THE RELEVANT TUNNELING STANDARDS, THE NUMBER OF RECENT TUNNEL FIRES AND EXPLOSIONS AS WELL AS THEIR RESULTING CASUALTIES SHOULD GIVE US REASON TO RECONSIDER.

SINCE THE UNDERLYING DATA IS RELATIVELY OLD AND MOSTLY FROM TUNNELS WITH DIAMETERS <6.0 7.0 M, THIS MATERIAL IS NO LONGER UP TO DATE. ALSO, THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS SINCE 1990 IN TBM TECHNOLOGY, IN PARTICULAR AS FAR AS CUTTERS ARE CONCERNED (MATERIAL, SHAPE, AND DIAMETER OF DISKS). THE CHANGED SITUATION HAS MOTIVATED A RESEARCH GROUP CONSISTING OF FIVE UNIVERSITY INSTITUTES FROM THE ALPINE REGION TO PICK UP THE TOPIC OF THE PREDICTION OF PENETRATION RATE AND CUTTER WEAR, WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF DEVELOPING A COMPLETELY NEW OR IMPROVED PREDICTION MODEL. HOWEVER, PENETRATION RATE IS ONLY ONE ALTHOUGH THE FIRST AND MAJORPARAMETER TO CALCULATE ADVANCE RATE. THE PREDICTION OF ADVANCE RATE IS ESSENTIALLY A TASK OF CONSTRUCTION PLANNING, IN WHICH ASPECTS OF MACHINE TECHNOLOGY, OPERATION, ORGANISATION AND LOGISTICS MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. A SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD CALCULATION IS INSUFFICIENT FOR DOING THIS: CALCULATION MUST HAPPEN IN ITERATIVE STEPS. ON THE BASIS OF A DOCTORAL THESIS ACCEPTED IN 2004 AT THE UNIVERSITY OF INNSBRUCK, AN ENGINEERING FIRM SPECIALISING IN CONSTRUCTION PLANNING AND ECONOMICS 11 HAS DEVELOPED THE SOFTWARE SIMTUNNEL PRO 2.0 MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO CALCULATE ADVANCE RATE IN A COMPREHENSIBLE WAY, TAKING ALL CONCEIVABLE INFLUENCES AND BASIC CONDITIONS INTO ACCOUNT.

THE INCREASING DEMANDS ON VENTILATION ARE NOT ONLY AFFECTING THE DESIGN OF NEW TUNNELS BUT ALSO CREATING A MAJOR MARKET IN REFURBISHMENT. A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT IN ROAD TUNNEL VENTILATION HAS BEEN JET FANS. THESE WORK MAINLY BY INDUCING AIRFLOW AROUND THEM, MULTIPLYING THE AIR ACTUALLY PASSED THROUGH EACH FAN. THE WIDE RANGE OF AXIAL AND JET FANS AVAILABLE FROM HOWDEN VENTILATOREN FEATURES CORROSION PROTECTION AND FLAMEPROOF MOTORS, WITH AUTO VARIABLE PITCH OR VARIABLE SPEED DRIVES, AND POTENTIAL FOR UP TO 100 PER CENT REVERSE FLOW. THE BANANA JET, AVAILABLE FROM WITT & SOHN OF GERMANY, IMPROVES ON INSTALLATION EFFICIENCY BY HAVING A HOUSING THAT DIRECTS THE JET TOWARDS THE TUNNEL CENTRELINE AT AN ANGLE OF SEVEN DEGREES INSTEAD OF A STRAIGHT TUBE. CONNOLS AIR OF SINGAPORE SUPPLIES THE OLS SD60 SMOKE DAMPERS PARTICULARLY FOR METRO SYSTEMS. STAINLESS STEEL MOVING PARTS ARE EMPLOYED TO PREVENT SEIZURE, WITHIN A GALVANIZED STEEL STRUCTURE.

TWO COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (CFD) FIRE SIMULATION ANALYSES WAS CARRIED OUT BY TAKING THE INDUSTRY STANDARD APPROACH AND THE BEST PRACTICE APPROACH, FOR AN IMPROVED APPROACH TO JET FAN PERFORMING MODELING. THE FIRE IS LOCATED 260M DOWNSTREAM OF THE MODEL INLET, WHICH IS SUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE A FULLY DEVELOPED FLOW FIELD AT THE FIRE LOCATION. THE RESULTS FROM THE SIMULATION BY THE INDUSTRY STANDARD APPROACH SHOW THE VELOCITY MAGNITUDE IN A CROSS SECTION HALFWAY BETWEEN A PAIR OF FANS AND THE EXTENT OF THE SMOKE SPREADING. THE RESULTS FROM THE SIMULATION FROM THE BEST PRACTICE APPROACH SUGGEST THAT THE SPREADING RATE OF THE JET MOMENTUM IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE A CONSISTENT, DOWN TUNNEL VENTILATION FLOW. THE DIFFERENCE IS CAUSED BY THE FLAWS OF THE INDUSTRY STANDARD APPROACH, WHICH LEADS TO UNTRUE PREDICTIONS OF THE VENTILATION FLOW FIELD FOR CASES WHERE THE PREDICTION OF THE JET SPREADING RATE IS CRITICAL TO THE VENTILATION SYSTEM PERFORMANCE.

CHANGE IS AN ASPECT OF PROJECT RISK, WHICH CAN BE EFFECTIVELY MANAGED AND MITIGATED THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT CYCLE WHEN INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES ARE APPLIED. TECHNICALLY, CHANGE MAY RESULT FROM A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS THAT MODIFY THE SCOPE, IMPLEMENTATION OR RISK PROFILE OF A PROJECT, WITH CONSEQUENTIAL IMPACTS ON COST AND PROGRAM. FOR MAJOR UNDERGROUND PROJECTS, PARTICULARLY IN URBAN AREAS, EARLY CONSULTATION WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS IS IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CHANGES IN LATER STAGES OF THE PROJECT. THE USE OF GEOTECHNICAL BASELINE REPORTS (GBR) IS A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT THAT PROVIDES A FIXED CONTRACTUAL BASELINE FOR GROUND CONDITIONS. THE APPLICATION OF INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICE IN THE PRE CONSTRUCTION STAGES OF A PROJECT WILL HELP MINIMIZE CHANGE.

K. G. HOLTER AND H. O. HOGNESTAD OF BASF MEYCO FOCUS ON THE USE OF MODERN COST EFFECTIVE METHODS AND MATERIAL TECHNOLOGY FOR PRE INJECTIONS IN SHALLOW TUNNELS. THE BASIC IDEA OF PRE INJECTION IS TO TREAT THE GROUND PRIOR TO THE EXCAVATION BY INJECTING A GROUT INTO THE GROUND THROUGH DRILLHOLES AND PUMPING AT PRESSURE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND A PRE INJECTION SCHEME IN TUNNELING AS A SEQUENCE OF DECISIONS MADE AT SEVERAL STAGES IN THE INJECTION CYCLE. MANAGEMENT OF THE INJECTION WORKS IS THEREFORE A CRUCIAL FACTOR IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST EFFECTIVENESS. THE PROCESS OF BLEEDING, IN WHICH THE CEMENT GRAINS SEPARATE FROM THE GROUT MIX AND CLOG THE ENTRANCES TO THE FINE JOINTS, DOES NOT OCCUR WITH A STABLE GROUT MIX. THE HEADRACE TUNNEL FOR THE MANERI BHALI HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECT PHASE 2 UNDERPASSES A VALLEY WITH LOW ROCK COVER. THE TUNNEL WAS EXCAVATED BY DRILL AND BLAST AND SUPPORTED BY STEEL SETS AND LAGGING WITH CONCRETE BACKFILL.

JOHN GREENHALGH OF BEKAERT LOOKS AT THE INCREASING USE OF STEEL FIBER CONCRETE IN UK TUNNELS OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS. IN THE UK THE FIRST STEEL FIBRE SEGMENTALLY LINED TUNNEL WAS THE 1.4KM BAGGAGE TUNNEL AT LONDON HEATHROW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN 1995. THIS WAS A DESIGN AND BUILD PROJECT BY MILLER TUNNELING, NOW MORGAN SINDALL, IN WHICH THE TRADITIONAL REINFORCEMENT CAGE WAS COMPLETELY REMOVED AND DRAMIX STEEL FIBERS USED. ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS WAS THE POTENTIAL OF TRAIN DERAILING AND IMPACTING THE NEW TUNNEL LINING, SO IT WAS DECIDED THAT A LINING INCORPORATING STEEL FIBERS WITH TRADITIONAL REINFORCEMENT WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION. MANY PROJECTS FOLLOWED IN THE 1990S, MAINLY IN THE UTILITY SECTOR, AND INTO THE NEW MILLENNIUM WITH TWO MAJOR PROJECTS THE TUNNELING WORKS FOR THE NEW HEATHROW TERMINAL 5 (T5 HEX) AND THE CHANNEL TUNNEL RAIL PART 2 (CTRL).

MAURICE JONES REPORTS ON VARIOUS TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS CURRENTLY TAKING PLACE IN PIPE AND STRUCTURE JACKING. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AACHEN RWTH, HERRENKNECHT HAS BEEN DEVELOPING A PIPE JOINT SENSING AND MONITORING SYSTEM CALLED THE ONLINE LOAD CONTROL (OLC). IT HAS ALREADY BEEN USED IN SOME PIPE JACKING APPLICATIONS INCLUDING THE MAERZENBACH HYDROPOWER SCHEME IN THE AUSTRIAN ALPS. ANOTHER RECENT DEVELOPMENT BY HERRENKNECHT COMBINES FEATURES OF PIPE JACKING WITH HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONAL DRILLING RIGS. THE PIPE THRUSTER ASSISTS THE INSTALLATION OF CONTINUOUS STEEL PIPELINES THAT, WITH CONVENTIONAL DIRECTIONAL DRILLING, WOULD RELY MAINLY ON THE PULLBACK FORCE AVAILABLE FROM THE DRILLING RIG. THE INSTALLATION OF RELATIVELY LARGE DIMENSION, OFTEN RECTANGULAR SECTION, STRUCTURES SUCH AS CULVERTS, UNDERPASSES AND SUBWAYS UNDER SURFACE OBSTRUCTIONS SUCH AS ROADS AND RAILWAYS, WHICH MAY REMAIN ACTIVE, IS SOMETHING OF A NICHE PURSUIT WITHIN THE JACKING WORLD. JACKED STRUCTURES POINTS OUT THAT JACKING CAN BE USED TO CREATE IRREGULAR OPENINGS AS WELL AS THE MORE USUAL REGULAR SECTIONS IN LARGE DIMENSIONS.

MAURICE JONES REPORTS ON THE COMPLETION OF AN ALTERNATIVE BY PASS TUNNEL THAT WAS DECIDED UPON AS PART OF THE WATER SUPPLY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (WSIP) UNDERTAKEN BY THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION (SFPUC). THE ALTERNATIVE BY PASS WAS DECIDED UPON BECAUSE THE EXISTING CRYSTAL SPRINGS BY PASS PIPELINE CAN BE AFFECTED BY SEISMIC ACTIVITY. IN ADDITION TO ITS CRITICAL PLACE IN THE WSIP WITH SEISMIC UPGRADING, THERE WAS ADDITIONAL MOTIVATION FOR THE MOVE TO REPLACE THE EXISTING CRYSTAL SPRINGS BYPASS PIPELINE. THE NEW TUNNEL IS 1280M LONG AND 2.44M FINISHED DIAMETER WITH A WELDED STEEL LINER, AND IS DUE FOR COMPLETION IN SPRING NEXT YEAR. THE MIX WAS DESIGNED AND PLACED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT SUPPORT FOR THE PIPE ONCE CURED, BUT TO AVOID TOO MUCH FLOTATION FORCE TENDING TO LIFT THE PIPE.

BENOIT DE RIVAZ, GLOBAL TUNNELING MANAGER OF BEKAERT PRESENTS HIS OPINIONS AND SUPPORTING EVIDENCE ON CHOOSING THE CORRECT FIBERS FOR REINFORCING CONCRETE IN UNDERGROUND APPLICATIONS. THE REINFORCING ABILITY OF A FIBER DEPENDS ON THE ANCHORAGE OF THE FIBER INTO THE CONCRETE, THE TENSILE STRENGTH AND ITS YOUNGS MODULUS. METALLIC FIBERS HAVE A NEUTRAL TO POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE FIRE RESISTANCE OF STRUCTURES. DUE TO A DECREASED SPALLING EFFECT, A STRUCTURE IN METAL FIBROUS CONCRETE BEHAVES RATHER BETTER IN THE PRESENCE OF FIRE THAN A MESH REINFORCED STRUCTURE FOR SEGMENTAL LINING, ACCORDING TO TUNNELING SPECIALISTS. EUROPEAN STANDARD 14721 SPECIFIES TWO METHODS OF MEASURING THE FIBER CONTENT OF METALLIC FIBER CONCRETE. THE TEST PLATE USUALLY USED IS DESIGNED TO DETERMINE THE ENERGY ABSORBED FROM THE LOAD/DEFLECTION CURVE. FIBER CONCRETE IS WELL KNOWN FOR ITS DUCTILITY. THE EFFECT OF FIBERS IS A COMBINATION OF REINFORCEMENT AND NETWORKING.

CONSTRUCTION OF THE HALLANDSAS RAILWAY TUNNELS IN WESTERN SWEDEN HAS OFTEN BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE MOST DIFFICULT TUNNELING PROJECT IN THE WORLD. MANY READERS WOULD PROBABLY WANT TO ARGUE THAT POINT BUT THERE IS NO DISPUTING HOW TRICKY IT HAS BEEN OVER THE 18 YEARS SINCE CONSTRUCTION BEGAN. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SCANDINAVIAN LINK ROUTE, WHICH THE HALLANDSAS RIDGE LIES ACROSS, WILL JOIN OSLO TO SWEDEN, AND, THROUGH THE ORESUND LINK, DENMARK, HAMBURP AND THE REST OF NORTHERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE. AT 10KM WIDE AND TENS OF KILOMETERS LONG, THE HALLANDSAS RIDGE IS PROMINENT ABOVE THE FLAT LANDSCAPE OF SOUTHWEST SWEDEN. THE TBM CHOSEN WAS A SPECIAL FORM OF HENENKNECHT MIXSHIELD NAMED ASA THAT CAN OPERATE IN OPEN MODE OR CLOSED SLURRY SHIELD MODE. GROUTING IS NECESSARY IN MANY PARTS OF THE TUNNELS FOR WATER CONTROL, BUT ONLY INFREQUENTLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF GENERAL GROUND CONSOLIDATION, DESPITE THE BROKEN ROCK.

THE GREATEST CHALLENGE FOR TUNNELERS IS GOING TO BE FACED ON LINE 2 OF THE SCHEME, WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE WORKS ARE UNDERGROUND. THE TUNNELS PROPOSED ALIGNMENT IS BASED ON FINDINGS FROM A FEASIBILITY STUDY CARRIED OUT BY GERMAN CONSULTANTS TEWET IN 2003, AND UPDATED IN 2005. THE HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT IS QUITE CONSTRAINED DUE TO LOCATIONS OF THE STATIONS WITHIN THE NARROW STREETS TYPICAL TO THE AREA, AND THE NEED TO AVOID BUILDING FOUNDATIONS.

TUTOR SALIBA IS PLANNING TO EXCAVATE THE 1,033M LONG TUNNEL TUBE THROUGH WEAK, SEDIMENTARY ROCK AFTER WINNING THE $2 14.8M CONTRACT TO BUILD THE FOURTH BORE OF THE CALDECOTT TUNNEL. SITUATED IN THE BAY AREA OF SAN FRANCISCO, ON THE BORDER OF ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTIES, THE CALDECOTT TUNNEL WAS OPENED IN THE 1930S AS A TWIN BORE ROUTE. COMMUTER TRAFFIC TO AND FROM THE BAY AREA IS EFFECTIVELY THROTTLED WITH THE EIGHT LANES OF THE SR24 REDUCED TO SIX AT THE CALDECOTT TUNNEL. TUTOR SALIBA SUBMITTED THE LOWEST OF FOUR BIDS, WHICH WERE OPENED IN SEPTEMBER. THE PROXIMITY OF NEIGHBOURS PREVENTED DRILL AND BLAST DURING NIGHT SHIFTS AND MUCH OF THE DAY, AND TRAFFIC FLOWS IN LIVE TUNNELS ALSO RESTRICT THE WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY. EXCAVATION SUPPORT WILL MAINLY BE WITH SHOTCRETE, ROCK BOLTS AND RIBS. FOLLOWING INSTALLATION OF A WATERPROOF LINER A FURTHER LAYER OF SHOTCRETE WILL BE PLACED.

THE BELFAST SEWERS PROJECT BY NORTHERN IRELAND WATER WILL PROVIDE BELFAST WITH A MODERN SEWERAGE SYSTEM DESIGNED TO MANAGE ITS PRESENT AND FUTURE NEEDS. THE PROJECT WAS DESIGNED BY THE MORGAN EST FARRENS JOINT VENTURE (JV). THE TUNNELS WERE BORED USING A SOFT GROUND ADAPTED EPBM (EARTH PRESSURE BALANCE MACHINES), A MACHINE THAT PRODUCED A PREDICTABLE SURFACE IMPACT SUPPLIED BY LOVAT. THE WORK WAS MUCH MORE MECHANIZED USING HIGH ANGLE CONVEYOR (HAC) IN THE 2.4M DIAMETER SECTION USING A HIGH ALTITUDE CONVEYOR FOR THE MUCK REMOVAL. THE HAC PROVED A GREAT SUCCESS ON THIS PROJECT COPING WITH SANDY SOUP, GRAVEL, CLAY, SANDSTONE AND BLOCKS OF DOLERITE. COMPRESSED AIR WAS USED SEVERAL TIMES ON THE PROJECT, ONCE FOR DAMAGE TO THE ARTICULATION IN THE 4M DIAMETER MACHINE AND ONCE TO A DAMAGED SCREW IN THE 2.4M DIAMETER MACHINE. THE PROJECT WAS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY DESPITE TREMENDOUS VARIETY AND UNRELIABILITY OF THE GEOLOGY IN THE REGION.

ANOTHER FACTOR GREATLY AFFECTING THE CHOICE OF CUTTERS IS THE DIAMETER OF THE TUNNEL AND TBM. THIS IS BECAUSE THE GAUGE AND OTHER OUTER CUTTERS HAVE TO TRAVEL GREAT DISTANCES WHILE THOSE NEARER THE CENTREX TRAVEL LESS BUT ARE SUBJECT TO HIGHER AXIAL LOADING AND BEARING FORCES.

SKELHORN, S., MCNALLY CONSTRUCTION INC.; MCNALLY, L., MCNALLY CONSTRUCTION INC.	TUNNELING REQUIRES VARIOUS SUPPORT SYSTEMS SUCH AS PRECAST SEGMENTAL LINER RINGS TO DEAL WITH CHALLENGING CONDITIONS. DESIGNERS AND CONTRACTORS STARTED EXPERIMENTING WITH TRAPEZOIDAL SEGMENTS IN THE EARLY 1980S DUE TO THE NEED TO IMPROVE WATER TIGHTNESS OF THE LINING AND THE SUBSTITUTION OF RUBBER GASKETS FOR PREVIOUSLY USED HYDROPHILIC GASKETS. THE ADVANCEMENT IN THE SYSTEMS OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL PROJECTS LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODEM UNIVERSAL RING USED TODAY. MODERN TAPERED SEGMENTAL RINGS HAVE MITIGATED MANY OF THE EARLY ISSUES, WHICH USUALLY COMPRISE TWO TRAPEZOIDAL KEY SEGMENTS AND NUMEROUS RHOMBOID SIDE SEGMENTS TO MAKE THE FULL RING. DECIDING THE RING WIDTH IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR TO CONSIDER WHEN SELECTING THE OPTIMUM RING CONFIGURATION AS TUNNELING IS GENERALLY CYCLIC. THE RING TAPER IS GENERALLY DETERMINED BY A COMBINATION OF THE TUNNEL ALIGNMENT AND WIDTH OF RING. MODEM UNIVERSAL RINGS MAKE RING BUILDING SIMPLE COMPARED TO THE EARLY SYSTEMS.

A RANDOM TRIANGULAR MESH OF CONTINUUM ELEMENTS WAS USED TO AVOID PREFERENCE OF CRACK DEVELOPMENT CONNECTED TO THE ORIENTATION OF THE MESH ELEMENTS. THE MODEL WAS VALIDATED BY CALCULATING THE TESTED SITUATIONS OF THE SCALED TUNNEL SEGMENTS. THE CRACK WIDTH OF 1.8 MM WOULD LEAVE THE REINFORCEMENT DIRECTLY EXPOSED TO THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT. THE 1:10 SCALE FIRE TESTS AND THE NUMERICAL MODELING CONFIRMED THE DEVELOPMENT OF LARGE CRACKS WITH LARGE CRACK WIDTHS AT THE UNEXPOSED SIDE, EVEN AFTER COOLING DOWN. THE PARAMETRIC STUDY SUGGESTED THAT THE ADDITION OF FIBERS IS NOT AN ADEQUATE MEANS TO PREVENT OR MITIGATE THE PROBLEM. PREVENTIVE MEASURES LIKE PASSIVE INSULATION OF THE CONCRETE OR EQUIVALENT MEASURES MAY NEED TO BE CONSIDERED FOR EXISTING TUNNELS.

THERE ARE VARIOUS ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED WHEN REFURBISHING AGEING TUNNEL STRUCTURES TO INCREASE THEIR LIFE EXPECTANCY AND COMPLY WITH HIGHER NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL SAFETY STANDARDS. THE EUROPEAN UNION TUNNEL SAFETY DIRECTIVE WAS APPROVED IN 2004 TO MEET THE REQUIRED NORMS ON KEY ROUTES BY 2014 IN MOST CASES. HEAVY GOODS TRAFFIC IS A MAIN FACTOR IN THE SAFETY RANKING OF TUNNELS EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF IDENTIFIED UNSAFE LOADS.

GROUND CONDITIONS, USE OF PROVISIONAL SUMS, AND EARLY USE PLAY IMPORTANT ROLE WHILE CONSIDERING ISSUES CONCERNING TUNNEL PROJECT RISKS, LEADING TO DISPUTES. UNLESS THE CONTRACTOR IS WILLING TO TAKE THE FULL GROUND RISK, EVERY CONTRACT HAS A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE CLAUSE TO DEFINE THE LEVEL OF GROUND RISK THE CONTRACTOR IS WILLING TO TAKE. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS APPROACH IS THAT PURCHASERS ONLY WANT TO PAY FOR WHAT ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE, RATHER THAN PAY A PREMIUM FOR A CONTINGENCY WHICH MAY NOT TAKE PLACE. MANY DISPUTES RESULT FROM MATTERS THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO CIVIL ENGINEERING ACTIVITIES. DELAY IN PROJECTS ALSO LEAD TO DISPUTES, PUTTING THE PURCHASER AT RISK OF BEING IN VIOLATION OF THIRD PARTY INTERFACE AGREEMENTS OR OTHER STATUTORY DUTIES, WITH THE RISK OF FINES UNLESS THE SCHEME CAN BE USED BEFORE COMPLETION.

THESE ADDITIVES ARE USED TO CONDITION SPOIL IN THE SCREW CONVEYOR. A CRUCIAL COMPONENT OF EPB TUNNELLING APPLICATIONS IS GROUND CONDITIONING. THUS, IN ORDER TO PERMIT QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS OF THE CONDITIONED GROUND BEHAVIOR, IT IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP AND USE A TEST ABLE TO SIMULATE THE EXTRACTION OF EARTH FROM THE CHAMBER WITH A SCREW CONVEYOR.

THE SEGMENTAL LININGS OFFER GREAT POTENTIAL FOR PROJECT SUCCESS IN TERMS OF COST CONTROL AND CONSTRUCTION UNIFORMITY. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS, THE DESIGN OF SEGMENTAL LININGS SHOULD BE HIGHLY INFLUENCED BY SITE INVESTIGATIONS AND BE UNIFORM FOR LONG STRETCHES OF TUNNEL. THE CHOSEN DESIGN MUST BE ABLE TO COPE UP WITH ANY RANGE OF GROUND CONDITIONS WITHIN THE TUNNEL. CURRENTLY, MANY PROJECTS INVOLVING FACILITIES FOR THE LOCAL PRODUCTION OF LINING SEGMENTS ARE LED BY MANUFACTURERS OF THE SEGMENT MOLDS. THESE MOLDS ARE DESIGNED AND MANUFACTURED WITH THE AID OF 2D AND 3D CAD/CAM SOFTWARE MAKING THE SEGMENTS CAPABLE OF FORMING A LINING RING TO THE REQUIRED TOLERANCES.

THE NEW DRIVERLESS SUBWAY LINE WILL BE THE LONGEST IN EUROPE WHEN COMPLETED, WITH AN OVERALL LENGTH OF OVER 44KM. IT WILL RUN ACROSS THE CITY CONNECTING BADALONA AND SANTA COLOMA DE GRAMANET, WITH ZONA FRANCE AND THE AIRPORT, TO THE SOUTH WEST. BASED ON THE TYPOLOGY OF THE GROUND, THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE LINE IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR SECTIONS WHICH INVOLVE THE USE OF FOUR TUNNEL BORING MACHINES (TBMS). THE TUNNEL LINING IS CONSISTED OF PRE CAST CONCRETE SEGMENTS. A DEEP TUNNEL ALIGNMENT WAS SELECTED TO ALLOW THE ALIGNMENT TO PASS BELOW EXISTING UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO REDUCE THE RISK OF SURFACE SETTLEMENT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. A SINGLE LARGE TUNNEL WITH A DOUBLE DECK RAIL TRACK CONFIGURATION HAS BEEN SELECTED FOR THE LINE TO ALLOW STATION PLATFORMS TO BE LOCATED WITHIN THE RUNNING TUNNEL ITSELF, LIMITING THE SURFACE DISRUPTION TO ACCESS SHAFTS IN HIGHLY CONGESTED AREAS.

THE JV OF BILFINGER BERGER, PER AARSLEFF, AND THE E PIHL &SON WAS ASSIGNED TO BUILD THE RUNNING TUNNELS, CROSS PASSAGES AND THE CAVERN FOR THE TRIANGELN STATION. THE CHALLENGE FOR THEM WAS ON HOW TO BUILD THE TWIN 7.9M I.D. RUNNING TUNNELS FROM HOLMA TO THE TRIANGELN STATION CAVERN. AS FOR THE CROSS PASSAGE CONSTRUCTION, DIFFERENT APPROACHES WERE USED BY THE CONTRACTOR TO COMBINE THE SEGMENTAL RINGS THAT WILL BE USED.

A CONGESTION RELIEF SCHEME WILL BE DONE AS PART OF THE VICTORIA STATION UPGRADE IN LONDON WHICH WILL BE HAVING A SPRAYED CONCRETE LINING (SCL) TUNNELLING WORKS AND JET GROUTING. GROUT FORMING WILL BE DONE WITHIN MOST OF THE GROUND IMPROVEMENT WORKS OVER THE ALIGNMENTS OF THE NEW FOOT TUNNELS OR PAID AREA LINK (PAL) WITH SOME REGULAR CUT OFF WALLS. THE SOLUTION TO THE CONGESTION IS TO ADD ADDITIONAL ACCESS TO THE VICTORIA TUBE PLATFORM FROM THE NORTHERN END. PAL TUNNELS WILL BE PLACED AT A LEVEL HIGHER THAN THAT OF VICTORIA LINE STATION AND LONDON CLAY FOR SEVERAL REASONS. THE NUMBER OF TUBE TICKET HALLS AT VICTORIA WILL INCREASE DUE TO THIS RELIEF WORKS WHILE SECANT PILE CONSTRUCTION WILL BE USED TO BUILD THE BOX STATIONS IN STAGES AT BOTH LOCATIONS. HOWEVER, RIVER TERRACE DEPOSITS APPEARS TO BE OF CONCERN FOR THE TUNNEL WORKS AND FOR THE CUT AND COVER BOXES. DEWATERING WILL BE USED FOR GROUND TREATMENT WHEREAS THE DIMENSIONS OF MOST OF THE PAL TUNNELS EXCAVATION WILL BE 6M HIGH AND 5.5M WIDE. A COMBINATION OF SHOTCRETE, MESH AND LATTICE ARCHES WILL BE LINED TO THE BENCHED EXCAVATION. FINALLY, A DESIGN TEAM WILL MAKE SURE OF THE CONSTRUCTABILITY OF THE TUNNELS.

THE SCHEME CALLED ON LONGBORE TO DO A DIRECTIONALLY DRILLED BORE DESIGN THAT WILL ENABLE THE INTERCEPTION AND CAPTURE OF CONTAMINATED MINE WATER IN THE NEATH VALLEY IN SOUTH WALES. THE GLYNCASTLE COLLIERY WAS ABANDONED AND EVENTUALLY THE ADITS COLLAPSED RESULTING IN AN ACCUMULATION OF DISSOLVED IRON OF UP TO 60MG/L WITHIN THE MINE WATER. LONGBORE THOUGHT OF MAKING USE OF HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONAL DRILLING TECHNIQUES TO PULL THE PLUG OUT OF THE BATH AND TO ELIMINATE THE MINE WATER IN A CONTROLLABLE MANNER. THIS DESIGN WAS THEN APPROVED WHEREBY LONGBORE WAS SUB CONTRACTED TO COMPLETE THE REQUIRED DRILLING WORK AND USED AMERICAN AUGERS DD 6 HDD RIG AS WELL AS ITS ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT. THE REMEDIATION SCHEME WAS OF A SUCCESS WHICH WAS ABLE TO CAPTURE THE CONTAMINATED MINE WATERS AND ELIMINATED EMANATIONS FROM THE DIFFUSE DISCHARGE POINTS.

THE FIRST USE OF TUNNEL BORING MACHINE (TBM) IN ICELAND IS MARKED BY THE KARAHNJUKAR HYDROPOWER PROJECT. THE HEADRACE AND DIVERSION TUNNEL HAVE BEEN EXCAVATED THROUGH VARIED VOLCANIC AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS MOSTLY BY TBM WITH SOME DRILL AND BLAST. THE JOKULSA BRANCH IS ALMOST COMPLETED AFTER THE EXCAVATION WAS FINISHED IN 2006. HOWEVER, THE VIEW WAS THAT THE AVAILABLE TECHNICAL DATA ON ROUGHNESS OF LONG WATER TUNNELS WAS INCOMPLETE AND OF LIMITED RELIABILITY. A TEAM DREW UPON METHODOLOGY OF WALL ROUGHNESS AND HYDRAULIC HEADLOSS STUDIES THAT IS BASED ON VISUAL INSPECTION AND LASER MEASUREMENT. THE DATA OBTAINED FROM THESE MEASUREMENTS WERE TRANSFORMED FROM PHYSICAL TO HYDRAULIC ROUGHNESS, DRAWING UPON THREE PARAMETERS: EQUIVALENT SAND GRAIN ROUGHNESS; A FRICTION FACTOR; AND A FLOW RESISTANCE COEFFICIENT. THE RESEARCH DETERMINED THAT THE OVERALL HEADLOSS FROM FRICTION IN TE TBM BORED SECTION OF THE HEADRACE WAS 64M WITH A TOLERANCE OF 10%, WHICH PUTS IT AT THE LOWER END OF THE INITIAL DESIGN ESTIMATE.
