THE EXISTING MONITORING SYSTEM COMPRISES THE FISHERIES MONITORING CENTRE WITH A DEVELOPED DATA BASE AND THE FISHING VESSEL MONITORING SYSTEM. A SWOT ANALYSIS OF THE COAST GUARD CAPABILITY WAS MADE WITH THE AIM OF IMPROVING THE EXISTING SEA FISHING MONITORING SYSTEM IN THE ECOLOGICAL AND FISHERIES PROTECTION ZONE. THE RESULT INDICATES THAT THE MERGING OF THE EXISTING SEA FISHING MONITORING SYSTEM AND THE COAST GUARD OPERATIONAL UNITS WOULD CONSIDERABLY IMPROVE THE SEA FISHING MONITORING SYSTEM IN THE ECOLOGICAL AND FISHERIES PROTECTION ZONE.

THE PROJECT IS SPONSORED BY THE SOUTH BAY CITIES COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS (SBCCOG) AND FUNDED BY THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT (AQMD). ACTIVE USE OF THE FIRST DEMONSTRATION PHASE BEGAN MAY 1, 2010 AND RAN FOR 18 MONTHS ENDING OCTOBER 31,2011. THIS REPORT, BASED ON THE 18 MONTHS OF DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS, AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE POSITIVE ROLE NEVS CAN PLAY IN ADDRESSING THE FOLLOWING ISSUES: REDUCING GREEN HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS, AND CONSUMPTION OF FOSSIL FUELS BY PASSENGER VEHICLES AND LIGHT TRUCKS. INFORMING GOVERNMENT PLANS AND POLICIES CURRENTLY BEING FORMULATED, INCLUDING THE 2012 REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN, CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSIONS INITIATIVE FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE READINESS, AND THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AB 118 VEHICLE VOUCHER PROGRAM. IMPLEMENTING THE SUSTAINABLE SOUTH BAY STRATEGY WITH ITS MOBILITY INITIATIVE BASED ON TRANSITIONING THE GASOLINE FUELED PASSENGER VEHICLE FLEET TO SOME FORM OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE. BECAUSE THIS STUDY IS EXTREMELY DATA RICH, A VERY DETAILED AND SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS HAS BEEN COMPLETED FOR A SOMEWHAT SMALL SAMPLE SIZE OF 29 PARTICIPATING HOUSEHOLDS. FROM THESE FINDINGS IT IS CLEAR THAT SIGNIFICANT GHG AND CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANT REDUCTIONS COULD BE ACHIEVED FROM WIDE SPREAD USE OF NEVS FOR SUBURBAN RESIDENTIAL DRIVING. THIS RESEARCH HAS ALSO IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS MARKET BARRIERS THAT PREVENT WIDE SPREAD ADOPTION OF NEVS AS WELL AS STRATEGIES TO OVERCOME MARKET BARRIERS SUCH AS PRODUCTION QUALITY, SPEED LIMITATIONS, AND NEV PRICES.,BEV; CALIFORNIA; MOBILITY; NEV; ZEV,BEV; CALIFORNIA; CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD; CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSIONS; NEV; REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION; SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT; ZEV; AIR POLLUTION; CARRIER MOBILITY; COMMERCE; GAS EMISSIONS; GREENHOUSE GASES; ELECTRIC VEHICLES,,,,,,,SOUTH BAY CITIES COUNCIL OF GROVERNMENTSUNITED STATES,,,,26TH ELECTRIC VEHICLE SYMPOSIUM 2012, EVS 2012,6 MAY 2012 THROUGH 9 MAY 2012,LOS ANGELES, CA,96815,,9781622764211,,,,ENGLISH,ELECTR.

THE TEAM CONSISTS OF SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, LAWYERS, AND BUSINESS MANAGERS FROM ACADEMIA, PRIVATE INDUSTRY, AND STATE OF TEXAS GOVERNMENT FROM THE FOLLOWING INSTITUTIONS: (1) GULF COAST CARBON CENTER AT THE BUREAU OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGY (BEG), (2) DET NORSKE VERITAS (USA) INC (DNV), (3) WOOD GROUP MUSTANG AND SISTER COMPANY WOOD GROUP KENNY (WOOD GROUP), (4) TEXAS GENERAL LAND OFFICE (GLO), (5) HARTE RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR GULF OF MEXICO STUDIES AT TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY CORPUS CHRISTI (HRI), AND (6) THE UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON LAW CENTER. INDIVIDUAL TEAM MEMBERS HAVE EXPERTISE IN CARBON SEQUESTRATION MONITORING, CO2 PIPELINE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION, AND DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL OFFSHORE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY. THE BMPS WILL BE REVIEWED BY EXTERNAL EXPERTS AFTER IT IS GENERATED AND BEFORE BEING SUBMITTED TO BOEM. THE PURPOSE OF THE BMPS WILL BE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL GUIDANCE TO BOEM AND BSEE (U.S. DOI BUREAU OF SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT) TO ESTABLISH REGULATORY GUIDELINES FOR OFFSHORE COMPONENTS OF FUTURE U.S. CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE, WHICH IS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS SEQUESTRATION, (CCS) INDUSTRY. SUB SEABED GEOLOGIC SEQUESTRATION (GS) IS THE PROCESS WHEREBY CO2 CAPTURED FROM LARGE VOLUME INDUSTRIAL SOURCES (E.G., POWER PLANTS, OIL REFINERIES) WILL BE (1) COMPRESSED TO SUPERCRITICAL STATE AND TRANSPORTED VIA PIPELINE TO OFFSHORE INJECTION WELLS, AND (2) INJECTED INTO GEOLOGIC STRATA DEEP (THOUSANDS OF FEET) BELOW THE SEAFLOOR. OBJECTIVES OF THE CO2 INJECTION WILL BE FOR PURE SEQUESTRATION (I.E., LONG TERM STORAGE OF CO2 IN SUBSEAFLOOR SALINE RESERVOIRS) OR SEQUESTRATION COMBINED WITH ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY (EOR). SUB SEABED GEOLOGIC SEQUESTRATION IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM OCEAN DUMPING (I.E. DISSOLUTION OF CO2 INTO CIRCULATING SEAWATER) OR INJECTION OF CO2 INTO DEEP WATER, SHALLOW SUB SEABED SEDIMENTS. SOME RESEARCHERS PROPOSED IN THE PAST THAT SHALLOW SUBSEAFLOOR DEPTHS (< 1,000 FT) WERE SUFFICIENT FOR PERMANENT CO2 STORAGE IN DEEP MARINE ENVIRONMENTS (> 11,000 FT WATER DEPTH) (E.G., HOUSE ET AL., 2006). HOWEVER, THE SHALLOW SEDIMENTARY SUBSEAFLOOR ENVIRONMENT COULD BECOME UNSTABLE AND ALLOW RELEASE OF CO2 INTO OCEAN WATER, THE END RESULT OF WHICH WOULD BE OCEAN DUMPING. ONE MECHANISM OF SEAFLOOR INSTABILITY COULD BE THE RELEASE OF GAS FROM HYDRATES OWING TO PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE PERTURBATIONS THAT MAY BE INTRODUCED BY SHALLOW DRILLING AND CO2 INJECTION. FURTHERMORE, THE LOGISTICS OF TRANSPORTING CO2 HUNDREDS OF MILES OFFSHORE TO AREAS WITH SUFFICIENT WATER DEPTHS FOR STORAGE IN SHALLOW SUBSEA SEDIMENTS WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE. WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT SUBSEABED GS OF CO2 IS NOT OCEAN DUMPING. ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS FOR ONSHORE GS IS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT SHALLOW DRINKING WATER RESOURCES. INJECTING CO2 DEEP BELOW THE SEAFLOOR WILL AVOID THIS POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCE. BUT THERE ARE SENSITIVE MARINE ENVIRONMENTS OF CONCERN IN OFFSHORE SETTINGS, PROTECTION OF WHICH IS CRITICAL. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING OF MARINE ECOSYSTEMS (NEARSHORE, ALONG CO2 PIPELINE CORRIDORS, AND OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF) AND SUBSEAFLOOR GEOLOGICAL STRATA IN WHICH CO2 WILL BE INJECTED WILL BE A LARGE COMPONENT OF THE BMPS. TOPICS BEING INCLUDED IN THE BMPS, A DRAFT OF WHICH WILL BE SUBMITTED TO BOEM IN JUNE OF 2013, ARE: (1) SITE SELECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION, (2) RISK ANALYSIS, (3) PROJECT PLANNING AND EXECUTION, (4) ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, (5) MITIGATION, (6) INSPECTION AND AUDITING, (7) REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, (8) EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND CONTINGENCY PLANNING, (9) DECOMMISSIONING AND SITE CLOSURE, AND (10) LEGAL ISSUES. WHERE POSSIBLE, WE ARE USING EXISTING REGULATORY, POLICY, AND TECHNICAL GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS AS A STARTING POINT FOR THE BMPS. WE THINK THE MOST LIKELY LOCATION FOR INITIATION OF U.S. OFFSHORE GEOLOGIC SEQUESTRATION OF CO2 WILL BE IN THE WESTERN OR CENTRAL SECTORS OF THE GULF OF MEXICO WHERE EXTENSIVE OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY EXISTS. ACADEMIC MEMBERS OF OUR PROJECT TEAM ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON CRITERIA FOR SITE SELECTION [1]. HOWEVER, PRIVATE INDUSTRY IS ALSO ASSESSING THE FEASIBILITY OF OFFSHORE GEOLOGIC SEQUESTRATION BELOW THE ATLANTIC SEAFLOOR [2].  2012 IEEE.,BOEM; CARBON DIOXIDE; GEOLOGIC SEQUESTRATION; SUBSEAFLOOR,BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMPS); BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES; BOEM; BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENTS; BUSINESS MANAGERS; CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; CO2 STORAGE; CONTINGENCY PLANNING; DEEP WATER; DEEP MARINE; DEPARTMENT OF INTERIORS; DET NORSKE VERITAS; EMERGENCY RESPONSE; ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY; ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING; ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY; EXTERNAL EXPERTS; GEOLOGIC SEQUESTRATIONS; GEOSCIENCES; GULF COAST; GULF OF MEXICO; INDUSTRIAL SOURCES; INJECTION WELLS; JACKSON; LARGE COMPONENTS; LARGE VOLUMES; LEGAL ISSUES; LONG TERM STORAGE; MARINE ECOSYSTEM; MARINE ENVIRONMENT; MOST LIKELY; NEARSHORES; OCEAN WATER; OFFSHORE COMPONENTS; OFFSHORE OIL; OIL REFINERIES; OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELVES; PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS; PIPELINE CORRIDORS; PIPELINE DESIGN; PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE; PRIVATE INDUSTRIES; PROJECT PLANNING; PROJECT TEAM; REGULATORY GUIDELINES; RESEARCH INSTITUTES; SEA FLOOR; SHALLOW DRILLING; SITE CLOSURE; SUB SEAFLOOR; SUPERCRITICAL STATE; TEAM MEMBERS; TECHNICAL GUIDANCE DOCUMENT; TECHNICAL GUIDANCES; UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON; UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS; WATER DEPTH; WOOD GROUPS; ACCIDENT PREVENTION; CARBON; CARBON CAPTURE; ECONOMIC GEOLOGY; ENERGY MANAGEMENT; ENHANCED RECOVERY; ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION; GAS HYDRATES; GAS INDUSTRY; LAWS AND LEGISLATION; MANAGEMENT; OCEAN DUMPING; OCEANOGRAPHY; OFFSHORE OIL WELLS; PETROLEUM RESERVOIR EVALUATION; PIPELINES; SEAWATER; SEDIMENTOLOGY; SITE SELECTION; WATER INJECTION; WATER RESOURCES; CARBON DIOXIDE,,,,,,HTTP://WWW.BEG.UTEXAS.EDU/GCCC/MIOCENE/HTTP://WWW.NYTIMES.COM/2009/04/18/BUSINESS/ENERGYENVIRONMENT/18CLEAN.

NERACOOS IS ONE OF THE ELEVEN REGIONAL ASSOCIATIONS OF THE US INTEGRATED OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM (IOOS). THE BUOYS ARE DEPLOYED AND MAINTAINED BY THE PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY GROUP OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MAINE, INITIALLY AS PART OF THE GULF OF MAINE OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM. ANALYSIS OF THIS LARGE TIMESERIES (OVER 105 SAMPLES FOR A SINGLE DEPTH) SHOWS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT WARMING TRENDS AT ALL DEPTHS FOR ALL LOCATIONS, PROVIDING THE FIRST DEPTH RESOLVED RATES OF TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY FOR THE U.S. EAST COAST FROM CONTINUOUS DATA. ANALYSIS STEPS INCLUDE QUALITY CONTROL OF THE DATA, CALCULATION AND AVERAGING OF DAILY MEANS AND ANOMALIES, ACCORDING TO THE DECORRELATION TIMESCALE ( 20 DAYS) AND CALCULATION OF RATES OF CHANGE WITH LINEAR REGRESSION. USE OF THE DECORRELATION TIMESCALE ALLOWS FOR OPTIMAL DETERMINATION OF ERRORS BY ASSESSING THE NUMBER OF UNIQUE SAMPLES WITHIN THE LARGE DATASET, IN WHICH OBSERVATIONS ARE CLOSELY CORRELATED TO ADJACENT RECORDS. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY AND TIME (P&LT;0.05), AND ALL RATES OF CHANGE ARE POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT (P&LT;0.05), ALTHOUGH THE TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY EXPLAINED BY TIME ALONE IS LOW (AVERAGE 12%). WARMING RATES ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH DEPTH; THE GREATEST RATES ARE OBSERVED MID WATER COLUMN AT THE DEEPEST LOCATIONS. LONG TERM HISTORICAL TIME SERIES INDICATE THAT BETWEEN 1940 AND 1950 THE GULF OF MAINE WARMED AT APPROXIMATELY 0.25 C YR 1, FOLLOWED BY OVER A DECADE OF COOLING AT A SIMILAR RATE, ALL SUPERIMPOSED ON AN OVERALL WARMING TREND OF 0.01 C YR 1. THE PERIOD OF RAPID WARMING RECORDED BY THE NERACOOS BUOYS SINCE 2004, OF SIMILAR MAGNITUDE TO THE 1940 50 WARMING TREND, MAY REPRESENT ANOTHER CYCLE OF DECADAL VARIABILITY OR PERHAPS INDICATE A SHIFT IN THE LONG TERM WARMING TREND. IF CURRENT WARMING TRENDS CONTINUE, THE GULF OF MAINE ECOSYSTEM IS PROJECTED TO UNDERGO A TRANSITION IN SPECIES COMPOSITION AND FOOD WEB STRUCTURE. DIRECT EFFECTS OF WARMING INCLUDE CHANGES IN THERMAL HABITAT (AFFECTING GROWTH, MOLTING AND REPRODUCTION CYCLES) AND SPECIES SHIFTS IN LOCAL SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND BIOGEOGRAPHIC RANGE. WHILE THE TRANSITION STATES AND THEIR TIMING CANNOT BE WELL PREDICTED, THE PRESENT UNDERSTANDING POINTS TO PARTICULAR IMPACTS ON A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT SPECIES THAT RESIDE AT THE SOUTHERN EXTENT OF THEIR BIOGEOGRAPHIC RANGE IN THE GULF OF MAINE. THE DIFFICULTY IN PREDICTION OF ECOSYSTEM STATES AND IMPACTS REINFORCES THE NEED TO OBSERVE NOT ONLY TEMPERATURE AND HYDROGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, BUT ALSO LOWER LEVEL ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY, DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF KEY DOMINANT SPECIES IN THE COASTAL ZONE, AN AREA NOT WELL OBSERVED BY CURRENT SAMPLING STRATEGIES. SUSTAINED HIGH TEMPORAL FREQUENCY, FIXED LOCATION TIME SERIES ARE CRITICAL TO DETECTION OF PHYSICAL VARIABILITY IN AS SHORT A TIMEFRAME AS POSSIBLE. WITHOUT COMPARABLE SAMPLING OF ECOLOGICAL VARIABILITY, WE WILL NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR TIMELY DETECTION OF ECOSYSTEM RESPONSES. KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXTENT OF CHANGE IN THE GULF OF MAINE COASTAL ECOSYSTEM WILL CONTRIBUTE TO INFORMED DECISIONS FOR ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF GULF OF MAINE ECOSYSTEM RESOURCES.  2012 IEEE.,,A TRANSITIONS; ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT; COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS; COASTAL OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM; CONTINUOUS DATA; CURRENT SAMPLINGS; DE CORRELATIONS; DECADAL VARIABILITY; DEPTH RESOLVED; DOMINANT SPECIES; EAST COAST; ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY; ECOSYSTEM RESPONSE; ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABILITY; FOOD WEBS; GULF OF MAINE; HIGH TEMPORAL FREQUENCY; INFORMED DECISION; INTEGRATED OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEMS; LARGE DATASET; OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEMS; OCEANOGRAPHIC MEASUREMENTS; PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY; RAPID DETECTION; REGIONAL ASSOCIATIONS; SPECIES COMPOSITION; TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY; THERMAL HABITATS; TIME SCALES; TRANSITION STATE; UNIVERSITY OF MAINE; WATER COLUMNS; BUOYS; COASTAL ZONES; OCEANOGRAPHY; ECOSYSTEMS,,,,,,ABEL, D., (2012) CUTBACKS SOUGHT IN REGIONAL COD CATCH, , BOSTON GLOBE.

CONSTRUCTED IN 27 MONTHS FROM 1898 TO 1900, THIS 176 KILOMETRE NARROW GAUGE RAILWAY CARRIED THOUSANDS OF PROSPECTORS AND THEIR SUPPLIES TO THE KLONDIKE GOLD RUSH FROM THE PACIFIC OCEAN. THE RAILWAY PROVIDED THE FIRST EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION LINK FROM THE PORT OF SKAGWAY, ALASKA OVER THE COAST MOUNTAIN RANGE INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE YUKON, AND OPENED UP THE YUKON TERRITORY TO SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT BY PROVIDING A MAJOR ALL SEASON TRANSPORTATION LINK FOR THE TERRITORY FOR OVER 80 YEARS. THE RAILWAY ALSO HAD AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ALASKA HIGHWAY, AND THE TRANSPORT OF ORE FROM THE YUKON MINES TO SOUTHERN MARKETS. THE NARROW GAUGE YUKON AND WHITE PASS RAILWAY CLIMBS ALMOST 873 METRES FROM SEA LEVEL AT THE PORT OF SKAGWAY TO THE WHITE PASS SUMMIT IN A DISTANCE OF ONLY 32 KILOMETRES. THIS STEEP GRADE OVER THE COAST MOUNTAINS WAS CONSTRUCTED WITH MANUAL LABOUR; THE MAIN EQUIPMENT, ASIDE FROM BLASTING POWDER, CONSISTED OF PICKS AND SHOVELS.

THE DEPLOYMENT OF DROGUE DEVICES FROM A REUSABLE BOOSTER, WHEN STAGING, AND REMAINING ATTACHED TO THOSE PASSIVE DRAG DEVICES UNTIL THE FIRST STAGE BOOSTER RETURNS TO SUFFICIENTLY DENSE ATMOSPHERE TO COMMENCE A GLIDE BACK TOWARDS THE RECOVERY SITE PROVIDES MULTIPLE BENEFITS. THE EMPLOYMENT OF A RESIDUAL FUEL BURN AT LOW THRUST AND EXHAUSTED THROUGH THE MAIN NOZZLE WOULD PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL PROPULSION (AKA ROCKET BACK) IN THE RETURN GLIDE AND NEGATE THE OTHERWISE SIGNIFICANT BASE DRAG OF THE VEHICLE DURING THAT GLIDE. CALCULATIONS WILL BE PRESENTED TO SUPPORT THE ASSERTIONS THAT THE RESULT OF THIS APPROACH: 1.) MINIMIZES THE DAMAGE BY PLUME IMPINGEMENT AND POTENTIAL AERODYNAMIC INSTABILITY DURING SECOND STAGE SEPARATION BY RAPIDLY PROVIDING HUNDREDS OF FEET OF SEPARATION IN SECONDS; 2.) PASSIVELY ABATES THE VERTICAL AND DOWN RANGE COAST OF THE BOOSTER VEHICLE AFTER SEPARATION, WHILE MAINTAINING THE ORIENTATION OF THE VEHICLE TO THE FLIGHT VECTOR; 3.) RETURNS THE REUSABLE FIRST STAGE TO SUB SONIC FLOWS AT ALTITUDES IN EXCESS OF 75,000 FEET, THEREBY ELIMINATING THE CLASSICAL REENTRY ENVIRONMENTS (EXPERIENCES 2,000 FPS AT 90,000 FEET); 4.) RETURNS THE VEHICLE TO FREE GLIDING FLIGHT AT ALTITUDES ABOVE 40,000 FEET; 5.) REQUIRES NOTHING MORE EXOTIC THAN BARE METAL FOR ALL VEHICLE SKINS (A CONVENTIONAL SUPER SONIC FIGHTER COULD REENTER; AND 6.) REQUIRES NOTHING MORE THAN ORDINARY AIRCRAFT TURN AROUND INSPECTIONS AND SERVICES TO PREPARE THE AIRFRAME FOR A NEW LAUNCH CYCLE. AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT IS THAT THIS CONCEPT IDEALLY STAGES AT ABOUT 180,000 FEET AND MACH 5.5. THIS IS A HIGHER ALTITUDE AND MACH NUMBER THAN PUBLICLY DISCLOSED FOR ROCKET BACK, AND ALLOWS MUCH MORE OF THE LAUNCH ENERGIES TO BE PROVIDED BY THE REUSABLE STAGE, WHICH WILL DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE OPERATING COST FURTHER. IN ALL, THIS IS A LOWER COST, LOWER RISK AND MORE RAPIDLY CYCLED SYSTEM THAN CONCEPTS WITHOUT SUCH COMPLETE PASSIVE AND ACTIVE DRAG MANAGEMENT. THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPTIMIZE THE REUSABLE BOOSTERS AERODYNAMIC DESIGN FOR SUB SONIC OPERATION (NO SUPERSONIC, ENDOVER END, OR BACKWARDS FLIGHT) WILL REDUCE THE DEVELOPMENT COST AS WELL. FURTHER, THIS CONCEPT REPRESENTS A LOW DEVELOPMENT COST OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH, NOT INHERENT IN MORE COMPLEX, BUT LOWER PERFORMING DESIGNS.  2012 BY THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF AERONAUTICS AND ASTRONAUTICS, INC.

USING THE VISION OF U.S. IOOS FOR COASTAL OCEAN OBSERVING, THE GULF OF MEXICO COASTAL OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM (GCOOS) REGIONAL ASSOCIATION HAS BEGUN A PILOT PROJECT TO BUILD AN INTEGRATED WATER QUALITY NETWORK IN SOUTHWEST FLORIDA THAT EXTENDS FROM THE COASTAL OCEAN INTO THE ADJACENT ESTUARIES AND RIVERS UNDER TIDAL INFLUENCE. THE PILOT CONSISTS OF FOUR PHASES: IDENTIFICATION OF FEDERAL AND NON FEDERAL NEAR REAL TIME OBSERVING RESOURCES IN THE PILOT AREA; DEVELOPMENT OF DATA SHARING PRACTICES WITH THE AREAS PARTICIPATING DATA PROVIDERS; AND INTEGRATION OF THE DATA SETS AND FUSION OF DATA TYPES INTO PRODUCTS USEFUL TO A RANGE OF LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL STAKEHOLDERS. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE FOURTH PHASE OF THE PILOT EXPANSION THROUGHOUT THE GULF WILL BE PURSUED. THE PROJECT WILL BE ADJUSTED AND THEN EXPANDED SOUTHWARD THROUGH THE FLORIDA KEYS, NORTHWARD TO THE BIG BEND, AND WESTWARD THROUGH THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE TO ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, LOUISIANA, AND TEXAS. THROUGH DATA INTEGRATION, THE INDIVIDUAL, SINGLE PURPOSE OCEANOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS WILL BE COMBINED IN WAYS THAT WILL IMPROVE THE DECISION SUPPORT INFORMATION AND TOOLS NECESSARY FOR COASTAL MANAGERS, COMMUNITIES, AND OTHERS AT THE LOCAL, STATE, REGIONAL, AND NATIONAL LEVELS.  2012 IEEE.,GULF COAST OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM; GULF OF MEXICO; MANAGEMENT; POLICY; U.S INTEGRATED OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM; WATER QUALITY,ALABAMA; COASTAL OCEAN; COASTAL OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM; DATA TYPE; DATA SHARING PRACTICES; FLORIDA; FLORIDA KEYS; GULF OF MEXICO; INTEGRATED OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEMS; LOUISIANA; METEOROLOGICAL DATA; MISSISSIPPI; NATIONAL LEVEL; OBSERVING SYSTEMS; OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEMS; OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS; PILOT PROJECTS; REGIONAL ASSOCIATIONS; U.S. IOOS; DATA INTEGRATION; DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; METEOROLOGY; OFFSHORE OIL WELLS; PUBLIC POLICY; WATER QUALITY; OCEANOGRAPHY,,,,,,JOCHENS, A.E., NOWLIN JR., W.D., DEVELOPMENT OF A COASTAL OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM FOR THE GULF OF MEXICO (2007) MTS JOURNAL, 40 (4), PP. 100 109; GOVERNORS.

AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SANTA BARBARA ARE DEVELOPING A METHOD BY WHICH HF RADAR ANTENNA RESPONSE PATTERNS CAN BE CALIBRATED AUTOMATICALLY OVER TIME. CURRENTLY, OVER 130 HF RADAR UNITS ARE PROVIDING COASTAL SURFACE CURRENT MAPS TO THE PUBLIC VIA THE U.S. INTEGRATED OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM (USIOOS): HTTP://WWW.IOOS.GOV/HFRADAR/. THESE REAL TIME DATA ARE USED FOR COAST GUARD SEARCH AND RESCUE, HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SPILLS RESPONSE, WATER QUALITY MONITORING, MONITORING HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS, FISHERIES MANAGEMENT, MODELING, MARINE NAVIGATION, OCEAN ENERGY PRODUCTION. TECHNIQUES FOR IMPROVED, AUTOMATED QUALITY ASSURANCE OF THE DATA PROVIDED BY COASTAL RADAR STATIONS, SUCH AS THE ONE DISCUSSED HERE, WILL IMPROVE THE EFFICACY OF EFFORTS IN THESE AREAS. PASSING VESSELS PROVIDE A STEADY SUPPLY OF TARGETS FOR WHICH THE ECHOES IN THE HF DOPPLER SPECTRA CAN BE USED AS SOURCE SIGNALS. THE AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM (AIS) TRANSMISSIONS FROM THESE VESSELS PROVIDE THE POSITION AND, THEREFORE, BEARING TO THE VESSEL. BY ASSOCIATING THE KNOWN AIS POSITIONS WITH HF DOPPLER ECHOES, A LOW COST CALIBRATION PROCEDURE CAN BE IMPLEMENTED WHICH CAN REDUCE OR ELIMINATE MORE LABOR INTENSIVE ALTERNATIVES. THIS METHOD IS DEMONSTRATED USING DATA FROM MID RANGE SYSTEMS IN THE SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL THAT ARE OPERATING IN THE 13 MHZ BAND.

THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE OIL INDUSTRY IN ANGOLA WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A GREATER INTEREST IN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, SPECIFICALLY IN AREAS OF OIL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS. THE CABINDA GULF OIL COMPANY CHEVRON (CABGOC) HAS IMPLEMENTED A SUCCESSFUL ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAM TO PROTECT THREE ENDANGERED SEA TURTLE SPECIES IN ITS ANGOLAN OPERATIONAL AREAS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE MALONGO SEA TURTLE PROTECTION PROGRAM TO MITIGATE THE INFLUENCE OF THE MALONGO CAMP OPERATIONS ON THE SEA TURTLE NESTING HABITAT OF THE OLIVE RIDLEY TURTLE (LEPIDOCHELYS OLIVACEA), LEATHERBACK TURTLE (DERMOCHELYS CORIACEA), AND GREEN TURTLE (CHELONIA MYDAS). THE HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT AND SAFETY (HES) ENVIRONMENTAL TEAM AND A TEAM OF FOUR SURVEYORS (FORMER CABINDA FISHERMEN) USED NEST MONITORING TECHNIQUES AND HIGH QUALITY GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS) MAPPING CAPABILITY TO MONITOR THE SEA TURTLE NESTS IN THE 4 KILOMETERS MALONGO CAMP BEACH. TURTLE MONITORING INCLUDED NIGHT PATROLS OVER A SEVEN MONTH PERIOD (SEPTEMBER TO APRIL), COUNTING NESTS, GIS MAPPING OF ALL NESTS, RELOCATING NESTS FROM AREAS OF POSSIBLE HUMAN DISTURBANCE, TAGGING AND MEASURING SEA TURTLES, MONITORING HATCHING SUCCESS, AND RELEASING SEA TURTLE HATCHLINGS. SINCE ITS START IN 2002, THE PROGRAM HAS REGISTERED OVER 1,000 NESTS, TAGGED AND MEASURED OVER 40 SEA TURTLES, AND RELEASED OVER 29,000 HATCHLINGS TO THE SEA. ADDITIONALLY, A RECENT STUDY OF THE CABINDA COAST INDICATES THAT THE MALONGO PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SEA TURTLE PROTECTION PROGRAM IN CABINDA IN TERMS OF NEST HATCHING SUCCESS, POACHING PROTECTION, AND DOCUMENTING NESTING PATTERNS. THIS PROGRAM HAS HELPED BUILD PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE COMMUNITY, OIL INDUSTRY PARTNERS, AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL MINISTRY OF ANGOLA AS WELL AS INCREASED PUBLIC AWARENESS ON SEA TURTLE PROTECTION.

WATER IS PRODUCED AS A BY PRODUCT OF THE CSG PRODUCTION PROCESS, WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF THIS ASSOCIATED WATER (CALLED CSG WATER) WIDELY ACCEPTED AS ONE OF THE INDUSTRYS MAIN CHALLENGES. THE AUSTRALIA PACIFIC LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) PROJECT IS A COAL SEAM GAS (CSG) TO LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN ORIGIN, CONOCOPHILLIPS AND SINOPEC GROUP. THE AUSTRALIA PACIFIC LNG PROJECT PROPOSES TO SUPPLY CSG FROM THE WALLOONS GAS FIELDS IN SOUTH CENTRAL QUEENSLAND TO A LNG PLANT LOCATED ON CURTIS ISLAND, OFF THE COAST OF GLADSTONE, ON THE CENTRAL QUEENSLAND COAST. ORIGIN IS THE UPSTREAM OPERATOR OF THE AUSTRALIA PACIFIC LNG PROJECT (THE PROJECT). IN THE WALLOONS COAL SEAMS, CSG WATER KEEPS NATURAL GAS ADSORBED AS A THIN FILM ON THE SURFACE OF THE COAL. THE PRESSURE OF THE SURROUNDING BODY OF CSG WATER ALLOWS THE GAS TO BE RETAINED WITHIN THE SEAM BY ADSORPTION TO THE SURFACE OF COAL PARTICLES. HENCE TO EXTRACT GAS THE WATER PRESSURE NEEDS TO BE REDUCED BY TRANSFERRING THE WATER TO THE SURFACE. WATER FROM CSG WELLS EXTRACTED TO ENABLE GAS PRODUCTION IS VARIABLE IN QUANTITY, DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND INFLUENCES GAS PRODUCTION RATES. VARIABILITY IN WATER PRODUCTION CAN BE DUE TO THE LOCATION OF THE WELL, COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER WELLS, DECLINE IN PRESSURE DURING WELL LIFE AND PERMEABILITY OF THE COAL SEAM. THE QUALITY OF THE CSG WATER CAN VARY FROM WELL TO WELL AND MORE NOTICEABLY ACROSS THE PROJECT AREA, BUT IT CONSISTENTLY CONTAINS ELEVATED QUANTITIES OF SALTS. APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT OF CSG WATER IS REQUIRED TO MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH UNTREATED CSG WATER. USES FOR SUCH LARGE AND DIFFICULT TO PREDICT QUANTITIES OF BOTH TREATED AND UNTREATED WATER IN THE WALLOONS GAS FIELDS REGION ARE LIMITED. AS SUCH, IT IS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE TREATMENT, USE AND DISPOSAL OF CSG WATER PRESENT A CHALLENGE FOR THE PROJECT AND THE CSG INDUSTRY IN GENERAL. THIS PAPER WILL USE THE TALINGA DEVELOPMENT AREA, ESTABLISHED IN 2008 AND LOCATED SOUTHWEST OF CHINCHILLA IN QUEENSLAND AS A CASE STUDY IN WATER MANAGEMENT ADOPTED BY AUSTRALIA PACIFIC LNG. IN PARTICULAR, THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON THE DISCHARGE OF TREATED CSG WATER TO SURFACE WATERCOURSES (CREEKS/RIVERS) ONE OF A SUITE OF WATER MANAGEMENT OPTIONS USED BY THE PROJECT. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK GOVERNING THIS ASPECT OF WATER MANAGEMENT AND ORIGINS APPROACH TO ENSURING THE ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES OF RECEIVING WATERS ARE PRESERVED. AT TIME OF WRITING, THE GAS PRODUCTION FROM THE TALINGA FIELD HAS BEEN OPERATED UNDER AN ENVIRONMENTAL AUTHORITY (EA) WITH PROVISION FOR AN INITIAL 18 MONTH CONTINUOUS DISCHARGE TO THE CONDAMINE RIVER OF 20 ML/D AS THE PRELIMINARY WATER MANAGEMENT OPTION UNDERPINNING A BROADER MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. THE BROADER STRATEGY INCLUDES TRANSITIONING TO A MANAGED DISCHARGE FLOW REGIME THAT MIMICS THE NATURAL FLOWS OF THE RIVER.

THE MID ATLANTIC REGIONAL ASSOCIATION COASTAL OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM (MARACOOS) WAS ESTABLISHED TO COORDINATE THE VARIETY OF OCEANOGRAPHIC DATA COLLECTORS AND INFORMATION PROVIDERS IN AN EFFORT TO LEVERAGE EFFORTS ACROSS THE REGION AND ENABLE THE EFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT OF MEANINGFUL INFORMATION PRODUCTS AND DECISION TOOLS. ALTHOUGH MARACOOS PARTNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED NUMEROUS SUCCESSES OVER THE PAST 8 YEARS, TRADITIONAL ASPECTS OF THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF IOOS CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE MARACOOS ABILITY TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL PRODUCTS. THE IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE PUSH OF THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY AND THE PULL FROM THE USER COMMUNITY RESULTS IN MISCOMMUNICATION AND LESS EFFECTIVE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. A STRUCTURED APPROACH IS NEEDED TO ENHANCE THE USER COMMUNITY PULL AND MOVE TOWARD MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THIS STRUCTURED APPROACH COULD BE REALIZED THROUGH A STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROCESS TO STRENGTHEN USER INPUTS INTO NEEDS ASSESSMENTS AND PRODUCT DESIGN. A FORMAL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE WILL REQUIRE INVESTMENTS THAT RESULT IN MORE FOCUSED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND A STRONGER FOUNDATION FOR INVESTMENTS INTO NEW PLATFORMS AND SENSORS, MODELING, AND DATA MANAGEMENT. ULTIMATELY, THE RESULT WILL BE BETTER INFORMATION PRODUCTS THAT LEAD TO BETTER DECISIONS THAT HELP SAVE LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS, AND MAINTAIN THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE MID ATLANTIC REGION.  2012 IEEE.,APPLIED DATA; APPLIED RESEARCH; COASTAL; COASTAL OCEAN OBSERVATIONS; END USER; FORECASTING; INTEGRATED OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM; IOOS; MACOORA; MARACOOS; MARCOOS; MID ATLANTIC; OBSERVING; OCEAN; OCEAN OBSERVING; PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHIC DATA; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; REGIONAL ASSOCIATION; RESEARCH TO OPERATIONS; STAKEHOLDER; USER,APPLIED DATA; APPLIED RESEARCH; COASTAL; COASTAL OCEAN; END USERS; INTEGRATED OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEMS; IOOS; MACOORA; MARACOOS; MARCOOS; MID ATLANTIC; OBSERVING; OCEAN; OCEAN OBSERVING; OCEANOGRAPHIC DATA; REGIONAL ASSOCIATIONS; STAKEHOLDER; USER; FORECASTING; INFORMATION MANAGEMENT; INVESTMENTS; OCEANOGRAPHY; PRODUCT DESIGN; RESEARCH; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT,,,,,,KUSKA, G.F., (2005) COLLABORATION TOWARD A MORE INTEGRATED NATIONAL OCEAN POLICY: ASSESSMENT OF SEVERAL U.S. FEDERAL INTERAGENCY COORDINATION GROUPS, , ANN ARBOR, MI: UMI; KUSKA, G.F., THOROUGHGOOD, C.A., MOORE, P., (2012) ENHANCING STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT: TOWARD NEXT GENERATION PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IN THE R2O PROCESS, , WASHINGTON, DC: IOOS SUMMIT; LANZEROTTI, L.J., RESEARCH TO OPERATIONS PAIRED WITH OPERATIONS TO RESEARCH (2011) SPACE WEATHER, 9, 1P. , S02003; MALONE, T.C., RESEARCH TO OPERATIONS AND BACK AGAIN (2006) MTS/IEEE OCEANS 2006, , BOSTON, MA; (2000) MERRIAM WEBSTERS COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY, , MERRIAM WEBSTER.

THE SUBSIDENCE DUE TO GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION, INCREASED DEVELOPMENT, NATURAL CONSOLIDATION OF SOIL AND TECTONICS IN JAKARTA HAS BEEN KNOWN SINCE THE EARLY PART OF THE 20TH CENTURY. EVIDENCE OF LAND SUBSIDENCE EXISTS THROUGH MONITORING WITH GPS, LEVEL SURVEYS AND PRELIMINARY INSAR INVESTIGATIONS [1]. WORLD BANK STUDIES CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATE LAND SUBSIDENCE IN JAKARTA OCCURRING AT AN AVERAGE RATE OF 5 CM PER YEAR, AND IN SOME AREAS, OVER 1 METER WAS ALREADY OBSERVED. RECENT STUDIES OF LAND SUBSIDENCE FOUND THAT WHILE TYPICAL SUBSIDENCE RATES WERE 7.5 10 CM A YEAR, IN LOCALIZED AREAS OF NORTH JAKARTA SUBSIDENCE IN THE RANGE 15 25 CM A YEAR WAS OCCURRING, WHICH IF SUSTAINED, WOULD RESULT IN THEM SINKING TO 4 TO 5 METERS BELOW SEA LEVEL BY 2025. LAND SUBSIDENCE WILL REQUIRE MAJOR INTERVENTIONS, INCLUDING INCREASED PUMPING, DIKES AND MOST LIKELY INTRODUCING MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT FOR SEA DEFENCE [1]. WITH THE INCREASING PREVALENCE OF EARTH OBSERVATION (EO), THE WORLD BANK AND THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY (ESA) HAVE SET UP A PARTNERSHIP THAT AIMS AT HIGHLIGHTING THE POTENTIAL OF EO INFORMATION TO SUPPORT THE MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF WORLD BANK PROJECTS.

PARTICIPANTS FROM FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT USE THE TASK FORCES AS A VENUE TO SHARE INFORMATION AND MINIMIZE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN EXISTING OCEAN USES AND OFFSHORE WIND FARM CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATIONS. TASK FORCE PARTICIPANTS OFTEN ONLY MAKE INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN STATIC MAP FORM, MAKING COMPARISONS BETWEEN DATA SETS CHALLENGING. TO ADDRESS THIS, THE NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA RENEWABLE ENERGY TASK FORCES ARE COLLABORATING WITH THE MARINECADASTRE.GOV TEAM TO FACILITATE DATA SHARING. THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA) AND BOEM HAVE BEEN COLLABORATING SINCE 2007 ON MARINECADASTRE.GOV, AN INTEGRATED MARINE INFORMATION SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES JURISDICTIONAL, LEGAL, PHYSICAL, ECOLOGICAL, AND OCEAN USE DATA IN A COMMON GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS) FRAMEWORK. THE MARINECADASTRE.GOV WEBSITE WAS DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO A CALL FOR A MARINE INFORMATION SYSTEM TO SUPPORT ALTERNATIVE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT ON THE OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF IN SECTION 388 OF THE ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2005. ALTHOUGH THE WEBSITE HAS BEEN DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO SUPPORT RENEWABLE ENERGY SITING WITHIN THE U.S. OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF, IT IS ALSO BEING USED FOR VARIOUS OTHER OCEAN RELATED EFFORTS. THE MARINECADASTRE.GOV WEBSITE HAS THREE PRIMARY FOCUS AREAS: WEB MAP VIEWERS AND DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS, A SPATIAL DATA REGISTRY, AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND REGIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING. THE NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA WIND ENERGY TASK FORCES ARE COMBINING NATIONAL SCALE DATA FROM THE WEBSITE WITH INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO THEIR PLANNING AREAS INTO SIMPLE VIEWERS AVAILABLE IN THE MAP GALLERY SECTION OF THE WEBSITE. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS USERS TO ASSESS AND MINIMIZE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION WITH EXISTING OCEAN USES. MULTIPLE ISSUES, SUCH AS FISHING, SHIPPING, AND DEFENSE, ARE VIEWED AND CONSIDERED SIMULTANEOUSLY, IN ONE LOCATION, ALLOWING MEMBERS OF THE TASK FORCE TO SEE THEIR OWN DATA IN A WIDER CONTEXT. THIS ENHANCES THE UTILITY OF THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY COMPARED USING STATIC MAPS. USERS CAN TURN DATA LAYERS ON AND OFF AND PAN AND ZOOM TO SPECIFIC LOCATIONS IN THE PLANNING AREA AS QUESTIONS ARISE. THE NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA WIND ENERGY TASK FORCE DATA VIEWERS ARE A SIMPLE BUT POWERFUL MECHANISM FOR IDENTIFYING AREAS OF POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY, ENHANCING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN TASK FORCE MEMBERS, AND INCREASING THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TASK FORCE PROCESS. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO SUPPORT THE BOEM TASK FORCES IN MAKING SOUND DECISIONS WITH THE BEST AVAILABLE SPATIAL INFORMATION TO FACILITATE RESPONSIBLE SITING OF OFFSHORE RENEWABLE ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS PRESENTATION WILL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE PRIMARY FOCUS AREAS OF THE MARINECADASTRE.GOV PROJECT AND ITS UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION GIVEN TO THE COLLABORATIONS WITH THE BOEM LED RENEWABLE ENERGY TASK FORCES IN NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA. DETAILS ON HOW THESE TWO BOEM TASK FORCES ARE INCORPORATING USE OF THE DATA VIEWERS INTO THEIR DECISION MAKING PROCESSES, THE TYPES OF DATA BEING CONSIDERED, AND POTENTIAL NEXT STEPS FOR ANALYZING THE SPATIAL INFORMATION IN A GROUP SETTING WILL BE DISCUSSED.  2012 IEEE.,CADASTRE; DATA SHARING; GIS; MARINE; MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING; NORTH CAROLINA; RENEWABLE ENERGY; SOUTH CAROLINA; TASK FORCE MEETING,CADASTRE; DATA SHARING; MARINE; MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING; NORTH CAROLINA; RENEWABLE ENERGIES; SOUTH CAROLINA; TASK FORCE; DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS; ENERGY MANAGEMENT; ENERGY POLICY; GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS; INFORMATION SYSTEMS; MARINE ENGINEERING; OFFSHORE WIND FARMS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; WEBSITES; OCEANOGRAPHY,,,,,,(2009) NOAA INTERNAL REPORTS ON COASTAL AND MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING, , NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION; PUBLIC LAW 109 58: ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2005.

WITH THIS ACCELERATED GROWTH IN DEMAND FOR GAS, PARTICULARLY WITH THE ONSHORE CSG PRODUCTION, COMES THE MATTER OF THE ASSOCIATED ENVIRONMENTAL AFFECTS AND THE NEED FOR SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION OF IMPACTS. WHY DO I SINGLE OUT THE CSG INDUSTRY IN THIS REGARD AFTER ALL THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF CONSIDERABLE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION DURING THE MANY DECADES OF PRODUCTION IN THIS COUNTRY, AND HAS A VERY PROUD RECORD IN DOING THE RIGHT THING. THIS PAPER RELATES SPECIFICALLY TO ONE UNIQUE ATTRIBUTE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTION OF CSG, NAMELY THE NEED TO EXTRACT GROUNDWATER FROM THE GAS PRODUCTION WELLS IN ORDER THAT THEY BE DEPRESSURISED AS A PRECURSOR TO GAS RELEASE. PUMPING GROUNDWATER FROM OF THE COAL SEAM AQUIFERS TARGETED FOR THE RESOURCE REDUCES THE HYDRAULIC PRESSURE TO THE POINT THAT THE ADSORPTION BONDS HOLDING THE METHANE TO THE SURFACES OF THE COAL CLEATS (OR MICROFRACTURES) ARE REVERSED AND THE GAS MOVES INTO THE GASEOUS PHASE, AND IS HENCE AVAILABLE TO FLOW TO THE WELL UNDER THE PREVAILING HYDRAULIC GRADIENTS. TYPICALLY, A CSG WELL IS PUMPED FOR ITS GROUNDWATER, PRODUCING ITS PEAK FLOWS EARLY IN THE LIFE OF THE WELL, WITH FLOWS OF WATER TAPERING OFF WITH TIME, AS GAS FLOWS INCREASE AND PEAK SOME YEARS INTO ITS LIFE. (FIGURE PRESENTED) THE CONSEQUENCE IS, FOR A TYPICAL WELLFIELD ARRANGEMENT (OF APPROXIMATELY 800 M BY 800 M GRID PENETRATIONS), CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES OF WATER ARE PRODUCED.

DURING THE 60 DAYS OF MONTHLY SURVEYS, WE RECORDED OVER 2.6X106 RECORDS OF DATA WITH SHIP POSITION INFORMATION. THERE WERE 1181 HOURS OF AIS AND 540 HOURS OF RADAR DATA COLLECTED FOR A MONTHLY MEAN OF 98 AND 45 HOURS FOR AIS AND RADAR RESPECTIVELY. THESE DATA REPRESENTED 1411 TRANSITS BY VESSELS BROADCASTING AIS FOR A TOTAL OF 69,606KM OF TRACK LINE, AND VESSELS ACQUIRED WITH RADAR REPRESENTED A TOTAL OF 506 TRANSITS FOR A TOTAL OF 8,702KM OF TRACK LINE. AIS AND RADAR DATA RESULTED IN 1.2 AND 0.9 TRANSITS PER HOUR RESPECTIVELY. WE CORRECTED THE AIS DATA TO MATCH RADAR EFFORT, AND, WHEN EFFORT WAS EQUAL, AIS DATA REPRESENTED ONLY 49.7% OF THE TOTAL LARGE VESSEL TRANSITS OBSERVED, AND TRANSITS PER HOUR WERE EQUAL FOR CORRECTED AIS AND RADAR DATA. WE RECORDED MORE INBOUND VESSELS USING AIS AND MORE OUTBOUND VESSELS WITH RADAR. THE DENSITY PATTERN OF VESSELS RECORDED USING AIS DIFFERED FROM THE RADAR PATTERN. THERE WAS A VERY DISCRETE PATTERN FOR VESSELS BROADCASTING AN AIS SIGNAL THAT CORRESPONDED WITH THE SHIPPING LANE BUOYS. VESSELS RECORDED USING RADAR, ON THE OTHER HAND, WERE MORE DISPERSED AND DISPLAYED A LESS DISCRETE PATTERN COVERING A LARGE AREA OUTSIDE OF THE SHIP BUOYS. WINTER WAS THE SEASON WITH THE FEWEST VESSEL TRANSITS FOR BOTH DATA COLLECTION METHODS (23.8% AIS; 17.0% RADAR), THOUGH THERE WAS NOT A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE OVER OTHER SEASONS IN THE AIS DATA. SPRING, SUMMER AND FALL WERE SIMILAR FOR AIS (24.2%, 25.7%, 26.3% RESPECTIVELY), BUT FALL (31.4%) HAD CONSIDERABLY MORE VESSELS RECORDED BY RADAR THAN SPRING AND SUMMER (26.5%, 25.1% RESPECTIVELY). WHEN EXAMINING VESSEL TYPE DATA, MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF THE VESSEL TRANSITS RECORDED USING AIS WERE CARGO VESSELS (68%; N337). EXCLUDING UNKNOWN VESSELS, MILITARY VESSELS MADE UP 47% (N179) OF THE VESSELS WE IDENTIFIED WITH RADAR, FOLLOWED BY FISHING (32%; N120) AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT (USCG) VESSELS (10%, N38). SPATIAL ANALYSIS WAS NECESSARY TO ACCURATELY EVALUATE SHIP SPEED OVER THE ENTIRE STUDY AREA. SPATIAL ANALYSES OF THESE DATA ALLOWED US TO EXAMINE SPEED BEHAVIOR IN A GRID FORMAT, REDUCING THE EFFECT OF DIRECTIONAL BIAS FROM AN OVERREPRESENTATION OF RECORDS FROM RELATIVELY SLOW MOVING VESSELS. WITHOUT UTILIZING SPATIAL ANALYSIS, ONE COULD DRAW THE CONCLUSION THAT VESSELS WERE TRANSITING THE AREA MORE SLOWLY THAN THEY ACTUALLY WERE BECAUSE AIS SPEED RECORDS ARE SKEWED BY THE GREATER NUMBER OF SPEED POINTS FOR SLOWER VESSELS. THERE WAS AN OBVIOUS REDUCTION IN SPEED OF VESSELS TRANSMITTING AIS IN THE SHIPPING LANES FROM BEFORE TO AFTER THE SHIP STRIKE RULE THAT WAS ENACTED IN DECEMBER 2008 TO PROTECT THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC RIGHT WHALE (EUBALAENA GLACIALIS). THE SHIP STRIKE RULE IDENTIFIED A SEASONAL MANAGEMENT AREA (SMA) WITHIN WHICH COMMERCIAL SHIPS 65 FT. IN LENGTH WERE REQUIRED TO SLOW TO 10KTS OR LESS FOR PART OF THE YEAR (50 CFR224.105). ALTHOUGH VESSELS SLOWED, MANY WERE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE MANDATORY SPEED LIMIT OF THE RULE. SPEED RESTRICTIONS HAD NO EFFECT ON VESSELS OBSERVED USING RADAR, MOST OF WHICH WERE NOT REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE REGULATIONS. CARGO SHIPS CAN BE QUITE LARGE AND TRAVEL AT SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF 20KT, AND WERE REQUIRED TO BROADCAST AIS SIGNALS, SO THEIR BEHAVIOR WAS RELATIVELY EASY TO ASSESS. FEW CARGO VESSELS TRAVELED 10KT OR LESS FOR AN ENTIRE TRANSIT THROUGH THE SMA. THUS, WE OBSERVED AN APPARENT REACTION TO THE SPEED RESTRICTIONS IN THE SMA, BUT DID NOT OBSERVE STRICT COMPLIANCE. RECENTLY THE US COAST GUARD HAS BEGUN ISSUING SPEEDING CITATIONS TO VESSELS THAT HAVE BEEN RECORDED BLATANTLY DISREGARDING THE SPEED RESTRICTIONS IN SMAS. WE APPLAUD THESE EFFORTS AND SUSPECT THAT IF THE EFFORT CONTINUES CONSISTENTLY IT WILL ENCOURAGE COMPLIANCE. OUR DATA SUGGEST THAT AIS TRAFFIC LEVELS WERE RELATIVELY CONSTANT (1.2 TRANSITS/HR) AROUND THE CLOCK. FOR THIS PROJECT, WE CHOSE TO OPERATE THE RADAR UNIT DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS IN ORDER TO ASSESS VESSEL TYPE AND APPROXIMATE LENGTH FROM THE SHORE BASED PLATFORM. IN THE FUTURE, WE NEED TO ASSESS RADAR VESSEL TRAFFIC DURING ALL HOURS IN ORDER TO BETTER COMPARE IT TO AIS TRAFFIC. IN 2007, VIRGINIA PORTS WERE LISTED AS THE THIRD BUSIEST PORT ON THE U.S. ATLANTIC COAST FOR VESSEL CALLS. A LARGE PORTION OF THE VESSELS CALLS FOR THE PORT OF BALTIMORE ALSO ENTER AT CHESAPEAKE BAY. THE ADDITION OF COMMERCIAL BALTIMORE TRAFFIC AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND FISHING VESSELS NOT BROADCASTING AIS VERY LIKELY MAKES THE CHESAPEAKE BAY APPROACH ONE OF THE TWO BUSIEST COASTAL PORT APPROACHES AND MAY MAKE IT THE BUSIEST IN THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC. THIS PROJECT RAISES NUMEROUS QUESTIONS ABOUT VESSEL TRAFFIC PATTERNS, VESSEL SPEEDS, RISKS TO WHALES AND DATA INCORPORATED INTO MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING EFFORTS. THERE IS A DEFINITE NEED FOR BOTH LONGER REACHING SHIP RADAR DATA AND MORE DETAILED WHALE PRESENCE DATA IN THE MID ATLANTIC REGION, ESPECIALLY OFF ITS BUSIEST PORT. WITHOUT DATA ON WHALE PRESENCE, IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF RISK THAT THE VESSEL TRAFFIC PATTERNS PRESENT FOR WHALES AND ON HOW INSTALLATIONS OF OFFSHORE WIND AND OTHER ENERGY VENTURES MAY AFFECT WHALES AND SHIPS. THIS PROJECT BRINGS INTO QUESTION THE USE OF AIS DATA ALONE AS AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF LARGE VESSEL TRAFFIC IN COASTAL REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WITH HIGH FISHING AND MILITARY TRAFFIC. IN VIRGINIA, DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS, AIS DATA REPRESENT A MAXIMUM OF TWO THIRDS, AND, AS LITTLE AS ONE HALF, OF THE LARGE VESSEL (&GT;65 FEET) TRAFFIC IN THE CHESAPEAKE BAY APPROACH. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE ACCURATE DETERMINATION OF VESSEL SIZE WHEN USING RADAR. A MOBILE RESEARCH PLATFORM WITH THE CAPABILITY OF ASSESSING RADAR TARGETS ON THE WATER OR AN OFFSHORE PLATFORM WITH A GREATER RANGE AND USE OF NIGHT VISION TECHNOLOGY MAY PROVIDE SOLUTIONS.  2012 IEEE.,AIS; CHESAPEAKE BAY; HAMPTON ROADS; RADAR; RIGHT WHALE SEASONAL MANAGEMENT AREA; SHIP TRAFFIC; SHIPPING; VIRGINIA,AIS; CHESAPEAKE BAY; HAMPTON; MANAGEMENT AREAS; SHIP TRAFFIC; VIRGINIA; BROADCASTING; BUOYS; DRILLING PLATFORMS; FISHERIES; FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION; HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION; LAWS AND LEGISLATION; OCEANOGRAPHY; OFFSHORE STRUCTURES; RADAR; SHIPS; SOFTWOODS; SPEED; TRAFFIC SIGNALS; WATERWAY TRANSPORTATION; FISHING VESSELS,,,,,,(2008) VESSEL CALLS AT US PORTS SNAPSHOT, 2007, , USDOT.

A NEED TO IMPROVE THE COASTAL OIL SPILL RESPONSE CAPABILITY WAS THEREFORE IDENTIFIED EARLY IN RELATION TO THE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE GOLIAT OIL FIELD, LOCATED IN THE SOUTH WESTERN PART OF THE BARENTS SEA, AND CONSEQUENTLY A STRATEGY WAS DEVELOPED. ENI NORGE AND ENI E&P JOINED FORCES TO SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS STRATEGY THROUGH THE COSPIP JIP AND A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ISSUED WITH STATOIL, THE ONLY LICENSE PARTNER IN GOLIAT. MORE THAN 30 RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WERE CARRIED OUT IN ORDER TO GET NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND KNOWLEDGE THAT COULD IMPROVE THE COASTAL OIL SPILL CAPABILITY. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH ADOPTED IN THE JIP. FOCUS HAS BEEN ON COASTAL CLEAN UP AND PROTECTION, STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT, EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE IMPROVEMENT, SPILL DETECTION AND MONITORING TECHNOLOGIES, LOGISTICS AND LOCAL OPERATIONS AS WELL AS ON THE STUDY OF BEHAVIOUR OF OIL SPILLED IN PROXIMITY OF THE COAST. THE MAIN OBTAINED RESULTS, WHICH WILL BE APPLIED IN THE GOLIAT OIL SPILL PREPAREDNESS, ARE PRESENTED. THIS PAPER ALSO ILLUSTRATES HOW THE STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT AND THE COMMUNICATION STRATEGY WERE CARRIED OUT SUCCESSFULLY DURING THE PROJECT, MAINLY THROUGH THE PARTICIPATION AT PUBLIC MEETINGS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN OIL SPILL PREPAREDNESS WEBSITE, WITH THE AIM TO TRANSFER THE ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE BY MEAN OF ARTICLES AND VIDEO PRESENTATION TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND GENERAL PUBLIC.

OPENING UP NEW MARKETS FOR CANADAS OIL SANDS, SHALE AND OFF SHORE GAS RESOURCES WILL REQUIRE AN EXPANSION OF THE PIPELINE SYSTEM IN NORTHERN BRITISH COLUMBIA, ALBERTA AND THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES. WHILE NAVIGATING THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS CAN BE A FORMIDABLE HURDLE, A FAR GREATER CHALLENGE IS HOW PROPONENTS MANAGE THE PROCESS OF BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS AND CONSULTING WITH AFFECTED ABORIGINAL COMMUNITIES. FAILING TO EARN ABORIGINAL SUPPORT FOR PROPOSED PROJECTS CAN BE A SHOW STOPPER. EXPLORATION OF NEW BASINS IN CANADA, DRIVEN BY INCREASED DEMAND FOR ENERGY IN ASIA, MAY COMPETE WITH OTHER LAND USES AND CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHTS AND PRACTICES OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. PUBLIC, MEDIA AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE TO NEW PIPELINES IS OFTEN LEAD BY THE REACTION OF IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. THE TASK OF IDENTIFYING THE SOCIAL RISKS TO A PROJECT, UNDERSTANDING THE ENGAGEMENT PROCESS, FULFILLING THE REGULATORY CONSULTATION REQUIREMENTS OF DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS, BALANCING IMPACTS WITH BENEFITS, MANAGING ISSUES AND RESOLVING DISPUTES, COMMUNICATING WITH THE PUBLIC AND MEDIA EFFECTIVELY ALL REQUIRE IMPROVED SKILLS AND APPROACHES. THE PAPER SURVEYS THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT EXPERIENCE AND DIFFERENCES IN APPROACHES FOR RECENTLY PROPOSED MAJOR ARCTIC GAS AND WESTERN OIL PIPELINE PROJECTS, AS WELL AS PIPELINES TO SERVICE LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS EXPORT FACILITIES ON THE PACIFIC NORTH COAST, PROVIDING PRACTICAL INSIGHTS WITH POSSIBLY INTERNATIONAL APPLICATION. UTILIZING DECISION AND RISK ANALYSIS AND SCENARIO PLANNING METHODOLOGIES, APPLIED TO DEVELOPMENT OF AN ABORIGINAL ENGAGEMENT AND CONSULTATION STRATEGY, THE PAPER EXAMINES HOW MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENTS IN NEW PIPELINES CAN BE BETTER SECURED BY INTEGRATING STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT INTO A PROJECTS RISK MANAGEMENT DESIGN. WITH GREATER PRECISION AND IMPROVED APPROACHES PROPONENTS CAN EFFECTIVELY MANAGE SOCIAL RISKS, REDUCE STAKEHOLDER CONFLICT AND ASSOCIATE PROJECT UNCERTAINTIES.

GOLF COURSES, ORNAMENTAL, ATLANTIC GARDENS AND SWIMMING POOLS ARE THE MOST STRIKING ARTEFACTS OF THIS TRANSFORMATION, THREATENING THE LOCAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEMS AND EXACERBATING WATER SCARCITY. IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE, URBAN LANDSCAPE IRRIGATION IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT FROM A RESOURCE MANAGEMENT POINT OF VIEW. THIS PAPER ADOPTS URBAN REMOTE SENSING TOWARDS A TARGETED MAPPING APPROACH USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES AND HIGHRESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGERY (WORLDVIEW 2) TO GENERATE GIS READY INFORMATION FOR URBAN WATER CONSUMPTION STUDIES. SWIMMING POOLS, VEGETATION AND AS A SUBGROUP OF VEGETATION TURF GRASS ARE EXTRACTED AS IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF WATER CONSUMPTION. FOR IMAGE ANALYSIS, THE COMPLEX NATURE OF URBAN ENVIRONMENTS SUGGESTS SPATIAL SPECTRAL CLASSIFICATION, I.E. THE COMPLEMENTARY USE OF THE SPECTRAL SIGNATURE AND SPATIAL DESCRIPTORS. MULTISCALE IMAGE SEGMENTATION PROVIDES MEANS TO EXTRACT THE SPATIAL DESCRIPTORS NAMELY OBJECT FEATURE LAYERS WHICH CAN BE CONCATENATED AT PIXEL LEVEL TO THE SPECTRAL SIGNATURE. THIS STUDY ASSESSES THE VALUE OF OBJECT FEATURES USING DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES AND AMOUNTS OF LABELED INFORMATION FOR LEARNING. THE RESULTS INDICATE THE BENEFIT OF THE SPATIAL SPECTRAL APPROACH IF COMBINED WITH APPROPRIATE CLASSIFIERS LIKE TREE BASED ENSEMBLES OR SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES, WHICH CAN HANDLE HIGH DIMENSIONALITY.

THE 2011 EARTHQUAKE OFF THE PACIFIC COAST OF TOHOKU OCCURRED AT 14:46 JAPAN STANDARD TIME ON MARCH 11. ALL THE NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS IN THE EASTERN JAPAN ALONG WITH THE PACIFIC OCEAN COASTLINE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SHUTDOWN ACCORDING TO THE EARTHQUAKE GROUND MOTION. IN 40 MINUTES, THE FIRST TSUNAMI STRUCK THE FUKUSHIMA DAI ICHI NUCLEAR POWER STATION. THE TSUNAMI HEIGHT WAS 15 M AT MAXIMUM WHICH WAS FAR BEYOND THE DESIGN TSUNAMI HEIGHT. IT CAUSED THE SUBMERGENCE IN SEAWATER OF THE EMERGENCY POWER SUPPLY AND SEAWATER SYSTEMS. IT RESULTS IN THE STATION BLACK OUT AND LOSS OF ULTIMATE HEAT SINK IN THE UNITS 1 4 OF THE FUKUSHIMA DAI ICHI NUCLEAR POWER STATION. TO MAKE THE MATTER WORSE, HYDROGEN EXPLOSION IN THE REACTOR BUILDING TOOK PLACE, WHICH HAS EVERY EFFORT FOR RECOVERY ALL FAIL. CONSEQUENTLY THE REACTOR CORES WERE SERIOUSLY DAMAGED AND THE NUCLEAR FUEL MELTED WHICH LEAD TO THE RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL RELEASE TO THE ENVIRONMENT. EVIDENCES CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INDICATE NO SEISMIC STRUCTURAL FAILURE OF SAFETY SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS. THE TSUNAMI AND THE STATION BLACKOUT GAVE INTENSE IMPACT ON THE NUCLEAR SYSTEM RESULTING IN THE SEVERE ACCIDENT. IN RESPONSE TO THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE FUKUSHIMA DAI ICHI NPS ACCIDENT [2], THE SAFETY MARGINS EVALUATION AND SAFETY ENFORCEMENT OF THE NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS ARE NECESSARY IMMEDIATELY. THE NUCLEAR SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE ROBUSTNESS FOR THE BEYOND DESIGN BASIS CONDITIONS AND RESILIENCE IN CASE THAT THE MULTIPLE LEVELS OF DEFENSE LINES ARE DETERIORATED. ACCORDINGLY, THE BEST PERFORMANCE IN NUCLEAR SAFETY IS TO BE ACHIEVED.

ONE MAJOR SOURCE OF VARIABILITY IS THE SEA LAND BREEZE CIRCULATION THAT OCCURS DURING PERIODS OF PEAK ENERGY DEMAND. THE SEA BREEZE FRONT, DRIVEN BY THE THERMAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WARM LAND AND RELATIVELY COOLER OCEAN DURING HOT SUMMER AFTERNOONS, PROPAGATES INLAND AND UNDER WEAK ATMOSPHERIC BOUNDARY LAYER WIND CONDITIONS CAN AFFECT MUCH OF THE STATE. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE OFFSHORE COMPONENT OF THE SEA BREEZE CIRCULATION. A LARGE ZONE OF SUBSIDENCE OVER THE COASTAL OCEAN, AND SUBSEQUENT DIVERGENCE NEAR THE SURFACE, IS KNOWN TO OCCUR IN UNISON WITH THE INLAND PROPAGATING SEA BREEZE FRONT. RU COOLS UNIQUE MONITORING AND MODELING ENDEAVORS ARE FOCUSED ON EXPLORING THE DETAILS OF THESE OFFSHORE DYNAMICS OF THE SEA BREEZE CIRCULATION AND ITS DEVELOPMENT DURING BOTH COASTAL UPWELLING AND NON UPWELLING EVENTS. A CASE STUDY FROM THE AUGUST 13, 2012 IS ANALYZED IN THIS PAPER; COASTAL UPWELLING RESULTED FROM PERSISTENT SOUTH TO SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS FOR DAYS. IN ADDITION, A SEA BREEZE FRONT FORMED IN THE AFTERNOON, PROPAGATING INLAND AND PRODUCING A ZONE OF WEAK WINDS OFFSHORE THAT COINCIDES WITH THE TARGETED AREA OF OFFSHORE WIND DEVELOPMENT. MODEL RESULTS, USING UNIQUE DECLOUDED SATELLITE SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE DATA, ARE VALIDATED INSHORE AGAINST WEATHER RADAR AND OFFSHORE AGAINST COASTAL OCEAN RADAR (CODAR). SMALL SCALE OFFSHORE WIND VARIABILITY IS RESOLVED AND VERIFIED IN THE MODEL, WHICH WILL BE CRITICAL FOR PRODUCING ACCURATE AND RELIABLE OFFSHORE WIND RESOURCE ASSESSMENTS AND PRECISE OPERATIONAL FORECASTS FOR THE FUTURE.  2012 IEEE.,AIR SEA INTERACTION; ATMOSPHERIC MODELING; COASTAL PROCESSES; HF RADAR; OFFSHORE WIND; SATELLITE SST; SEA BREEZE; UPWELLING; WEATHER RADAR; WRF,AIR SEA INTERACTIONS; ATMOSPHERIC MODELING; COASTAL PROCESS; HF RADARS; OFFSHORE WINDS; SATELLITE SST; SEA BREEZE; UPWELLING; WRF; ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE; COASTAL ENGINEERING; DIGITAL STORAGE; ENERGY MANAGEMENT; METEOROLOGICAL RADAR; WIND POWER; OCEANOGRAPHY,,,,,,SKAMAROCK, W.C., KLEMP, J.B., DUDHIA, J., GILL, D.O., BARKER, D.M., WANG, W., POWERS, J.G., (2008) A DESCRIPTION OF THE ADVANCED RESEARCH WRF VERSION 3, 113P. , NCAR TECHNICAL NOTE TN 468+STR; JEDLOVEC, G., LAFONTAINE, F., SHAFER, J., RIGNEY, M., VAZQUEZ, J., ARMSTRONG, E., CHIN, M., (2010) USE OF HIGH RESOLUTION SST DATA FOR OPERATIONAL APPLICATIONS, , OCEAN SCIENCE WORKSHOP, PORTLAND; EKMAN, V.W., ON THE INFLUENCE OF THE EARTHS ROTATION ON OCEAN CURRENTS (1905) ARKIV.

THE GEOGRAPHY AND HISTORIC, LINEAR DEVELOPMENT OF ITS CAPITAL ON THE SOUTH TAWARA ATOLL MEAN THAT MANY KEY PUBLIC ASSETS ARE AT RISK FROM IMPACTS OF COASTAL EROSION AND THUS VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE CHANGE EFFECTS. AN ADAPTATION PROJECT STARTED IN 2003, WHICH INCLUDED DEVELOPING A MEANS OF ASSESSING COASTAL VULNERABILITY AND A PROCESS FOR PROACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE COAST. GUIDELINES OFFERING ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL COASTAL ENGINEERING METHODS WERE PROVIDED, AND PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THESE GUIDELINES WAS DEMONSTRATED AT SELECTED HIGH RISK PILOT SITES IN 2006 2010. APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY FOR INCREASING RESILIENCE WAS SHOWN THROUGH APPLICATION OF SIMPLE BUT EFFECTIVE TOOLS TO IDENTIFY AND SELECT ADAPTATION OPTIONS; RECOGNITION THAT CUSTOMARY RESPONSES INGRAINED OVER LIFETIMES WILL NOT BE CHANGED BY A SHORT TERM PROJECT; AND USE OF TRIED AND TESTED QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS TO TRADITIONAL CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES.

THE COMPRESSOR STATION IS PART OF THE GRYAZOVETS VYBORG GAS TRUNKLINE, WHICH WILL IMPROVE GAS SUPPLY IN RUSSIAS NORTHWEST AND FEED GAS TO EUROPE VIA THE NORD STREAM PIPELINE. THE MODELING SUBSYSTEM WILL COMPRISE AN ENGINEERING AND OPERATIONS SIMULATOR FOR OFFLINE SIMULATION AND A GAS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR MONITORING AND OPTIMIZING COMPRESSOR STATION OPERATIONS TO MEET OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NORD STREAM PIPELINE. THE PROJECT WILL RESULT IN THE MOST GEOGRAPHICALLY EXTENSIVE GAS TRANSMISSION SIMULATION MODELS EVER IMPLEMENTED BY MSI KENNY AND WILL BE BASED ON AN EXPANDED VERSION OF THE MODELING SOFTWARE USED BY THE NORD STREAM PIPELINE. THIS WILL ENABLE GAZPROM TO OPTIMIZE COMPRESSOR OPERATIONS WHILE ACHIEVING OPTIMAL PIPELINE INVENTORY AND OPERATING CONDITIONS. THE 366 MW PORTOVAYA COMPRESSOR STATION WILL SECURE GAS TRANSMISSION ACROSS THE 1200 KM LENGTH OF THE NORD STREAM PIPELINE AND ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL COMPRESSOR STATIONS.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00320188,,PLGJA,,,ENGLISH,PIPELINE GAS J.,NOTE,SCOPUS

LAURDERDALE, FL, UNITED STATES,ON OCTOBER 2, 2005, THE NEW YORK STATE CERTIFIED PASSENGER VESSEL ETHAN ALLEN HEELED TO PORT, CAPSIZED, AND LATER SANK AS IT ROUNDED CRAMER POINT ON LAKE GEORGE. TRAGICALLY, 20 PASSENGERS DIED AND SEVERAL OTHERS WERE INJURED. A NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (NTSB) INVESTIGATION ENSUED WHICH FOCUSED ON ASPECTS OF THE INTACT STABILITY AND SEAKEEPING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VESSEL. THIS ARTICLE INCLUDES A NEW EXAMINATION OF THE NTSBS LIGHTSHIP DETERMINATION AND AN INTERESTINGLY FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS OF THE TURN INDUCED HEEL AND ITS IMPACT ON THE RESULTING CAPSIZE. THE ACCIDENT HAS RESULTED IN A RENEWED FOCUS ON HOW THE STABILITY OF SMALL PASSENGER VESSELS IS REGULATED.

OF NORTH TEXAS, DENTON, TX 76203 5017, UNITED STATES,THIS STUDY FOCUSED ON HOUSEHOLD EVACUATION DECISIONS AND DEPARTURE TIMING FOR HURRICANE IKE. THE DATA WERE CONSISTENT WITH AN ABBREVIATED FORM OF THE PROTECTIVE ACTION DECISION MODEL IN WHICH FEMALE GENDER, OFFICIAL WARNING MESSAGES, HURRICANE EXPERIENCE, COASTAL LOCATION, AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CUES WERE HYPOTHESIZED TO PRODUCE PERCEIVED STORM CHARACTERISTICS, WHICH IN TURN, WOULD PRODUCE EXPECTED PERSONAL IMPACTS. FINALLY, THE LATTER, TOGETHER WITH PERCEIVED EVACUATION IMPEDIMENTS, WOULD DETERMINE EVACUATION DECISIONS AND DEPARTURE TIMING. HOWEVER, THERE WERE FEWER SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF PERCEIVED STORM CHARACTERISTICS AND MORE SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF EXPECTED PERSONAL IMPACTS AND EVACUATION DECISIONS THAN HYPOTHESIZED. ALSO CONTRARY TO HYPOTHESIS, FEMALE GENDER, PERCEIVED STORM CHARACTERISTICS, OFFICIAL WARNINGS, AND HURRICANE EXPERIENCE PREDICTED DEPARTURE TIMES. HOWEVER, AS EXPECTED, EVACUATION RATES DECLINED WITH DISTANCE FROM THE COAST; UNLIKE HURRICANE RITA 3 YEARS EARLIER, THERE WAS A VERY LOW LEVEL OF SHADOW EVACUATION IN INLAND HARRIS COUNTY. FINALLY, MOST HOUSEHOLDS EVACUATED 2 DAYS BEFORE LANDFALL, BETWEEN THE TIME OF THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER HURRICANE WATCH AND WARNING, AND EVACUATED OVERWHELMINGLY DURING THE DAYTIME HOURS.  2012 AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS.,EVACUATION; HURRICANES; RISK MANAGEMENT; TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT,COASTAL LOCATIONS; DECISION MODELS; DEPARTURE TIME; EVACUATION; HURRICANE RITA; LOW LEVEL; SOCIAL CUES; TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT; WARNING MESSAGES; RISK MANAGEMENT; STORMS; HURRICANES; DECISION MAKING; DISASTER MANAGEMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL CUE; GENDER ROLE; HOUSEHOLD SURVEY; HURRICANE IKE 2008; HYPOTHESIS TESTING; PERCEPTION; PUBLIC ATTITUDE; RISK ASSESSMENT; TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT; WARNING SYSTEM,,,,,,ARLIKATTI, S., LINDELL, M.K., PRATER, C.S., PERCEIVED STAKEHOLDER ROLE RELATIONSHIPS AND ADOPTION OF SEISMIC HAZARD ADJUSTMENTS (2007) INT.

AS A RESULT OF THE EARTHQUAKE AND SUBSEQUENT TSUNAMI, APPROXIMATELY 23,000 GG (23,000,000 T) OF DISASTER DEBRIS WAS GENERATED, WITH MORE THAN 12 MILLION M3 OF TSUNAMI DEPOSITS LEFT IN THE FLOODED AREA. THE GEOTECHNICAL UTILIZATION OF THE SOIL FRACTION IN THE DISASTER DEBRIS AND TSUNAMI DEPOSITS HAS PRESENTED A HUGE CHALLENGE TO GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERS SINCE (1) THE CLEARANCE OF DEBRIS AND TSUNAMI DEPOSITS IS AN URGENT TASK WHICH MUST BE COMPLETED WITHIN A FEW YEARS AND (2) ALTHOUGH A LARGE AMOUNT OF WASTE MIXED SOIL CAN BE USED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW EMBANKMENTS AND LEVEES TO PROTECT THE COAST FROM FUTURE TSUNAMIS, THEIR GEOTECHNICAL PROPERTIES HAVE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIATIONS. THIS PAPER SUMMARIZES THE CURRENT STATUS ON THE GENERATION, CLEARANCE, AND TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF DISASTER DEBRIS AND TSUNAMI DEPOSITS FROM GEOTECHNICAL AND GEO ENVIRONMENTAL VIEWPOINTS. IN ADDITION, THE ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING DATA ON SOIL AND GROUNDWATER QUALITY CONDUCTED OVER THE AFFECTED AREA IS BRIEFLY REVIEWED. THE RESULTS OF SEVERAL WIDE AREA MONITORING EFFORTS CONDUCTED BY DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS INDICATE THAT NO SIGNIFICANT SOIL OR GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION HAS OCCURRED. HOWEVER, THE LOCALIZED CONTAMINATION NEAR INDUSTRIAL PLANTS WHERE TOXIC CHEMICALS LEAKED DUE TO THE EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI NEEDS TO BE CAREFULLY TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION DURING FUTURE REVIVAL AND REDEVELOPMENT WORKS. ANOTHER SERIOUS GEO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE IS THE MANAGEMENT OF THE RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION OF SURFACE SOILS CAUSED BY THE ACCIDENT AT THE FUKUSHIMA FIRST NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.

MATERIAL IS FIRST DELIVERED TO THE M2500 AND AN OVERBAND MAGNET ON THE FEED CONVEYOR REMOVES ANY FERROUS MATERIAL WHICH IS SUBSEQUENTLY DISCHARGED TO A SKIP. ONE OF THE MAJOR BENEFITS OF THE PROGRADE SCREEN IS THE INDEPENDENT WASHING SYSTEM WHICH ENSURES IT IS ENTIRELY SEPARATED FROM THE VIBRATION OF THE SCREEN MINIMIZING THE RISK OF PLANT FAILURE. AS MATERIAL ENTERS THE INTEGRATED ROTOMAX RX8OR LOG WASHER ATTRITION IS APPLIED THROUGH SYNCHRONIZED ROTATION OF THE DUAL SHAFTS WHICH ARE FITTED WITH HIGHLY WEAR RESISTANT HIGH CAST CHROME PADDLES MOUNTED IN A FAN ARRANGEMENT.

NOMOS CONSISTS OF SEVERAL SUBSYSTEMS: POMOS, GALATA, SHKORPILOVTCI, BULSEAL AND BULARGO. POMOS IS AN OBSERVING SYSTEM LOCATED IN THE PORTS (14 MEASURING SITES, 45 INSTRUMENTS, 14 WEATHER AND SEASTATE PARAMETERS), DESIGNED TO PROVIDE WEATHER AND SEA STATE OPERATIONAL INFORMATION FOR THE AREAS OF MAJOR BULGARIAN PORTS (VARNA, BURGAS AND BALCHIK), INTENDED TO SECURE SAFETY SHIPPING IN PORTS, CANALS AND BAYS. GALATA IS A PLATFORM WHICH PROVIDES OPEN SEA REAL TIME METEOROLOGICAL AND OCEANOGRAPHIC INFORMATION FROM 24 SENSORS, MEASURING 31 MAJOR OCEANOGRAPHIC AND METEOROLOGICAL PARAMETERS. SHKORPILOVTCI IS A COASTAL OCEANOGRAPHIC STATION COMPILING: WEATHER STATION, SEA LEVEL GAUGE, UV RADIATION SENSOR AND RECORDING DOPPLER CURRENT PROFILER WITH WAVE SENSOR. BULSEAL IS A NETWORK OF SEA LEVEL STATIONS INCLUDING FOUR HISTORICAL SITES, MEASURING SEA LEVEL FROM MORE THAN 80 YEARS. BULARGO IS A SET OF ARGO FLOATS DEPLOYED IN THE FRAME IF THE PROJECT SUPPORTED BY BULGARIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE FUND, MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, YOUTH AND SCIENCE. THE PURPOSE OF THE BULARGO PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A NEW NATIONAL MARINE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE FOR IN SITU OBSERVATION IN BLACK SEA BASED ON AUTONOMOUS PROFILING FLOATS AS A BULGARIAN COMPONENT OF THE EURO ARGO NETWORK. THESE SUBSYSTEMS COLLECT REAL TIME DATA USING VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS AND SENSORS PLACED AT DIFFERENT STRATEGIC LOCATIONS. ALL INSTRUMENTS ARE CONNECTED TO COMMUNICATION SYSTEM VIA INTRANET WHICH PROVIDES DIRECT ACCESS TO THE SENSORS. THE MEASURED DATA ARE TRANSMITTED TO THE CENTRAL COLLECTING SYSTEM, WHERE THE INFORMATION IS PROCESSED AND STORED IN DATABASE. ACCESS TO DATABASE IS THROUGH INTERNET/INTRANET WITH THE HELP OF BROWSERS. ACTUAL DATA IS CONTROLLED BY DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AN CAN BE DISPLAYED ON THE COMPUTER SCREENS USING REPORT SERVER SUPPORTING THEREBY NEEDS OF DIFFERENT GROUP OF USERS. NEXT FUTURE DEVELOPMENT WILL BE TO INSTALL NEW SYSTEM WHICH INCLUDES FIVE OPEN SEA MOORINGS EQUIPPED WITH METEOROLOGICAL AND OCEANOGRAPHIC SENSORS AS WELL AS WITH SEISMOMETERS AS A MAIN COMPONENT OF A MARINE HAZARDS EARLY WARNING SYSTEM. THE MAIN GOAL OF NOMOS IS TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BULGARIAN BLACK SEA COAST AND EEZ, AND THE MAIN TASK IS TO PROVIDE OPERATIONAL INFORMATION FOR THE NEEDS OF: NATIONAL SECURITY, CIVIL PROTECTION, SEARCH AND RESCUE, GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES, PORT AUTHORITIES, SHIPPING, MARINE INDUSTRY, FISHERY AND AQUACULTURE, TOURIST INDUSTRY, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, COAST PROTECTION, OIL SPILLS COMBAT AND OTHER INTERESTED. NOMOS REAL TIME DATA IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SOURCES OF MULTI PARAMETER OPERATIONAL INFORMATION IN THE BLACK SEA WHICH WILL SERVE FOR MONITORING, VERIFICATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF MODEL RESULTS AND FORECASTS AS WELL AS FOR COLLECTING LONG TIME SERIES OF DATA NEEDED FOR CLIMATIC RESEARCH, MARINE PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY. FREE REAL TIME DATA ACCESS AND DEVELOPED USER FRIENDLY WEB AND WAP INTERFACES MADE THE SYSTEM USEFUL NOT ONLY FOR SCIENCE, MARINE INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES BUT ALSO FOR GENERAL PUBLIC, ESPECIALLY FOR YACHTSMEN AND WINDSURFERS.  2012 IEEE.,BLACK SEA; OBSERVING SYSTEMS; OCEANOGRAPHIC DATA MANAGEMENT; OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHY,ARGO FLOAT; BLACK SEA; CIVIL PROTECTION; CLIMATIC RESEARCH; COAST PROTECTION; COMPUTER SCREENS; DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM; DOPPLER CURRENT PROFILERS; EARLY WARNING SYSTEM; GENERAL PUBLICS; GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY; IN SITU OBSERVATIONS; LEVEL GAUGE; LOCAL AUTHORITIES; LONG TIME SERIES; MAIN TASKS; MARINE INDUSTRY; MARINE RESEARCH; MEASURING SITES; METEOROLOGICAL PARAMETERS; MINISTRY OF EDUCATION; MODEL RESULTS; MULTIPARAMETERS; NATIONAL SECURITY; OBSERVING SYSTEMS; OCEANOGRAPHIC DATA; OCEANOGRAPHIC INFORMATIONS; OCEANOGRAPHIC SENSORS; OCEANOGRAPHIC STATIONS; OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHY; PORT AUTHORITIES; PROFILING FLOAT; RADIATION SENSORS; REAL TIME DATA ACCESS; REAL TIME ASSESSMENT; REAL TIME DATA; SEA STATE; SEA STATE PARAMETERS; SEARCH AND RESCUE; STRATEGIC LOCATIONS; SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS; TOURIST INDUSTRY; USER FRIENDLY; WAVE SENSORS; WEATHER STATIONS; COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS; ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION; HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS; INFORMATION MANAGEMENT; INSTRUMENTS; OCEAN CURRENTS; OIL SPILLS; SEA LEVEL; SENSORS; SHORE PROTECTION; ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION; MARINE POLLUTION,,,,,,POPOV, V., ANTSYFEROV, S.M., BELBEROV, Z.K., MASSEL, S., DYNAMICAL PROCESSES IN COASTAL REGIONS (1990) RESULTS OF THE KAMCHIA INTERNATIONAL PROJECT, P. 190. , PUBL.

SHIH H.H.,REAL TIME CURRENT AND WAVE MEASUREMENTS IN PORTS AND HARBORS USING ADCP,2012,PROGRAM BOOK OCEANS 2012 MTS/IEEE YEOSU: THE LIVING OCEAN AND COAST DIVERSITY OF RESOURCES AND SUSTAINABLE ACTIVITIES,,, 6263642,,,,,HTTP://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URL?EID2 S2.0 84866705644&PARTNERID40&MD5C91301114BC4965A51012B57FDCF078B,OCEANTECH CONSULTING, POTOMAC, MD, UNITED STATES,SHIH, H.H., OCEANTECH CONSULTING, POTOMAC, MD, UNITED STATES,BOTH WAVES AND CURRENTS RANK HIGHLY BY USER GROUPS AMONG OCEANOGRAPHIC OBSERVATION VARIABLES. REAL TIME INFORMATION OF THESE VARIABLES IS ESPECIALLY USEFUL FOR VESSEL OPERATORS AND RECREATIONAL USERS IN AND AROUND PORTS, HARBORS AND BAYS. OTHER APPLICATIONS INCLUDE COASTAL LAND MANAGEMENT, ECOSYSTEM PROTECTION AND RESTORATION, MITIGATION OF COAST HAZARDS AND MARINE ACCIDENTS, FORECAST, WARNING AND SEARCH AND RESCUE. THE U.S. NATIONAL OCEAN SERVICE (NOS) OF NOAA MAINTAINS AND OPERATES A PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY REAL TIME SYSTEM (PORTS) IN THE NATIONS MAJOR PORTS AND HARBORS. TYPICAL HYDROLOGICAL PARAMETERS MEASURED INCLUDE WATER LEVELS, CURRENTS, CONDUCTIVITY, WATER TEMPERATURE AND DEPTH. WAVE INFORMATION IS OF INTEREST TO PORTS USERS, BUT HAS ONLY BEEN OBTAINED RECENTLY IN A FEW PORTS SITES. HOWEVER, CONTINUED STUDY AND LABORATORY AND FIELD TESTING OF VARIOUS WAVE MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENTS AND REAL TIME DATA TELEMETRY TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED SINCE 2003. THESE INSTRUMENTS AND TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDE TRIAXYS DIRECTIONAL WAVE BUOY, DIRECTIONAL WAVERIDER BUOY, AND ACOUSTIC DOPPLER CURRENT PROFILERS, UNDERWATER ACOUSTIC MODEM AND LINKS WITH RADIO AND SATELLITE. EXTRACTION OF NON DIRECTIONAL WAVE INFORMATION FROM NEAR SHORE TIDE GAUGES (E.G., AIR ACOUSTIC GAGE AND MICROWAVE RADAR ALTIMETER) HAS ALSO BEEN STUDIED. AMONG THESE, ACOUSTIC DOPPLER CURRENT PROFILERS (OR ADCP) ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST SINCE THEY ARE KEY INSTRUMENT IN PORTS FOR CURRENT MEASUREMENTS. IT IS ECONOMICALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY ATTRACTIVE TO MEASURE BOTH CURRENTS AND WAVES. THIS PAPER SUMMARIZES THE NOS OPERATIONAL SYSTEM AND RESULTS OF TWO NOS FIELD STUDIES OF REAL TIME ADCP SYSTEMS FOR CURRENT AND WAVE MEASUREMENTS IN PORTS AND HARBORS. THE OPERATIONAL SYSTEM INCLUDES BOTTOM MOUNTED ADCP WITH BURIED CABLE IN THE NAVIGATION CHANNEL. LATER, THE SYSTEM WAS REPLACED BY A U.S. COAST GUARD AID TO NAVIGATION (ATON) BUOY MOUNTED ADCP WITH TELEMETRY RADIO. SHORE BASED HORIZONTAL ADCPS ARE ALSO BEING USED FOR REAL TIME CURRENT MEASUREMENT. THE TWO STUDIES (IN 2003 AND 2008) USED DIFFERENT ADCP INSTRUMENTS AND DATA TELEMETRY TECHNIQUES. THE ADCPS USED WERE RDI WORKHORSE SERIES AND AWAC (WITH INTERNAL PROCESSOR). THE UNDERWATER ACOUSTIC MODEMS USED WERE MODELS UWM1000 AND UWM2000H BY LINKQUEST. THE DATA TELEMETRY TECHNOLOGIES USED WERE FREEWAVE 900MHZ SPREAD SPECTRUM LINE OF SIGHT RADIOS, AND IRIDIUM SATELLITE.  2012 IEEE.,ADCP; BAYS; COASTAL OCEAN OBSERVATION; HARBORS; PORTS; REAL TIME; SATELLITE; UNDERWATER ACOUSTIC MODEM,ADCP; BAYS; COASTAL OCEAN; PORTS; REAL TIME; UNDERWATER ACOUSTIC MODEM; BUOYS; DOPPLER EFFECT; ELECTRIC CURRENT MEASUREMENT; INSTRUMENT TESTING; INSTRUMENTS; IRIDIUM; MICROWAVE ACOUSTICS; MODEMS; OCEANOGRAPHY; RADIO LINKS; RADIO NAVIGATION; REAL TIME SYSTEMS; SATELLITES; TELEMETERING EQUIPMENT; UNDERWATER ACOUSTICS; WATER LEVELS; PORTS AND HARBORS,,,,,,(2001) PHASED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR U.S. IOOS, OCEAN, , OCEAN.

THESE EVENTS HAVE ALSO RAISED AWARENESS OF THE NEED FOR RISK ASSESSMENT FOR LOCAL (E.G. SUBMARINE AND SUBAERIAL LANDSLIDE GENERATED) AND NEAR FIELD TSUNAMIS (THOSE THAT CAN IMPACT A COASTAL COMMUNITY LESS THAN AN HOUR AFTER GENERATION). ALTHOUGH EXISTING TSUNAMI WARNING SYSTEMS SUCH AS DART (DEEP OCEAN ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING OF TSUNAMIS) ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT PROVIDING AN ASSESSMENT AND WARNING OF FAR FIELD TSUNAMI EVENTS, COMPARABLE SYSTEMS DO NOT CURRENTLY EXIST FOR LOCAL AND NEAR FIELD EVENTS. TSUNAMI INUNDATION MODELS CAN PREDICT COASTAL RUN UP YET THE LACK OF WAVE AMPLITUDE, DIRECTION, AND SHAPE DATA WITHIN A FEW MINUTES OF A NEAR FIELD TSUNAMI EVENT LIMITS THE INFORMATION NEEDED FOR WARNING POPULATIONS AT RISK. THE OCEAN NETWORKS CANADA (ONC) OBSERVATORY, COMBINING THE VENUS AND NEPTUNE CANADA CABLED NETWORKS, IS THE WORLDS LARGEST REGIONAL OCEAN OBSERVATION SYSTEM WITH OVER 900 KM OF ELECTRO OPTIC CABLE. THE ONC OBSERVATORY, LOCATED OFF THE EAST AND WEST COASTS OF VANCOUVER ISLAND SPANS THE JUAN DE FUCA TECTONIC PLATE AND EDGE OF THE OVERRIDING NORTH AMERICAN PLATE, A REGION KNOWN TO PRODUCE MEGA THRUST EARTHQUAKES. THE ONC OBSERVATORY HAS AN EXTENSIVE TSUNAMI MONITORING SYSTEM OF BOTTOM PRESSURE RECORDERS USED TO PROVIDE HIGH RESOLUTION TSUNAMI DATA FOR MODELING FAR FIELD TSUNAMIS IN COASTAL REGIONS [1]. SINCE THE START UP OF OPERATIONS OF THE NEPTUNE CANADA NETWORK IN 2009, THE CAPABILITY OF THE SYSTEM HAS ALREADY BEEN PROVEN BY THE HIGH PRECISION OF THE BOTTOM PRESSURE RECORDERS THAT MONITORED THE PASSAGE OF THE TSUNAMI WAVES GENERATED BY THE SAMOAN, CHILEAN, AND JAPANESE EARTHQUAKE EVENTS. THE OBSERVATORY HAS AN EXTENSIVE SENSOR NETWORK COVERING A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCH THEMES AND PROVIDES STANDARDIZED CONNECTION PORTS FOR GUEST INSTRUMENTS. THE SYSTEM IS SUPPORTED BY A SOPHISTICATED DATA MANAGEMENT AND ARCHIVING SYSTEM, WHICH PROVIDES DATA ACQUISITION, ARCHIVING, PROCESSING AND VISUALIZATION FROM SOURCES ACROSS THE OBSERVATORY. WITH THE BASE CORE TECHNOLOGIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR TSUNAMI WARNING SYSTEM RESEARCH, THE ONC OBSERVATORY IS AN IDEAL SITE FOR THE TEST AND EVALUATION OF NEAR FIELD TSUNAMI DETECTION TECHNOLOGIES. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES HOW THIS UNIQUE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE USED TO FACILITATE INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION, COMBINING NEW TECHNOLOGIES, CONCEPTS AND ALGORITHMS TO CREATE AN INTERNATIONAL NEAR FIELD TSUNAMI RESEARCH FACILITY TO DEVELOP, EVALUATE, AND TEST WARNING TECHNOLOGIES AND SOLUTIONS FOR AT RISK POPULATIONS.  2012 IEEE.,EARLY WARNING SYSTEM; NEPTUNE CANADA; NORTHEAST PACIFIC; OCEAN OBSERVING; TSUNAMI; VENUS,EARLY WARNING SYSTEM; NEPTUNE; NORTHEAST PACIFIC; OCEAN OBSERVING; VENUS; BUILDINGS; DATA VISUALIZATION; EARTHQUAKES; INFORMATION MANAGEMENT; INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION; INTERPLANETARY FLIGHT; OBSERVATORIES; OCEANOGRAPHY; RESEARCH; SENSOR NETWORKS; TSUNAMIS,,,,,,THOMSON, R., FINE, I., RABINOVICH, A., MIHALY, S., DAVIS, E., HEESEMANN, M., OBSERVATION OF THE 2009 SAMOA TSUNAMI BY THE NEPTUNE CANADA CABLED OBSERVATORY: TEST DATA FOR AN OPERATIONAL REGIONAL TSUNAMI FORECAST MODEL (2011) GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, 38, PP.

THIS PHENOMENON IS REVEALED VIOLENTLY AND OCCASIONALLY AS GRAVITATIONAL MOVEMENTS OF THE GROUND AND CAN CAUSE MATERIAL OR HUMAN LOSSES. THEIR PREDICTION IS DIFFICULT; HOWEVER IT IS BASIC FOR THE PROPER COASTAL MANAGEMENT AND THE CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF EROSION RISKS. THERE ARE SEVERAL MODELS OF THE COASTAL CLIFF RECESSION PROCESSES. FROM THE STOCHASTIC TYPE MODELS BASED ON HISTORICAL EROSION EVENTS, TO THE THEORETICAL MODELS AS DESCRIBED BY EIKONAL OR BOUSSINESQ EQUATIONS. IN THIS WORK AN INTERMEDIATE SOLUTION IS ADOPTED (PROCESS RESPONSE MODEL), SUCH AS MODELS BASED ON SIMPLIFIED BALANCE OF FORCES AS TRIGGER MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN THE EROSION OF THE ROCKS. THIS MODEL FITS THE MARINE DYNAMICS: SEA LEVEL CHANGES, TIDAL RANGE AND WAVE TRANSFORMATION; ALONG WITH THE EVOLUTION OF THE LAND: THE SLOPE OF THE SURF ZONE, EROSION AND ROCK FALLS. SO FAR THESE MODELS HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO SMALL SLOPE CLIFFS, SINCE ITS NUMERICAL STABILITY AND THE PROPAGATION OF ERRORS ARE UNKNOWNS. FOR THESE REASONS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GENERIC MODEL THAT REPRODUCES THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF A CLIFF 2D PROFILE (PLATFORM, BEACH AND SLOPE) CONSISTING ON SEMI CONSOLIDATED HETEROGENEOUS MATERIALS, IS PRESENTED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPUTATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION, THE STUDY OF DIFFERENT NUMERICAL RESOLUTION TECHNIQUES AND THE PRODUCED ERRORS, ARE ALSO EXPOSED AND ANALYSED.  2010 CIMNE (UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE CATALUNYA).

AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF URBAN MODERNIZATION, PEOPLE PUT GREAT EFFORT IN BUILDING DAMMING HYDRAULIC PROJECT, PROMOTING REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE COASTLINE, FISH FARMING AND SO ON. AS RESULT OF THIS, THE RUNOFF OF RIVER DOWNSTREAM SUFFERS FROM A SUDDEN FALL. WHEN THE TIDE RISES, THE SEAWATER GOES UP ALONG THE RIVER WAY AND ENTERS INTO INLAND, MAKING THE BOUNDARY OF FRESH WATER AND SEAWATER MOVE INLAND. ALONG WITH THE DROUGHT AND OVER EXPLOIT OF UNDERGROUND WATER RECENT YEARS, UNDERGROUND FUNNEL GROUP COMES INTO BEING AT DIFFERENT DEGREE WHERE WATER CAN NOT BE IMMEDIATELY REPLENISHED, SO AS TO ACCELERATE THE FORMATION AND EXPANSION OF UNDERGROUND FUNNELS, RESULTING IN MUCH WORSE SEAWATER INTRUSION CONDITION. THE NECESSARY MEASURES TO RELIEVE INWELLING DAMAGE ALONG THE COAST IN QINHUANGDAO IS TO MANAGE COASTAL HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING SCIENTIFICALLY, TO REGULATE UNDERGROUND MINING CORRECTLY, TO ESTABLISH MULTIPLE WATER SOURCE CHANNELS, TO INCREASE EFFORT IN STORING RAINWATER, TO SUPPLY THE UNDERGROUND WATER WITH RAIN, TO RECYCLE SEWAGE, TO DESALINIZE SEAWATER AND TO REPLENISH FRESH WATER AQUIFER IN TIME.,CONTROL MEASURES; PRESENT SITUATION; QINHUANGDAO; SEAWATER INTRUSION,AQUIFER; COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT; DROUGHT; GROUNDWATER; MINING; RAINWATER; RIVER; RUNOFF; SEAWATER; TIDE; BOHAI BAY; CHINA; HEBEI,,,,,,GUO, Z., HUANG, Y., COMPREHENSIVE STUDY ON SEAWATER INTRUSION (2003) HYDROLOGY, 23 (3), PP. 10 15; TANG, X., ZUO, F., WANG, H., FLUCTUATION IN ADDITION TO THE GROUND WATER OVER PUMPING (2008) JOURNAL OF SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT, 8 (1), PP. 92 99; YANG, Y., GAO, S., XIE, Y., ASSESSMENT AND CONTROL COUNTERMCASURES OF SEAWATER INTRUSION HAZARD ON QINGHUANGDAO REGION (2008) THE CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOLOGICAL HAZARD AND CONTROL, 19 (3), PP. 139 143; LIANG, X., LIU, H., XING, H., SEAWATER INTRUSION AND CONTROL MEASURES OF COASTAL AREAS IN FUNING, HEBEI PROVINCE (2010) PLANNING AND DESIGN OF WATER RESOURCES, 5, PP. 30 33; CHINA OCEAN ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY BULLETIN, , HTTP://WWW.SOA.GOV.CN/SOA/HYGBML/HJGB/A011001INDEX_1.HTMM; XIE, Y., (2009) DYNAMIC STUDY OF SEAWATER INTRUSION DISASTER IN QINHUANGDAO, PP. 100 103. , GEOLOGICAL TEAM OF MINERAL AND HYDROLOGICAL ENGINEERING IN QINHUANGDAO, HEBEI, 2009 STAFF PAPERS COLLECTION; ZUO, W., YANG, Y., ZHANG, Z., BUDGET ANALYSIS OF GROUNDWATER IN THE YANGDAIHE PLAIN BY ARCVIEW GIS (2009) GROUND WATER, 31 (3), PP. 11 14; ZUO, W., YANG, Y., DONG, J., THE NUMERICAL STUDY FOR SEAWATER INTRUSION IN YANGHE AND DAIHE COASTAL PLAIN OF QINHUANGDAO CITY (2009) JOURNAL OF NATURAL RESOURCES, 24 (12), PP. 2088 2095; ZHANG, W., LIU, W., GUO, J., GEOLOGICAL HAZARDS OF THE SEAWATER INTRUSION AND ITS CONTROL MEASURES IN QINHUANGDAO CITY, HEBEI PROVINCE (2010) THE CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOLOGICAL HAZARD AND CONTROL., 21 (4); ZHANG, X., BU, X., KONG, F., THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE UPON AREA PRECIPITATION OF QINHUANGDAO (2007) ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT., 32 (8), PP. 62 64; SHI, H., LI, X., A SIMULATING MODEL OF POLLUTANT DIFFUSION IN COASTAL WATER BASED ON CELLULAR AUTOMATA (2011) DISASTER ADVANCES, 3 (4), PP. 297 300; HYO, C., CHOI, D.S., CHOI, S.M., METEOROLOGICAL CONDITION AND ATMOSPHERIC BOUNDARY LAYER INFLUENCED UPON TEMPORAL CONCENTRATIONS OF PM1, PM2. 5 AT A COASTAL CITY, KOREA FOR YELLOW SAND EVENT FROM GOBI DESERT (2011) DISASTER ADVANCES, 3 (4), PP. 309 315; KUANG, W., LIU, J., LU, D., (2011) PATTERN OF IMPERVIOUS SURFACE CHANGE AND ITS EFFECT ON WATER ENVIRONMENT IN THE BEIJING TIANJIN TANGSHAN METROPOLITAN AREA, 66 (11), PP. 1486 1496; ZHAO, Y., WATER SUPPLY AND DEMAND ANALYSIS IN QINHUANGDAO CITY (2010) HEILONGJIANG WATER CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, 38 (2), PP. 57 159; ZHAO, Y., THE VARIATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF RAINFALL IN QINHUANGDAO (2011) GROUND WATER, 33 (2), PP. 137 138; LIANG, Y., CHEN, J., CHEN, L., MECHANISM AND APPLICATION OF WATER INJECTING HYDRAULIC CURTAIN STOPPING SEAWATER INTRUSION (2009) JOURNAL OF YANGTZE RIVER SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE, 26 (10), PP. 133 136,YANG, G.; DEPARTMENT OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING, NORTHEAST PETROLEUM UNIVERSITY, HEBEI STREET NO550, QINHUANGDAO CITY, HEBEI PROVINCE, CHINA,,,,,,,,0974262X,,,,,ENGLISH,DISASTER ADV.,ARTICLE,SCOPUS

IN THE FUTURE IT MAY NOT BE SUSTAINABLE TO CONTINUE TO DEFEND ALL THE LOCATIONS ON THE COAST THAT PRESENTLY BENEFIT FROM DEFENCES. ADAPTATION CAN HELP DELIVER MORE SUSTAINABLE SHORELINE MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS THAT BETTER MANAGE THE RISKS TO THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FUNCTION OF THE COAST. PLANNING FOR ADAPTATION WILL REQUIRE PREPARING COASTAL COMMUNITIES FOR FUTURE CHANGE AND WILL INVOLVE BUILDING IN FLEXIBILITY RATHER THAN CLOSING OFF FUTURE SOLUTIONS. A NUMBER OF CASE STUDIES ARE PRESENTED WHICH EXEMPLIFY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF ADAPTATION. THE PAPER DEMONSTRATES HOW FUTURE REVIEWS OF SHORELINE MANAGEMENT PLANS (SMPS) COULD PROMOTE MORE ADAPTIVE MEASURES LINKED TO THE COASTAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT AREAS THAT WILL FEATURE IN THE NEXT REVISION OF LAND USE PLANS. THE FUTURE CHALLENGES TO DELIVERING MORE ADAPTIVE SOLUTIONS ARE CONSIDERED BY LOOKING AT WHERE ADAPTATION MAY BE NEEDED, WHAT MORE ADAPTIVE APPROACHES MAY LOOK LIKE, AND WHAT THE BARRIERS TO IMPLEMENTATION ARE. ONE CRITICAL AREA IS THE GREATER ENGAGEMENT OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THE PAPER SHOWS HOW THE RECENT COASTAL PATHFINDER PROJECTS ARE TACKLING THIS ISSUE. THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THESE PROJECTS WILL BE INVALUABLE IN ROLLING OUT ADAPTIVE SOLUTIONS TO OTHER AREAS IN THE FUTURE. SUCH SOLUTIONS CAN BE PROGRESSED WITHIN THE POLICIES LAID DOWN IN THE CURRENT SMPS BUT SHOULD BE UPDATED IN FUTURE SMP REVIEWS AS NEW INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE BECOMES AVAILABLE.,ENVIRONMENT; MANAGEMENT; SEA DEFENCES,ADAPTIVE APPROACH; ADAPTIVE SOLUTION; COASTAL CHANGE; COASTAL COMMUNITIES; ENGLAND; ENVIRONMENT; FUTURE CHALLENGES; LAND USE PLAN; LOCAL COMMUNITY; SEA DEFENCE; SHORELINE MANAGEMENT; MANAGEMENT; SHAPE MEMORY EFFECT; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT; ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT; COASTAL ENGINEERING; COASTAL PROTECTION; COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING; SHORELINE CHANGE; SUSTAINABILITY; ENGLAND; UNITED KINGDOM; WALES,,,,,,(2003) NO ADVERSE IMPACT: A TOOLKIT FOR COMMON SENSE FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT, , HTTP://WWW.FLOODS.ORG/NOADVERSEIMPACT/NAI_TOOLKIT_2003.PDF, ASFPM (ASSOCIATION OF STATE FLOOD PLAIN MANAGERS), (ACCESSED 27/07/2012)., ASFPM, MADISON, WI, USA.

SUCCESSFUL ENGAGEMENT REQUIRES A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF ADAPTATION A CHALLENGE WHEN IT MAY MEAN ANYTHING FROM AN ENGINEERING INTERVENTION TO A STATE OF MIND. THIS CHALLENGE IS INCREASED BY THE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS WHOSE INVOLVEMENT IS ESSENTIAL RESIDENTS, STATUTORY AGENCIES AND INTEREST GROUPS, BUT ALSO VISITORS WHO SUPPORT THE COASTAL ECONOMY. THE JURASSIC COAST PATHFINDER PROJECT HAS EXPLORED THESE AND OTHER ISSUES WITH SIX DIVERSE COMMUNITIES IN DORSET AND EAST DEVON. ALL HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON: IF SHORELINE MANAGEMENT PLAN POLICIES ARE IMPLEMENTED, THEY WILL FACE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THEIR SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FABRIC. OVERCOMING SCEPTICISM ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT PROVED TO BE A SIGNIFICANT HURDLE AT THE OUTSET. HAVING OVERCOME THIS, DEVELOPING IDEAS ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT ADAPT PROVED RELATIVELY EASY.

ONE POTENTIAL ETIOLOGY TO EXPLAIN THEIR SYMPTOMS INCLUDED FORMALDEHYDE; HOWEVER, FORMALDEHYDE LEVELS IN THESE OCCUPIED TRAILERS WERE UNKNOWN. THE OBJECTIVES OF OUR STUDY WERE TO IDENTIFY FORMALDEHYDE LEVELS IN OCCUPIED TRAILERS AND TO DETERMINE FACTORS OR CHARACTERISTICS OF OCCUPIED TRAILERS THAT COULD AFFECT FORMALDEHYDE LEVELS. A DISPROPORTIONATE RANDOM SAMPLE OF 519 FEMA SUPPLIED TRAILERS WAS IDENTIFIED IN LOUISIANA AND MISSISSIPPI IN NOVEMBER 2007. WE COLLECTED AND TESTED AN AIR SAMPLE FROM EACH TRAILER FOR FORMALDEHYDE LEVELS AND ADMINISTERED A SURVEY. FORMALDEHYDE LEVELS AMONG ALL TRAILERS IN THIS STUDY RANGED FROM 3 PARTS PER BILLION (PPB) TO 590 PPB, WITH A GEOMETRIC MEAN (GM) OF 77 PPB [95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI): 70 85; RANGE: 3 590 PPB]. THERE WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN FORMALDEHYDE LEVELS BETWEEN TRAILER TYPES (P < 0.01). THE GM FORMALDEHYDE LEVEL WAS 81 PPB (95% CI: 72 92) AMONG TRAVEL TRAILERS (N 360), 57 PPB (95% CI: 49 65) AMONG MOBILE HOMES (N 57), AND 44 PPB (95% CI: 38 53) AMONG PARK MODELS (N 44).

IN PROMOTING AN ACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT AND ACCOMMODATING THE VARIOUS LEARNING METHODS OF OUR STUDENTS, WE ARE IN NEED OF ENGAGING, HANDS ON TOOLS FOR LECTURE AND SUPPLEMENTAL LABS ON RENEWABLE ENERGY. TO ADDRESS THIS NEED, A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF FACULTY MEMBERS AND STUDENTS FROM THE ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS IN THE COLLEGE ARE PARTICIPATING IN A COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH PROJECT INVOLVING COGENERATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY. THE RESEARCH PROJECT, MOBILE ELEMENTAL POWER PLANT (MEPP), ALLOWS STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN A CAPSTONE PROJECT ON CROSS DISCIPLINARY TEAMS, PROVIDING EACH OF THEM A MEANS TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND ABILITIES IN DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, AND FABRICATION OF A FINAL PRODUCT. THE OVERALL MEPP TEAM IS COMPRISED OF TWENTY THREE DIVERSE STUDENTS FROM FOUR TECHNOLOGY DISCIPLINES: ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY (EET), DESIGN GRAPHICS ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY (DGET), MECHANICAL ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY (MET), AND MANUFACTURING ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY (MFET), UNDER THE AUSPICES OF FOUR FACULTY ADVISORS. THE LARGE GROUP IS BROKEN DOWN INTO FIVE SUB TEAMS WITH STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH OF THE DISCIPLINES. THE STUDENTS ARE GIVEN THE FREEDOM TO BE INNOVATIVE IN THEIR SUBSYSTEM DESIGNS WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT EACH INDEPENDENT DESIGN MUST BE INTEGRATED INTO A FULLY OPERATIONAL SYSTEM. THE SUB TEAMS ARE CONCERNED WITH ENVELOPE, BUDGET, TIME MANAGEMENT, COORDINATION OF ACTIVITIES, AND TEAM DYNAMICS. THE SUB TEAMS MUST ALSO WORK TOGETHER AND FUNCTION AS ONE LARGE TEAM WITH A COMMON GOAL. IN THE PAST, MULTIDISCIPLINARY ENGINEERING TEAMS HAVE BEEN FORMED WITH LITTLE SUCCESS DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN OUR PROGRAM EXPECTATIONS FOR CAPSTONE PROJECTS. IT WAS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE FACULTY ADVISEMENT AND SUPPORT ACROSS DISCIPLINES. THE CAPSTONE PROCESS, LEARNING OUTCOMES, GRADING CRITERIA AND COURSEWORK VARY BETWEEN OUR PROGRAMS. THIS RESEARCH EFFORT WILL GIVE ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY FACULTY THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE AND TO DOCUMENT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY ENGINEERING TEAMS AND TO DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES FOR FUTURE MULTIDISCIPLINARY ENGINEERING PROJECTS. THE OUTCOMES OF THIS STUDY WILL HELP US TO DETERMINE THE VIABILITY OF COORDINATING FUTURE MULTIDISCIPLINARY ENGINEERING PROJECTS THROUGH STUDENT ASSESSMENT AND TO ASSIST IN SETTING COMMON GOALS AND CREATING GUIDELINES FOR MULTIDISCIPLINARY CAPSTONE PROJECTS. A RUBRIC WILL BE USED FOR ASSESSMENT OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN DESIGN REVIEWS AND PROJECT PRESENTATIONS. STUDENT SURVEYS WILL ASSIST IN EVALUATING THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE FOR STUDENTS PARTICIPATING ON A MULTIDISCIPLINARY PROJECT. THEY WILL BE COMPARED TO STUDENT SURVEYS FROM PROGRAM SPECIFIC PROJECTS.

IT IS NOW WIDELY RECOGNIZED THAT A BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF THE PUBLICS AWARENESS AND CONCERN ABOUT RISKS IS OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO OUTLINE EFFECTIVE RISK COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES. MODELS SUCH AS RISK INFORMATION SEEKING AND PROCESSING ADDRESS THIS EVOLUTION BY CONSIDERING THE PUBLICS NEEDS AND ITS INFORMATION SEEKING BEHAVIOR WITH REGARD TO RISK INFORMATION. THIS STUDY BUILDS UPON EARLIER INFORMATION SEEKING MODELS AND FOCUSES ON THE EMPIRICAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INFORMATION SEEKING BEHAVIOR AND THE CONSTRUCTS OF RISK PERCEPTION, PERCEIVED HAZARD KNOWLEDGE, RESPONSE EFFICACY, AND INFORMATION NEED IN THE CONTEXT OF COASTAL FLOOD RISKS. SPECIFIC FOCUS IS GIVEN TO THE MEDIATING ROLE OF INFORMATION NEED IN THE MODEL AND TO THE DIFFERENCES IN INFORMATION SEEKING BEHAVIOR BETWEEN PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY RESIDENTS. BY MEANS OF A STRUCTURED ON LINE QUESTIONNAIRE, A CROSS SECTIONAL SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT IN THE CITY OF OSTEND, ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE PLACES TO COASTAL FLOODING ON THE BELGIAN COAST. THREE HUNDRED THIRTEEN RESPONDENTS PARTICIPATED IN THE SURVEY. PATH ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT INFORMATION NEED DOES NOT ACT AS A MEDIATOR IN CONTRAST TO RISK PERCEPTION AND PERCEIVED KNOWLEDGE. IN ADDITION, IT IS SHOWN THAT RISK PERCEPTION AND PERCEIVED HAZARD KNOWLEDGE ARE HIGHER FOR PERMANENT THAN TEMPORARY RESIDENTS, LEADING TO INCREASED INFORMATION SEEKING BEHAVIOR AMONG THE FORMER GROUP. IMPLICATIONS FOR RISK COMMUNICATION ARE DISCUSSED.  2012 SOCIETY FOR RISK ANALYSIS.,COASTAL FLOOD RISK; INFORMATION SEEKING BEHAVIOR; PATH ANALYSIS; RISK COMMUNICATION; RISK PERCEPTION,COASTAL FLOODING; COASTAL FLOODS; EMPIRICAL RELATIONSHIPS; FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT; INFORMATION NEED; INFORMATION SEEKING; INFORMATION SEEKING BEHAVIORS; ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE; PATH ANALYSIS; RISK COMMUNICATION; RISK INFORMATION; COMMUNICATION; FLOOD CONTROL; HAZARDS; INFORMATION RETRIEVAL; INFORMATION SCIENCE; REGRESSION ANALYSIS; RISK PERCEPTION; SURVEYS; PUBLIC RISKS; ATTITUDINAL SURVEY; COASTAL ZONE; FLOODING; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; HUMAN BEHAVIOR; INFORMATION SYSTEM; PATH ANALYSIS; PREFERENCE BEHAVIOR; PUBLIC ATTITUDE; QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY; RESIDENT POPULATION; RISK ASSESSMENT; RISK PERCEPTION; ALGORITHM; ARTICLE; ATTITUDE; BELGIUM; CROSS SECTIONAL STUDY; DISASTER; DISASTER PLANNING; FEMALE; FLOODING; HUMAN; INFORMATION PROCESSING; INFORMATION SEEKING; MALE; PERCEPTION; QUESTIONNAIRE; RISK; RISK ASSESSMENT; ALGORITHMS; ATTITUDE; BELGIUM; CROSS SECTIONAL STUDIES; DATA COLLECTION; DISASTER PLANNING; DISASTERS; FEMALE; FLOODS; HUMANS; INFORMATION SEEKING BEHAVIOR; MALE; PERCEPTION; QUESTIONNAIRES; RISK; RISK ASSESSMENT; BELGIUM; OSTEND; WEST FLANDERS,,,,,,SCHANZE, J., A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT RESEARCH (2007) FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT RESEARCH FROM EXTREME EVENTS TO CITIZENS INVOLVEMENT, PP. 1 10. , SCHANZE J (ED).

SPACE ANALOGS ARE REQUIRED AS MUCH AS EVER TODAY AS ASTRONAUTS AND SCIENTISTS DEVELOP NEW TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES FOR EXPLORATION, WHILE WORKING TO ADDRESS EVOLVING MISSION OBJECTIVES FROM LOW EARTH ORBIT TO DEEPSPACE EXPLORATION. THIS STUDY EXAMINES COORDINATED HUMAN AND ROBOTIC EXPLORATION AT THE AQUARIUS UNDERWATER HABITAT OFF OF THE COAST OF KEY LARGO, FLORIDA, IN SUPPORT OF THE NEEMO 15 (NASA EXTREME ENVIRONMENT MISSION OPERATIONS) PROGRAM. THE EXPLORATION SCHEME PRESENTED IN THIS WORK FUSES (1) ROBOTIC PRECURSORMISSIONS AS A MEANS OF REMOTE SENSING DATA COLLECTION; (2) CROWDSOURCING TO PROCESS IMMENSE AMOUNTS OF DATA TO IDENTIFY KEY TARGETS OF INTEREST THAT MIGHT BE MISSED IN THE TIGHT CYCLE OF MISSION OPERATIONS; AND (3) HUMAN EXPLORATION TO EXAMINE LOCATIONS DIRECTLY UP CLOSE AND COLLECT PHYSICAL SAMPLES THAT REQUIRE INVOLVED SAMPLING TECHNIQUES.

INTERSTATE AVE., PORTLAND, OR 97227, UNITED STATES,HIGHWAY STORM WATER RUNOFF REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF DISSOLVED COPPER TO SURFACE WATERS. IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT EVEN LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF DISSOLVED COPPER CAN BE TOXIC TO MANY AQUATIC ORGANISMS. IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST OF THE UNITED STATES, RECENT RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON THE EFFECTS OF LOW LEVEL COPPER EXPOSURE TO SALMONIDS LISTED AS THREATENED OR ENDANGERED UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT (ESA). IN LIGHT OF THESE RECENT STUDIES, INCREASINGLY STRINGENT GUIDELINES FOR THE DISCHARGE OF HIGHWAY STORM WATER RUNOFF HAVE BEEN IMPOSED AS PART OF ESA ASSESSMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. ASSESSING FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT DISSOLVED COPPER CONCENTRATIONS IN STORM WATER PROVIDES A PRACTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR PREDICTING WHEN AND WHERE COPPER TOXICITY COULD BE PROBLEMATIC. A STORM WATER SAMPLING EFFORT WAS PERFORMED TO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF SITE LOCALE, TRAFFIC DENSITY, STORM HYDROLOGY, THE FIRST FLUSH EFFECT, AND WATER QUALITY PARAMETERS ON MEASURED DISSOLVED COPPER CONCENTRATIONS IN HIGHWAY STORM WATER RUNOFF. IN GENERAL, RUNOFF FROM URBAN/HIGH TRAFFIC SITES AND FIRST FLUSH SAMPLES EXHIBITED HIGHER COPPER CONCENTRATIONS THAN OTHER SAMPLES. INCREASED DISSOLVED COPPER CONCENTRATIONS WERE HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH BOTH DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC) AND ALKALINITY. HOWEVER, MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODELING SUGGESTS THAT ONLY THE CORRELATION WITH DOC HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE CAUSATIVE. THESE FINDINGS WILL HELP INFORM STATE AND FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCIES REGARDING THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH ELEVATED COPPER CONCENTRATIONS AND POTENTIAL COPPER TOXICITY ARE MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR.  2012 AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS.,COPPER; HEAVY METALS; OREGON; RUNOFF; STORMWATER MANAGEMENT,AQUATIC ORGANISMS; COPPER CONCENTRATION; COPPER EXPOSURE; COPPER TOXICITY; DISSOLVED COPPER; DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON; ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT; FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION; HIGHLY CORRELATED; LOW CONCENTRATIONS; MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSIONS; OREGON; PACIFIC NORTHWEST; SALMONIDS; STORM WATER RUNOFF; STORMWATER MANAGEMENTS; STORMWATERS; TRAFFIC DENSITIES; TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS; WATER QUALITY PARAMETERS; CONSERVATION; DISSOLUTION; ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY; HEAVY METALS; LINEAR REGRESSION; RUNOFF; STORM SEWERS; STORMS; TOXICITY; TRANSPORTATION; WATER QUALITY; COPPER; AQUATIC ORGANISM; ASSESSMENT METHOD; CONCENTRATION (COMPOSITION); COPPER; DISSOLVED LOAD; DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTOR; ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION; HYDROLOGY; POLLUTION EFFECT; POLLUTION EXPOSURE; RUNOFF; SALMONID; STORMWATER; TOXICITY; OREGON; PACIFIC COAST [NORTH AMERICA]; PACIFIC COAST [UNITED STATES]; UNITED STATES; SALMONIDAE,,,,,,ALLEN, H.E., HANSEN, D.J., THE IMPORTANCE OF TRACE METAL SPECIATION TO WATER QUALITY CRITERIA (1996) WATER ENVIRON.

BREAM ARE DEMERSAL SPAWNERS, WITH THE EGGS LAID IN A NEST EXCAVATED BY THE MALE AS IT CREATES A DEPRESSION IN A SANDY GRAVEL SUBSTRATE. TO BUILD THEIR NESTS, MALE BREAM EXPOSE BEDROCK AND GRAVEL BY USING THEIR TAILS TO REMOVE THE SURFACE LAYER. THE PRESENT STUDY, USING SIDESCAN SONAR AND SCUBA DIVING, EXTENDS THE KNOWN OCCURRENCE OF EXTENSIVE NESTING GROUNDS OFF THE WEST SUSSEX COAST TO THE ISLE OF WIGHT AND DORSET. THE NESTS ARE TYPICALLY CIRCULAR CRATERS 1 2M WIDE, AND 5 30CM IN DEPTH, WHICH CAN CLEARLY BE SEEN USING SIDESCAN SONAR AS GROUPS OF CIRCULAR DEPRESSIONS. SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF EGGS (1 2MM) ARE ATTACHED TO BARE ROCK IN THE CENTRE OF THESE STRUCTURES. ALL THE EGGS HATCH BY JULY. THE SPECIES IS VALUABLE AND PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO EXPLOITATION BY BOTH SPORT AND COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN DURING ITS NESTING SEASON. WITH NO MINIMUM LANDING SIZE AND NO PRESCRIPTION FOR TOTAL ALLOWABLE CATCH OR THE INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL FOR THE EXPLORATION OF THE SEA (ICES) STOCK ASSESSMENT, THEY ARE SUITABLE FOR PROTECTION UNDER SPATIAL PLANNING MEASURES, SUCH AS THROUGH THE USE OF MARINE PROTECTED AREAS (MPAS).,BLACK BREAM; ENGLISH CHANNEL; FISHERIES MANAGEMENT; SCUBA DIVING; SIDESCAN SONAR; SPAWNING; SPONDYLIOSOMA CANTHARUS,BLACK BREAM; ENGLISH CHANNEL; FISHERIES MANAGEMENT; SCUBA DIVING; SIDE SCAN SONAR; SPAWNING; SPONDYLIOSOMA CANTHARUS; GRAVEL; SONAR; FISHERY MANAGEMENT; FISHING COMMUNITY; MARINE PARK; MIGRATORY SPECIES; NEST SITE; NESTING BEHAVIOR; OVERWINTERING; PERCIFORM; SIDESCAN SONAR; SPAWNING GROUND; STOCK ASSESSMENT; ENGLISH CHANNEL; HYPEROGLYPHE POROSA; SPONDYLIOSOMA CANTHARUS,,,,,,ARKLEY, K., CASLAKE, R., (2004) SR568 OFF BOTTOM TRAWLING TECHNIQUES FOR THE SUSTAINABLE EXPLOITATION OF NONPRESSURE STOCKS IN CORNISH INSHORE WATERS, P. 89. , REPORT BY THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, PLYMOUTH FOR THE SEA FISH INDUSTRY AUTHORITY; BAUCHOT, M.L., HUREAU, J.C., SPARIDAE (1986) FISHES OF THE NORTH EASTERN ATLANTIC AND THE MEDITERRANEAN, 2, PP. 883 907. , IN: WHITEHEAD PJP, BAUCHOT ML, HUREAU JC, NIELSEN J AND TORTONESE E.

BEST PRACTICES SHOULD INVOLVE SOME FORM OF MONITORING PRIOR TO, DURING AND POST BEACH RE BUILDING. THE MOST FREQUENTLY APPLIED MONITORING TECHNIQUES FOR ITALIAN (AND MEDITERRANEAN) BEACHES ARE TOPOGRAPHIC AND BATHYMETRIC SURVEYS CARRIED OUT IN REGULAR TIME INTERVALS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND BEACH EVOLUTION. MORPHOLOGICAL STUDIES, BASED ON GRAINSIZE PROFILE ANALYSES, CAN INDICATE THE SEDIMENTARY EVOLUTION OF THE BEACH. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, SCUBA DIVING TECHNIQUES WERE EMPLOYED IN ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL SURVEY METHODS IN ORDER TO MONITOR TWO STUDY AREAS ALONG THE LIGURIAN COAST (NORTHWEST MEDITERRANEAN SEA): OSPEDALETTI AND GENOVA VERNAZZOLA. IN PARTICULAR, A DIVER OPERATED, COST EFFECTIVE CORING SYSTEM OBTAINED MARINE SEDIMENT CORES, AND VIDEO TRANSECTS AND INSPECTIONS GENERATED INFORMATION ON THE STATUS OF COASTAL DEFENCE STRUCTURES (E.G. GROYNES). USING THOSE METHODS, THE MAIN VERTICAL DISCONTINUITIES ALONG THE SUBMARINE BEACH WERE IDENTIFIED, AS WERE POINTS OF EROSION ON THE SUBMARINE PARTS OF GROYNES. SUCH INNOVATIVE TECHNIQUES PROVIDED DATA THAT ARE NOT EASILY ACHIEVABLE WITH TRADITIONAL MONITORING TECHNIQUES.

IT RECEIVES RUNOFF FROM A PARTIALLY URBANISED 55 KM 2 CATCHMENT IN WHICH FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IS PLANNED. AN INTEGRATED WATER CYCLE MANAGEMENT (IWCM) STRATEGY HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY WYONG COUNCIL TO PROTECT THE WETLAND BY REPLICATING THE PRE DEVELOPMENT HYDROLOGICAL REGIME. TO DATE THE STRATEGY HAS BEEN BASED ON THE DISTRIBUTED COLLECTION, STORAGE AND HARVESTING OF URBAN STORMWATER IN A SERIES OF STORAGE BASINS CONNECTED VIA A PIPE NETWORK. THE BASIN OPERATIONS USE STORAGE, RE USE AND OVERFLOWS TO REPLICATE PRE DEVELOPMENT FLOWS. FUNDING CONSTRAINTS MEAN THAT THE CURRENT SCHEME EXCEEDS AVAILABLE FINANCIAL RESOURCES. HERE WE DESCRIBE FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS, ANALYSIS AND DESIGN THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN TO ACHIEVE A COST EFFECTIVE SCHEME THAT PROTECTS THE PORTERS CREEK WETLAND. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE CONSOLIDATION OF A SERIES OF DISTRIBUTED STORAGES AND WETLANDS INTO A CENTRAL REGIONAL STORAGE AND WETLAND WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE COST OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND AN ASSOCIATED RETICULATION NETWORK WHILE STILL MEETING ENVIRONMENTAL FLOW OBJECTIVES.,INTEGRATED WATER CYCLE MANAGEMENT; STORMWATER HARVESTING; WATER QUALITY; WETLAND HYDROLOGY,ANALYSIS AND DESIGN; CURRENT SCHEMES; DISTRIBUTED STORAGE; ENVIRONMENTAL FLOW; FINANCIAL RESOURCES; FRESHWATER WETLANDS; FUNDING CONSTRAINTS; HYDROLOGICAL REGIME; PIPE NETWORKS; STORMWATERS; URBAN STORMWATER; WATER CYCLE MANAGEMENT; WETLAND HYDROLOGY; CATCHMENTS; COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS; HARVESTING; RUNOFF; STORMS; WATER QUALITY; WETLANDS,,,,,,PORTERS CREEK FLOOD STUDY (2009) FINAL REPORT, PREPARED FOR WYONG SHIRE COUNCIL, , CARDNO; PRECINCT 7A INTEGRATED WATER MANAGEMENT STRATEGY (2011) DRAFT FINAL REPORT, PREPARED FOR WYONG SHIRE COUNCIL, , CARDNO; (2007) WATER SENSITIVE URBAN DESIGN SOLUTIONS FOR CATCHMENTS ABOVE WETLANDS, , ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING, PREPARED FOR THE HUNTER CENTRAL COAST REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY; (2008) WARNERVALE WADALBA INTERGRATED WATER CYCLE MANAGEMENT SECTION, 94. , EDAW AECOM, PREPARED FOR WYONG SHIRE COUNCIL; (2010) DEVELOPMENT CONTROL PLAN CH 97 WSUD TECHNICAL GUIDELINES, PP. 1 7. , WYONG SHIRE COUNCIL,EVANS, N.; CARDNO (NSW/ACT) PTY LTD., 9, 203 PACIFIC HIGHWAY, ST LEONARDS NSW 2065, AUSTRALIA; EMAIL: NATHAN.EVANS@CARDNO.COM.AU,,MELBOURNE WATER;MONASH UNIVERSITY, CENTRE FOR WATER SENSITIVE CITIES,,7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WATER SENSITIVE URBAN DESIGN, WSUD 2012,21 FEBRUARY 2012 THROUGH 23 FEBRUARY 2012,MELBOURNE, VIC,90112,,9780858258952,,,,ENGLISH,WSUD INT.

IN THESE PLACES, PUBLIC OPINION, GOVERNMENT REGULATORY AGENCIES, A LACK OF SPACE FOR CO 2 INJECTION SITES AND FEW DEPLETED OIL AND GAS FIELDS AVAILABLE NECESSITATE THE APPLICATION OF ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO SEQUESTER CO 2 IN ORDER TO MITIGATE A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE 30 BILLION TONS OF CO 2 ANNUALLY RELEASED IN THE EARTHS ATMOSPHERE. THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF MULTIPLE RESERVOIR SIMULATIONS AND PARAMETRIC STUDIES FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEEPWATER SEDIMENTS LOCATED IN VARIOUS REGIONS OF THE GLOBE (PACIFIC OCEAN, ATLANTIC OCEAN, JAPAN SEA AND GULF OF MEXICO). SINCE NOT ALL REGIONS AND SEDIMENTS DEPOSITED BELOW 9,000 FEET OF OCEAN WATERS SEEM TO BE VIABLE TO PERMANENTLY STORE CO 2, THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE CRITICAL PARAMETERS THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED TO SUCCESSFULLY INJECT AND PERMANENTLY STORE LIQUID CO 2 IN DEEPWATER SUB SEABED SEDIMENTS. IN FACT, WHEN INJECTING LIQUID CO 2 THROUGH AN ULTRA DEEPWATER CONDUIT (INJECTION PRESSURIZED RISER) WITHIN THE FIRST FEW HUNDREDS OF SEDIMENTS, SEVERAL UNCERTAIN VARIABLES SUCH AS TEMPERATURE, SEDIMENT TYPE, SEDIMENT THICKNESS, PERMEABILITY, POROSITY AND CO 2 INJECTABILITY GREATLY INFLUENCE THE OVERALL INTEGRITY OF THE BUOYANT TRAP. VERY LONG TIME RESERVOIR SIMULATIONS (E.G. 250 YEARS) HAVE BEEN USED TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT DECISION AND UNCERTAIN VARIABLES ON THE BEHAVIOR AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE CO 2 PLUME WITHIN THE SEDIMENTS. ALSO, EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESPONSE SURFACE METHODOLOGIES HAVE BEEN USED TO QUANTIFY THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THE CRITICAL PARAMETERS AND TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL CONDITIONS FOR DEEPWATER SEDIMENTS CO 2 STORAGE. FINALLY, THE ESSENTIAL FINDINGS OF THE PAPER PROVIDE THE OFFSHORE AND CARBON SEQUESTRATION INDUSTRIES WITH A HIGH LEVEL MAPPING OF THE WORLDS OCEANS AND DEEP SEAS BEST CANDIDATES FOR CO 2 STORAGE IN DEEPWATER SEDIMENTS.

CURRENT SCHEMES REQUIRE ROUGHLY A THIRD OF A POWER PLANTS ENERGY FOR CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE AND PRESSURIZATION. THE PRODUCTION OF ENERGY FROM GEOPRESSURED AQUIFERS HAS EVOLVED AS A SEPARATE, INDEPENDENT TECHNOLOGY FROM THE SEQUESTRATION OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN DEEP, SALINE AQUIFERS. A GAME CHANGING NEW IDEA IS DESCRIBED HERE THAT COMBINES THE TWO TECHNOLOGIES AND ADDS ANOTHER: DISSOLUTION OF CARBON DIOXIDE INTO EXTRACTED BRINE WHICH IS THEN RE INJECTED. A SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATION OVER A RANGE OF CONDITIONS WAS PERFORMED TO EXPLORE THE BEST STRATEGY FOR THE COUPLED PROCESS OF CO 2 SEQUESTRATION AND ENERGY PRODUCTION. GEOLOGICAL MODELS OF GEOPRESSURED GEOTHERMAL AQUIFERS WERE DEVELOPED USING AVAILABLE DATA FROM STUDIES OF GULF COAST AQUIFERS.

ONE OF THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY IS TO INTRODUCE AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH BASED ON CIRCULAR STATISTICS FOR ASSESSING THE SEASONALITY OF THE EXTREME PRECIPITATION. CIRCULAR STATISTICS EXPLICITLY REFLECT THE SEASONAL PATTERN OF PRECIPITATION WITH MAXIMUM FREQUENCY OF THE TIMING OF DAILY AND MONTHLY MAXIMUMS. IN SOUTHERN KOREA, A DOMINANT FREQUENCY WAS IDENTIFIED IN EARLY JULY. THE TIMING OF THE MONTHLY MAXIMUM HAS BEEN DELAYED IN NORTHERN KOREA. IN THE CASE OF THE DAILY MAXIMUM, THE END OF JUNE IS THE PERIOD OF MOST INTENSE RAINFALL, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE EAST COAST NEAR GANGRUNG. A LONG TERM TEMPORAL VARIATION OF TIMED MONTHLY AND DAILY MAXIMUMS WAS INVESTIGATED BY A 30 YEAR MOVING AVERAGE FOR MAIN STATIONS. MONTHLY PEAK TIMES OF SEOUL AND GANGRUNG CONTINUOUSLY MOVED BACKWARD WHILE MONTHLY PEAK TIMES OF MOKPO AND BUSAN HAS MOVED FORWARD SINCE THE 1960S. THESE FEATURES COULD BE INFLUENCED BY INHERENT VARIATIONS IN THE EAST ASIAN MONSOON SYSTEM. GIVEN THE IDENTIFIED SPATIO TEMPORAL PATTERN, THIS STUDY WAS EXTENDED TO CHARACTERIZE REGIONAL PATTERNS OF EXTREME RAINFALL OVER KOREA. A NEW CONCEPT IN REGIONALIZATION PROCEDURES WAS DEVELOPED ON THE BASIS OF EXISTING APPROACHES THAT MAINLY UTILIZE SIMPLE MOMENTS OF DATA. IN THIS STUDY, THE K MEANS METHOD WAS INCORPORATED WITH THE TEMPORAL PATTERN OF THE EXTREME RAINFALLS IN ORDER TO BETTER CHARACTERIZE HYDROLOGIC PATTERNS FOR REGIONAL FREQUENCY ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS PROMISING FOR THE REGION IN TERM IMPROVING THE PHYSICAL UNDERSTANDING OF EXTREME RAINFALL.  2012 INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR HYDRO ENVIRONMENT ENGINEERING AND RESEARCH, ASIA PACIFIC DIVISION.,CIRCULAR STATISTICS; REGIONAL FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; SPATIO TEMPORAL ANALYSIS,DOMINANT FREQUENCY; EAST ASIAN MONSOON; EAST COAST; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; EXTREME RAINFALL; K MEANS METHOD; MAIN STATION; MAXIMUM FREQUENCY; MOVING AVERAGES; PEAK TIME; REGIONAL FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; REGIONAL PATTERN; SEASONAL PATTERNS; SEASONALITY; SOUTH KOREA; SPATIOTEMPORAL ANALYSIS; SPATIOTEMPORAL PATTERNS; SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIABILITY; TEMPORAL PATTERN; TEMPORAL VARIATION; WATERRESOURCE MANAGEMENT; WATER MANAGEMENT; RAIN; FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; LONG TERM CHANGE; MONSOON; PRECIPITATION (CLIMATOLOGY); PRECIPITATION INTENSITY; REGIONALIZATION; RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; SPATIOTEMPORAL ANALYSIS; WATER RESOURCE; MOKPO; PUSAN [PUSAN (ADS)]; PUSAN [SOUTH KOREA]; SEOUL [SOUTH KOREA]; SOUTH CHOLLA; SOUTH KOREA,,,,,,ACREMAN, M.C., SINCLAIR, C.D., CLASSIFICATION OF DRAINAGE BASINS ACCORDING TO THEIR PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS: AN APPLICATION FOR FLOOD FREQUENCY ANALYSIS IN SCOTLAND (1986) J.

GRAVEL BARRIER BEHAVIOUR DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS SUCH AS SEDIMENT PROPERTIES (POROSITY, PERMEABILITY, GRAINSIZE), GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND WAVE CLIMATE. SINCE OVERWASH PROCESSES ARE KNOWN TO CONTROL SHORT TERM GRAVEL BARRIER DYNAMICS AND LONG TERM BARRIER MIGRATION, THE DEVELOPMENT OF A ROBUST QUANTITATIVE METHOD TO DEFINE THE CRITICAL CONDITIONS LEADING TO GRAVEL BARRIER OVERWASHING IS IMPORTANT BOTH FOR SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. IT IS KNOWN THAT WHEN WAVE RUNUP EXCEEDS THE BARRIER CREST ELEVATION, THREE OUTCOMES ARE POSSIBLE: 1) INSIGNIFICANT MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGE, WHEN WAVE RUNUP JUST OVERTOPS THE BARRIER CREST AND FLOW VELOCITIES ARE VERY WEAK; 2) OVERTOPPING, RESULTING IN ACCRETION ON THE BARRIER CREST REGION AND BARRIER STABILISATION; AND 3) OVERWASHING, RESULTING IN EROSION, LOWERING OF THE CREST REGION AND ULTIMATELY TO BARRIER INUNDATION. THIS STUDY PROVIDES AN INSIGHT INTO THE CRITICAL CONDITIONS THAT DISTINGUISH THESE TWO POSSIBLE OUTCOMES AND TO THE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS THAT PROVIDE THE REQUIRED POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FEEDBACKS TO THE SEDIMENT DYNAMICS. IN ORDER TO DEFINE THE OVERWASH THRESHOLD CONDITION, AND TO PREDICT THE MORPHOLOGICAL OUTCOME OF PARTICULAR OVERWASH EVENTS, USE IS MADE HERE OF THE . OVERWASH POTENTIAL (. OP), DEFINED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WAVE RUNUP AND THE BARRIER CREST ELEVATION. TO MAKE EFFECTIVE USE OF . OP IT IS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY A RELIABLE RUNUP PREDICTOR.

THE TRANSPORT OF THESE CHEMICALS IN INTERNATIONAL BASINS IS A SUBJECT OF MAJOR INTEREST IN THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED BASINS. THE MASS OF ACTIVE MOLECULES OF THE PESTICIDES APPLIED IN THE COMOE BASIN (BVC) WAS EVALUATED USING THE AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS AND PESTICIDES FORMULATION. PESTICIDES DISTRIBUTION AND WATER RESOURCES VULNERABILITY TO THESE CHEMICALS WERE ALSO APPREHENDED IN THE BVC BY CONSIDERING AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES, CLIMATIC AND EDAPHIC PARAMETERS AND THE MASS APPLIED. PESTICIDES DISTRIBUTION FOLLOWED THE AGRICULTURAL SPECULATIONS WITHIN THE BASIN. A TOTAL OF 44 ACTIVE MOLECULES AND COPPER HYDROXIDE WERE RECORDED. THESE MOLECULES WERE GROUPED IN 22 FAMILIES. THE LAGOONS (38) AND SOUTH COMOE (32) REGIONS CONTAINING THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF ACTIVE MOLECULES SEEMED THE MOST EXPOSE TO PESTICIDES POLLUTION. APPROXIMATELY 644 T OF PESTICIDES WERE APPLIED TO THE AGRICULTURAL SPECULATIONS. ATRAZINE (17%), CARBOSULFAN (16%), CHLORPYRIPHOS ETHYL (12%) AND THE METOLACHLORE (10%) ACCOUNT FOR 55% OF THIS MASS. CARBOSULFAN (159 KG.HA 1), FOSETYL (52 KG.HA 1) AND PHENAMIPHOS (20 KG.HA 1) HAD THE HIGHEST APPLICATION INTENSITIES. THESE MOLECULES COULD CONTRIBUTE TO WATER RESOURCES DEGRADATION.  2012 EUROJOURNALS PUBLISHING, INC.,AGRICULTURE; COTE DIVOIRE; COMOE; PESTICIDES; TRANSBOUNDARY CACHMENT; VULNERABILITY,,,,,,,ANDERSON, A.

IN RECENT YEARS, THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS FACED BY MONITORING AGENCIES HAVE LED TO THE INITIATION OF NETWORK REDUCTION PROCEDURES IN THE SPACE DOMAIN (I.E., THE REDUCTION OF THE NUMBER OF STATIONS WITHIN A NETWORK). IN THIS REGARD, THE DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING APPROACH (DPA) CAN BE EFFECTIVELY USED TO DETERMINE WHICH MONITORING SITES ARE TO BE PRESERVED WHEN THE NETWORK IS CONSOLIDATED FOR A FIXED NUMBER OF STATIONS. HOWEVER, PREVIOUS STUDIES ON THE USE OF THE DPA METHODOLOGY IN NETWORK REDESIGN HAVE NOT YET RESOLVED TWO BASIC QUESTIONS: (1) WHAT IS THE REQUIRED (OPTIMUM) NUMBER OF STATIONS TO BE RETAINED IN THE NETWORK TO BEST REPRESENT THE BASIN? AND (2) HOW MANY SUBBASINS SHOULD BE SELECTED WHEN SEGREGATING THE BASIN INTO SMALLER UNITS AS FORESEEN BY DPA? ACCORDINGLY, THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO MODIFY THE DPA APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMUM NUMBER OF STATIONS TO BE RETAINED WHEN CONSOLIDATING A MONITORING NETWORK. IN PREVIOUS STUDIES, THE SELECTION OF SUBBASINS IN DPA WAS REALIZED BASICALLY BY SUBJECTIVE APPROACHES BASED ON GENERAL EXPERIENCES OF THE DESIGNERS SO THAT THE SECONDARY OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY IS TO EXPAND THE CAPABILITIES OF DPA BY UTILIZING A MORE SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO SUBBASIN IDENTIFICATION. THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED MODIFICATIONS TO THE DPA METHODOLOGY ARE DEMONSTRATED IN THE CASE OF A WATER QUALITY MONITORING NETWORK IN GEDIZ RIVER BASIN ALONG THE AEGEAN COAST OF TURKEY. THE RESULTS OBTAINED INDICATE THAT DPA CAN ALSO BE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL IN OPTIMIZING THE NUMBER OF STATIONS TO BE RETAINED IN A MONITORING NETWORK.  2012 AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS.,MONITORING; OPTIMIZATION; SAMPLING SITES; WATER QUALITY,EFFECTIVE TOOL; ENVIRONMENTAL DEMANDS; FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS; FIXED NUMBERS; GEDIZ RIVER; ITERATIVE PROCEDURES; MONITORING NETWORK; MONITORING SITES; NETWORK REDUCTION; OPTIMUM NUMBER; PRIMARY OBJECTIVE; SAMPLING SITES; SPACE DOMAIN; SUBBASINS; WATER QUALITY MONITORING; WATER QUALITY SAMPLING; DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING; MONITORING; OPTIMIZATION; WATER CONSERVATION; WATER MANAGEMENT; WATER SUPPLY; WATER QUALITY; BASIN ANALYSIS; DEMAND ANALYSIS; ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING; OPTIMIZATION; RIVER WATER; WATER MANAGEMENT; WATER QUALITY; GEDIZ BASIN; TURKEY,,,,,,BELTON, V., STEWART, J.S., (2002) MULTIPLE CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS: AN INTEGRATED APPROACH, , KLUWER, UK; CETINKAYA, C.P., SPATIAL OPTIMIZATION OF HYDROLOGIC MONITORING NETWORKS ON RIVERS (2007), PH.D.

AMONG REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES, SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR IS A PARTICULARLY ADVANTAGEOUS METHOD TO MONITOR MANGROVES: IMAGES ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON CLOUD COVER AND CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION FROM FOREST UNDERSTORY. THIS ARTICLE MAPPED MANGROVE FORESTS IN THE SOUTHERN COAST OF SAO PAULO STATE (BRAZIL) USING FREQUENCY BASED CONTEXTUAL CLASSIFICATION OF INCOHERENT ATTRIBUTES DERIVED FROM A MULTI POLARIZED PHASED ARRAY L BAND SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (PALSAR) IMAGE. THE USE OF 10 INCOHERENT ATTRIBUTES AND ONLY 3 SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (SAR) VEGETATION INDICES AS INPUT FOR DIGITAL CLASSIFICATION SHOWED THE BEST ACCURACIES WITH KAPPA INDEX VALUES OF 0.739 AND 0.734, RESPECTIVELY. HH POLARIZATION AND SAR VEGETATION INDICES WERE THE ATTRIBUTES THAT CONTRIBUTED MOST TO THE MANGROVE MAPPING PROCEDURE. THE USE OF L BAND SAR DATA WAS EFFECTIVE FOR MAPPING MANGROVE AREAS, AND THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED AS A TOOL FOR COASTAL MANAGEMENT.  2012 TAYLOR & FRANCIS.,,ALOS/PALSAR; ANIMAL SPECIES; CLOUD COVER; COASTAL COMMUNITIES; COASTAL MANAGEMENT; CONTEXTUAL CLASSIFICATION; DIGITAL CLASSIFICATION; FOREST UNDERSTORY; KAPPA INDEX; L BAND SAR; L BAND SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADARS; MANGROVE FOREST; REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES; TROPICAL REGIONS; VEGETATION INDEX; COASTAL ENGINEERING; COASTAL ZONES; FORESTRY; MAPPING; REMOTE SENSING; SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR; ALOS; CLOUD COVER; COASTAL ZONE; COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT; DATA SET; FOREST ECOSYSTEM; HABITAT TYPE; MANGROVE; MAPPING METHOD; REMOTE SENSING; SUBTROPICAL REGION; SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR; UNDERSTORY; FORESTRY; MAPPING; RADAR; REMOTE SENSING; BRAZIL; SAO PAULO [BRAZIL]; ANIMALIA; RHIZOPHORACEAE,,,,,,CUNHA LIGNON, M., COELHO JR., C., ALMEIDA, R., MENGHINI, R., CORREA, F., SCHAEFFERNOVELLI, Y., CINTRON MOLERO, G., DAHDOUH GUEBAS, F., MANGROVE FORESTS AND SEDIMENTARY PROCESSES ON THE SOUTH COAST OF SAO PAULO STATE (BRAZIL) (2009) JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH, SI, 56, PP. 405 409; CUNHA LIGNON, M., KAMPEL, M., MENGHINI, R.P., SCHAEFFER NOVELLI, Y., CINTRON, G., DAHDOUH GUEBAS, F., MANGROVE FORESTS SUBMITTED TO DEPOSITIONAL PROCESSES AND SALINITY VARIATION INVESTIGATED USING SATELLITE IMAGES AND VEGETATION STRUCTURE SURVEYS (2011) JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH, SI, 64, PP. 344 348; FROMARD, F., VEGA, C., PROISY, C., HALF A CENTURY OF DYNAMIC COASTAL CHANGE AFFECTING MANGROVE SHORELINES OF FRENCH GUIANA.

TO COMPREHENSIVELY RECORD TSUNAMI TRACE HEIGHTS AND IMPACTS ALONG THE COASTAL REGION, THE TOHOKU EARTHQUAKE TSUNAMI JOINT SURVEY GROUP WAS ORGANIZED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EVENT. AS PART OF THIS GROUP, THE AUTHORS CONDUCTED A FIELD SURVEY IN MIYAGI AND FUKUSHIMA PREFECTURES. THE SURVEYED AREA CAN BE DIVIDED INTO 2 PARTS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ITS GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES: THE NORTHERN PART (A RIAS COASTAL AREA) AND THE SOUTHERN PART (A COASTAL PLAIN AREA). IN THIS PAPER, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DAMAGE DUE TO THE TSUNAMI IN EACH AREA ARE ANALYZED BY USING BOTH THE RESULTS OF THE AUTHORS OWN FIELD SURVEY AND THE JOINT SURVEY GROUP. IN THE RIAS COASTAL AREA, INUNDATION HEIGHTS WERE MORE THAN 10 M, WHICH RESULTED IN THE FLOODING OF THE LOW LYING GROUNDS LOCATED AT THE INNER PART OF THE BAYS. THE TSUNAMI WAVE CAUSED WIDESPREAD DESTRUCTION IN THIS AREA, AND COASTAL BUILDINGS (INCLUDING REINFORCED CONCRETE BUILDINGS) SUFFERED SEVERE DAMAGE. IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAINS, INUNDATION HEIGHTS WERE 510 M AND THE TSUNAMI REACHED A FEW KILOMETERS INLAND, THOUGH UNFORTUNATELY THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH HIGH LOCATIONS OR BUILDINGS FOR THE RESIDENTS TO EVACUATE. IN ADDITION, AN EXTENSIVE LINE OF COASTAL DIKES AND FORESTS, WHICH HAD BEEN PLACED TO PROTECT THE WIDE PLAINS BEHIND THEM, ALSO SUFFERED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE. FROM THESE GEOGRAPHICALLY DEPENDENT INUNDATION AND DESTRUCTION PATTERNS, A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT LESSONS ON HOW TO MODIFY AND IMPROVE FUTURE RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES CAN BE OBTAINED.  2012 WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING COMPANY AND JAPAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS.,2011 OFF THE PACIFIC COAST OF TOHOKU EARTHQUAKE; COASTAL STRUCTURE; FIELD SURVEY; TSUNAMI; TSUNAMI TRACE HEIGHT,COASTAL AREA; COASTAL DIKES; COASTAL PLAIN; COASTAL REGIONS; COASTAL STRUCTURES; EAST COAST; FIELD SURVEYS; GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES; LOCAL TIME; RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES; TSUNAMI WAVES; COASTAL ZONES; EARTHQUAKES; FLOODS; RISK MANAGEMENT; SURVEYS; TSUNAMIS,,,,,,(2005) GUIDELINES FOR TSUNAMI EVACUATION BUILDINGS, , HTTP://WWW.BOUSAI.GO.JP/OSHIRASE/H17/TSUNAMI.HINAN.HTML, CABINET OFFICE GOVERNMENT OF JAPANM, (IN JAPANESE; DANIELSEN, F., SORENSEN, M.K., OLWIG, M.F., SELVAM, V., PARISH, F., BURGESS, N.D., HIRAISHI, T., SURYADIPUTRA, N., THE ASIAN TSUNAMI: A PROTECTIVE ROLE FOR COASTAL VEGETATION (2005) SCIENCE, 310 (5748), P. 643. , DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.1118387; (2011) DISASTER INFORMATION FOR 2011 OF THE PACIFFIC COAST OF TOHOKU EARTHQUAKE, (140). , HTTP://WWW.FDMA.GO.JP/BN/HIGAIHOU.HTML, FIRE AND DISASTER MANAGEMENT AGENCY, (IN JAPANESE; (2009) ENCLOSED COASTAL SEAS IN JAPAN, , HTTP://WWW.EMECS.OR.JP/CLOSEDSEA JP/CLOSEDSEA JP.HTM, INTERNATIONAL EMECS CENTER,(IN JAPANESE; KAKINUMA, T., TSUJIMOTO, G., YASUDA, T., TAMADA, T., TRACE SURVEY OF THE 2011 TOHOKU TSUNAMI IN THE NORTH OF MIYAGI PREFECTURE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF BIDIRECTIONAL TSUNAMIS IN UTATSUSAKI PENINSULA (2012) COAST.

YEARS. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO DRAW LESSONS FOR MANAGEMENT OF COMPLEX HAZARDOUS ACTIVITIES FROM THESE EVENTS BY ANALYSING CRITICAL DECISIONS REGARDING WELL CONTROL BARRIERS. CONCEPTS SUCH AS TRIAL AND ERROR LEARNING, SENSEMAKING AND THE NEED FOR MULTIPLE BARRIERS ARE USED TO DEMONSTRATE WHY THE ORGANISATION WAS BLIND TO THE DEVELOPING PROBLEMS AND HENCE WHY LACK OF TECHNICAL COMPETENCE ALONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN THE EVENTS THAT OCCURRED. THREE ORGANISATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS ARE PROPOSED PROVIDING ACTIVE SUPERVISION, IMPROVED TECHNICAL INTEGRITY ASSURANCE AND BETTER USE OF RISK ASSESSMENT.

IN THIS PAPER WE PRESENT A STANDALONE REMOTE VIDEO BASED METHOD THAT ESTIMATES WAVE HEIGHT AT THE BREAKPOINT. INDIVIDUAL BREAKING EVENTS ARE FIRST IDENTIFIED FROM CHANGES IN OPTICAL PROPERTIES AND WAVE HEIGHT IS FURTHER DERIVED FROM THE OPTICAL SIGNATURE AT THE ONSET OF BREAKING. AN EXTENDED VALIDATION IS PERFORMED USING A DENSE WAVE BASIN DATASET. THE RESULTS SHOW THE ABILITY OF THE METHOD TO MEASURE INDIVIDUAL BREAKER HEIGHTS (9% OF MEAN ERROR, 18% RMS). IN ADDITION, THE UNIQUE COMBINATION OF IN SITU AND REMOTELY SENSED DATA ALLOWS THE ESTIMATION OF TWO OTHER BREAKING RELATED PARAMETERS, THE HEIGHT TO DEPTH RATIO AND WAVE FRONT FACE SLOPE, WHICH SHOW A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF DISPERSION. BECAUSE NEARSHORE VIDEO SYSTEMS ARE RAPIDLY SPREADING OVER WORLD COASTS, THIS LOW COST REMOTE BREAKER HEIGHT ESTIMATOR SHOULD ENCOUNTER LARGE INTEREST IN COASTAL ENGINEERING STUDIES.  2011 ELSEVIER B.V.,COASTAL MANAGEMENT; HEIGHT TO DEPTH RATIO; LABORATORY EXPERIMENT; REMOTE SENSING; ROLLER; WAVE FRONT FACE ANGLE; WAVE MEASUREMENT,COASTAL MANAGEMENT; HEIGHT TO DEPTH RATIO; LABORATORY EXPERIMENT; ROLLER; WAVE FRONT FACE ANGLE; WAVE MEASUREMENT; COASTAL ENGINEERING; ESTIMATION; OPTICAL PROPERTIES; REMOTE SENSING; WATER WAVES; WAVEFRONTS; PARAMETER ESTIMATION; BREAKING WAVE; COASTAL ENGINEERING; COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT; DATA SET; ESTIMATION METHOD; EXPERIMENTAL STUDY; IMAGERY; LABORATORY METHOD; NEARSHORE DYNAMICS; REMOTE SENSING; WAVE HEIGHT,,,,,,AARNINKHOF, S.G.J., RUESSINK, B.G., ROELVINK, J.A., NEARSHORE SUBTIDAL BATHYMETRY FROM TIME EXPOSURE VIDEO IMAGES (2005) JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, 110, PP.

A COMBINATION OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO LOSS OF LIFE, INCLUDING THE LACK OF DEFINED EVACUATION ROUTES. THIS VULNERABILITY TO TSUNAMI ATTACKS HAS RECENTLY BEEN ADDRESSED WITH THE DEMARCATION OF EVACUATION ROUTES, ALONG BOTH WELL MAINTAINED ARTERIES AND NATIVE SURFACE (UNPAVED) ROADS. HOWEVER, POOR LOCATION DESIGN AND IRREGULAR MAINTENANCE WILL REDUCE THE LIFETIME THAT THE LATTER CAN PROVIDE SAFE EGRESS FROM REMOTE COASTLINES. IN THIS WORK WE IDENTIFIED 10 MAJOR GULLIES AND 18 LANDSLIDES ALONG A CRITICAL 0.5 KM SECTION OF A TSUNAMI EVACUATION ROAD ACCESSING A REMOTE BEACH OF THE ANDAMAN COAST IN SOUTHERN THAILAND. EROSION RATES FROM LANDSLIDES AND GULLIES APPROACHED 9500 MG HA 1 IN LESS THAN A YEAR FOLLOWING WIDENING OF THE ROAD. IMPORTANTLY, THE DEGRADATION FEATURES, LANDSLIDES IN PARTICULAR, REDUCED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ROAD TO SERVE AS A SAFE PASSAGEWAY TO ESCAPE FUTURE TSUNAMIS OR LARGE STORM SURGES. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT GREATER ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO APPROPRIATE ROAD LOCATION, DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE IN INTEGRATED PROGRAMMES AIMED AT REDUCING TSUNAMI VULNERABILITY IN REMOTE COASTAL AREAS, NOT ONLY ON THE ANDAMAN COAST, BUT WORLDWIDE.

THE AIM OF THE SURVEY WAS TO MEASURE SAFETY CLIMATE AND RISK PERCEPTION AMONG THE CREW MEMBERS. IN ADDITION, OBSERVATION OF WORK PRACTICE WAS CARRIED OUT ON 10 CARGO VESSELS. THE SURVEY DATA SHOWS SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN (1) SCANDINAVIAN SPEAKING, (2) RUSSIAN SPEAKING AND (3) FILIPINOS, THUS SUGGESTING THAT SAFETY CLIMATE ARE DETERMINED BY DIFFERENT CULTURAL INTERPRETATIONS. HOWEVER; OBSERVATIONS AND INTERVIEWS SHOWS THAT WORKING CONDITIONS AND THE FORMAL WORK CONTEXTS VARY FOR THE PEOPLE OF THESE DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES EVEN THOUGH THEY ALL SAIL ON CARGO VESSELS, OWNED BY NORWEGIAN SHIP OWNERS, OPERATING ONLY ON THE NORWEGIAN COAST. WE SUGGEST THAT VARYING SAFETY CLIMATE MUST BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE DIFFERENCES OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THEY WORK WITHIN. SEAFARERS OF DIFFERENT VESSELS WORK UNDER VARYING REGIMES DEPENDENT ON THE FLAG STATE THEY SAIL UNDER; DECIDING CONTRACT FORMALITIES AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THAT VESSEL. BASED ON THE 2010 SURVEY, IN THIS PAPER WE THEREFORE DISCUSS THE RELATIONS OF VARYING FLAG STATE AND SHIP REGISTERS, REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND SAFETY CLIMATE.  2012 TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP.,,CARGO VESSELS; CREW MEMBERS; FLAG STATE; REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS; SAFETY CLIMATE; SHIP OWNERS; SURVEY DATA; WORK PRACTICES; WORKING CONDITIONS; RELIABILITY; RISK MANAGEMENT; RISK PERCEPTION; SHIPS; SURVEYS,,,,,,ANTONSEN, S., SAFETY CULTURE ASSESSMENT: A MISSION IMPOSSIBLE?

THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO UNDERSTAND AND EXPLAIN SHADOW EVACUATION BY COMPARING PERCEIVED RISKS WITH ENGINEERING RISK ESTIMATES AT THE HOUSEHOLD LEVEL PARTICULARLY IN NONEVACUATION ZONES WHERE UNDESIRABLE EVACUATION DECISIONS ARE MADE RATHER THAN BY COMPARING PERCEIVED RISKS WITH REGIONAL HAZARDS THAT PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE MEASURED. A PROPOSED METHODOLOGY TO COMPUTE ENGINEERING RISK ESTIMATES FROM HURRICANE HAZARDS IS ILLUSTRATED FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION PROPERTIES IN HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS. THESE RISKS ARE THEN COMPARED WITH RISK PERCEPTIONS FROM A SURVEY OF RESIDENTS WHICH WAS CONDUCTED AFTER HURRICANE IKES LANDFALL IN 2008. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT EVACUATION BEHAVIOR IS RELATED TO A HURRICANE INDUCED SURGE AND WIND RISK MISMATCH AND THAT RISK OVERESTIMATION AND UNDERESTIMATION ARE MORE LIKELY SEEN IN LOCATIONS NEAR THE WATERWAYS. THE RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT SHADOW EVACUATION IS PARTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO RISK OVERESTIMATION. THE OVERESTIMATION OF DAMAGE RISK FROM WIND OR SURGE CORRELATES TO 108,031 SHADOW EVACUEES.

MOST TRANSPORTATION DATASETS ARE OFFERED AS RAW DISJOINT DATA CONTAINING DISSIMILAR ATTRIBUTES FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES MAKING THEM DIFFICULT TO FATHOM ANY SPATIAL LINKAGES. ROUTE OPTIMIZATION AND MARKET ACCESSIBILITY ARE INCREASINGLY BECOMING IMPORTANT AND SIGNIFICANT AS NEWER CONTAINER DECONGESTION METHODS ARE PUT IN PLACE. ORIGIN DESTINATION DICHOTOMIES CAN BEST BE HARNESSED IN THE UNITED STATES BY OPTIMIZING ROUTES BASED ON AVAILABLE DATABASES. IN THIS STUDY, THE PUBLIC USE WAYBILL SAMPLE DATABASE FROM SURFACE TRANSPORATION BOARD WERE USED AS PRELIMINARY INPUTS FOR INLAND RAILWAY ROUTE OPTIMIZATION. THE PAPER UTILIZED AN APPROACH AKIN TO ONE USED IN RIVERINE MANAGEMENT TO OPTIMIZE CONTAINER ROUTES. FROM THE PRIMER DATABASES, IN AS MUCH AS MOST IMPORT CONTAINERS ORIGINATE FROM ASIA AND EUROPE AND SHIPPED TO THE U. S. THROUGH SPECIFIC NORTH AMERICAN PORTS, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION GETS TO INLAND MARKETS THROUGH PACIFIC COAST IN THE U. S. THE MAIN HUB PORTS FOR IMPORT CONTAINERS ARE LOS ANGELES/LONG BEACH AND SEATTLE FOR TRANSPACIFIC TRADE AND NEW YORK/NEW JERSEY AND SAVANNAH FOR TRANSATLANTIC TRADE. AN ANOMALOUS AND NOTABLY HIGH VOLUME FLOW CAN BE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE PACIFIC COAST AND THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AREA INCLUDING METROPOLITAN AREAS LIKE MINNEAPOLIS, CHICAGO, KANSAS CITY, MEMPHIS, DALLAS, AND HOUSTON. ASSESSING MOVEMENT IN THE MIDWEST TO EAST U. S. , MOST CONTAINER TRAFFIC VOLUME PASSES THROUGH NEW YORK/NEW JERSEY AND NORFOLK TO END IN CHICAGO.

THE NET IS SIMILAR TO ECOSYSTEM IN WHICH MEMBERS HIGHLY DEPENDENT WITH EACH OTHER. THIS NEW RELATIONSHIP ENHANCES ENTERPRISE OPERATION EFFICIENCY, BUT BRINGS ABOUT MORE RISK FACTORS IN THE SAME TIME. IN RECENT YEARS, ALL KINDS OF SUPPLY CHAIN INTERRUPTIONS HAVE MADE MANY COMPANIES SUFFER GREAT LOSS. MORE AND MORE CASES SHOW THAT, WITH THE INCREASING COMPLEXITY, SUPPLY CHAIN VULNERABILITY IS ALSO INCREASING. AS WE KNOW, THE TERRORIST ATTACK 9.11 HAPPENING IN 2001 FORCED NORTH AMERICAN AIRPORT TO CLOSE, CAUSING THOUSANDS OF SUPPLY CHAINS INTERRUPTED AND INESTIMABLE LOSS. IN SEPTEMBER 2002, WORKERS STROKED IN THE WEST COAST OF UNITED STATES, WHICH IS THE MAIN GATEWAY FOR CHINA OCEAN SHIPPING (GROUP) COMPANY (COSCO) TO ENTER THE NATION, LEADING COSCO LOST AT LEAST 24 MILLION DOLLARS IN TWO WEEKS. IN RECENT YEARS, CHINAS POISON MILK POWDER EVENT CAUSED INTERNATIONAL CONCERN, ALL KINDS OF FOOD SAFETY PROBLEMS AROUSED, REFLECTING THE ABSENCE OF SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT.

HOWEVER, GROUNDWATER ABSTRACTION CAN EXCEED RECHARGE DURING TIMES OF DROUGHT, RESULTING IN SALINE INTRUSION. FOLLOWING HYDROGEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS IN THE 1970S AND 1980S, A REGIONAL GROUNDWATER MODEL WAS DEVELOPED TO UNDERPIN THE TACTICAL MANAGEMENT OF THE AQUIFER. ALTHOUGH IT IS A COARSE, SINGLE LAYER, CONSTANT DENSITY MODEL, ROUTINE REGULATORY USE OF THE MODEL SINCE 1988 HAS ENABLED A SUSTAINABLE LEVEL OF GROUNDWATER ABSTRACTION TO BE REACHED AND BROUGHT SALINE INTRUSION UNDER CONTROL. ABSTRACTION RATES HAVE BEEN PROACTIVELY ADJUSTED TO SUIT PREVAILING CONDITIONS USING MODEL FORECASTS. FORECASTS ARE EVALUATED AGAINST MODEL BASED THRESHOLDS, SET BY COMPARING MODEL OUTPUT (E.G. AQUIFER ESTUARY FLUX) WITH OBSERVED DATA (E.G. GROUNDWATER SALINITY). THE SUCCESS OF THE MODEL IN MANAGING GROUNDWATER RESOURCES IS ATTRIBUTED TO: FIELD BASED HYDROGEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS INFORMING THE MODEL DESIGN; COLLABORATION BETWEEN REGULATORS AND ABSTRACTORS, WHICH HAS BUILT CONFIDENCE IN THE MODEL RESULTS; COMMITMENT TO UPDATING THE MODEL; AND FLEXIBILITY IN THE SUPPLY NETWORK THROUGH CONJUNCTIVE USE OF GROUND AND SURFACE WATER. THE MODEL HAS ALSO BEEN APPLIED FOR PURPOSES NOT CONSIDERED DURING DEVELOPMENT AND HAS THEREFORE PROVIDED VALUE FOR MONEY FOR THE UK WATER INDUSTRY OVER A 30 YEAR PERIOD.,,AQUIFER; GROUNDWATER; GROUNDWATER RESOURCE; HYDROGEOLOGY; NUMERICAL MODEL; RECHARGE; SALINE INTRUSION; WATER INDUSTRY; WATER SUPPLY; ENGLAND; LINCOLNSHIRE; UNITED KINGDOM,,,,,,BERRIDGE, N.G., PATTISON, J., (1994) GEOLOGY OF THE COUNTRY AROUND GRIMSBY AND PATRINGTON, , LONDON, BRITISH GEOLOGICAL SURVEY/HMSO, MEMOIR FOR THE 1:50 000 GEOLOGICAL SHEETS 90 AND 91 AND 81 AND 82 (ENGLAND AND WALES); (2009) LINCOLNSHIRE CHALK AND SPILSBY SANDSTONE GROUNDWATER INVESTIGATION: REGIONAL CONCEPTUALISATION OVERVIEW REPORT, , ENTEC UK, CONTRACTOR REPORT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY OF ENGLAND AND WALES, ANGLIAN REGION; GRAY, D.A., (1964) GROUND WATER CONDITIONS OF THE CHALK OF THE GRIMSBY AREA, LINCOLNSHIRE, 1. , WATER SUPPLY PAPERS OF THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF GREAT BRITAIN.

THE WESTERN AQUIFER BASIN FORMS A MAJOR PART OF THE COMPLEX, LARGELY KARST, LIMESTONE SYSTEM OF THE WEST BANK MOUNTAIN AQUIFER. THE AQUIFER CROPS OUT AND IS RECHARGED SOLELY IN THE SEMI ARID UPLANDS OF THE WEST BANK AND GROUNDWATER FLOWS WEST BENEATH ISRAEL TO DISCHARGE AT THE YARQON AND NAHAL TANINIM SPRINGS NEAR THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST. ANNUAL RECHARGE TO THE AQUIFER IS NOT EASY TO QUANTIFY BUT LIES WITHIN THE RANGE 270X106 TO 455X106 M3 A 1, AND CURRENT UNCERTAINTIES DO NOT SUPPORT DEFINITION OF A SINGLE VALUE OF LONG TERM AVERAGE RECHARGE. THE RESOURCE IS HEAVILY EXPLOITED AND ABSTRACTION IS DIRECTLY CONTROLLED AND APPORTIONED BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE WEST BANK BY ISRAEL. THE KEY TO EQUITABLE APPORTIONMENT IS THE DETERMINATION OF THE LONG TERM AVERAGE RECHARGE TO THE BASIN, WHICH ALSO REQUIRES DEFINITION OF THE EASTERN BOUNDARY OF THE BASIN TO CONFIRM THE RECHARGE AREA. CALCULATIONS INCLUDE EMPIRICAL FORMULAE AND PROCESS BASED MODELS THAT ARE LIKELY TO CONSTRAIN THE BEST ESTIMATE PROVIDED THAT THERE IS APPROPRIATE, ONGOING MONITORING.
