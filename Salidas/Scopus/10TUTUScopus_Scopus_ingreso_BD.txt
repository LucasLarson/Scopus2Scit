REFORMER. HE WANTED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE POOR OF LONDON TO MOVE OUT OF THEIR SLUMS AND TRAVEL EASILY AND CHEAPLY INTO LONDON FROM NEW TOWNS PLANNED FOR LOCATIONS SUCH AS HORNSEY OR TOTTENHAM. THE 1854 5 COMMONS SELECT COMMITTEE ON METROPOLITAN COMMUNICATIONS TOOK A FAVORABLE VIEW OF PEARSONS ARGUMENTS AND RECOMMENDED THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN UNDERGROUND RAILWAY TO CONNECT THE VARIOUS TERMINI WITH A CENTRAL STATION AT FARRINGDON. COMPENSATION. FINANCIAL BACKING FOR THE METROPOLITAN RAILWAY COMPANY WAS SLOW TO MATERIALIZE. WHILE THE GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY WAS PREPARED TO INVEST GBP 175,000 THE GREAT NORTHERN WAS MORE RELUCTANT.	8	***

NOT ONLY ARE HARD ROCK MACHINES WELL SUITED TO THE SOUND IGNEOUS ROCK UNDERNEATH THE HOUSES OF THE WELL OFF WESTERN SUBURBS, BUT ALSO BECAUSE THERE WERE MACHINES AVAILABLE IN THE CITY. THE TBMS ALSO HAPPEN TO BE THE RIGHT SIZE AND CAPACITY. LIKE THE CLEM 7, WHICH OPENED IN 2009, THE LEGACY TUNNEL WILL BE A TWIN, TWO LANE MOTORWAY, RUNNING BENEATH AND INTO THE CENTRAL PART OF THE CITY, WHICH HAS BEEN GROWING MORE AND MORE CONGESTED. THE FIRST, CLEM 7, TUNNEL RUNS FROM THE SOUTHERN SUBURBS UNDERNEATH THE BRISBANE RIVER, AND THE NEW TUNNEL WILL BRING IN TRAFFIC FROM THE WEST. THE TRANSAPEX PROJECT, AS IT IS CALLED, HAS SO FAR SEEN THE BUILDING OF THE CLEM 7 AND THE Y SHAPED AIRPORT LINK INTO THE NORTHERN SUBURBS AND AS THE NAME SUGGESTS TO THE AIRPORT NEAR THE COAST.	0	***

THE NUMBER OF JOBS IN THE CITY IS PROJECTED TO RISE BY APPROACHING 20 PER CENT IN THE SAME PERIOD. THE LONDON UNDERGROUND IS THE BUSIEST IT HAS EVER BEEN. IN RECENT YEARS ANNUAL PASSENGER JOURNEY NUMBERS HAVE RISEN STEADILY REACHING OVER 1.2BN IN THE 2012/2013 YEAR. ON A TYPICAL WEEK DAY OVER 4M INDIVIDUAL JOURNEYS ARE MADE. ON TUESDAY AUGUST 7, 2012 DURING THE LONDON OLYMPIC GAMES A RECORD PEAK OF 4.57 MILLION PASSENGERS USED THE TUBE. LOOKING AHEAD CURRENT PROJECTIONS SUGGEST ANNUAL JOURNEYS WILL REACH 1.5BN BY 2020. LU HAS COMMITTED TO A PROGRAM OF LINE AND STATION UPGRADES. THE LINE UPGRADES DELIVER NEW SIGNALING SYSTEMS AND IN MANY CASES ALSO NEW TRAINS, TO INCREASE CAPACITY BY PUSHING MORE TRAINS THROUGH THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE.	0	***

ALL BUT THE METROPOLITAN WERE INCORPORATED IN THE UNDERGROUND ELECTRIC RAILWAY LIMITED, WHICH HAD BEEN FORMED BY THE AMERICAN TYCOON, CHARLES TYSON YERKES. THE MOST SERIOUS DANGER IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR IN LONDON WAS BOMBING EITHER BY ZEPPELINS OR PLANES. THERE WERE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS AS THEY INTERFERED WITH THE PASSENGERS. AS THE UNDERGROUND WAS PERCEIVED AS SAFER AND WITH THE ADDITIONAL NUMBERS DUE TO MANY TROOPS MOVING AROUND THE CAPITAL, THE USE OF THE SYSTEM INCREASED DRAMATICALLY DURING THE WAR. PEOPLE BECAME MORE ACCUSTOMED TO USING THE UNDERGROUND. EVENTUALLY, IT WAS DECIDED THAT TRAINS SHOULD PROCEED SLOWLY DURING RAIDS. THE IMPACT OF THE SECOND WORLD WARFROM 1939 TO 1945 ON THE LONDON UNDERGROUND WAS MUCH MORE PROFOUND AND DRAMATIC. THE WAR WAS NOT UNEXPECTED AND PLANS FOR THE EMERGENCY WERE MADE AS EARLY AS 1937.	9	***

WITH THE NATIONALIZATION OF LAND TRANSPORT IN 1948 IT BECAME A PART OF THE BEHEMOTH THAT WAS THE BRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION (BTC). IT WAS A PERIOD OF STATE CONTROL OF SERVICES, BUT THIS WAS AN INTERESTING STEP AS IT EFFECTIVELY RENATIONALISED A PUBLIC SECTOR ENTITY. THE TREASURY EFFECTIVELY CONTROLLED THE BTC. WITH A NATION CRYING OUT FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO HEALTH, A NEED FOR ELECTRICITY AND MAJOR NEW HOUSE BUILDING PROJECTS; LONDONS INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS WERE PERHAPS A SECONDARY CONCERN. BTC WAS ABOLISHED IN 1963 IN FAVOR OF DIRECT MINISTERIAL CONTROL OF THE NETWORK. HOWEVER, THIS DIDNT BENEFIT THE BUDGET. RECORDS SHOW GBP 1.1M AVAILABLE FOR IMPROVEMENTS ANNUALLY. IN 1970, LT BECAME PART OF THE IOCAI GOVERNMENT BODY, GREATER LONDON COUNCIL (GLC). HOWEVER, SINCE THE NEW WORKS PROGRAM OF THE 1930S, THE UNDERGROUND HAD LANGUISHED THROUGH THREE DECADES OF NEGLECT.	14	***

THE ORIGINAL TUNNELS BUILT WERE DONE SO FOR THE TASK OF OVERCOMING GEOLOGICAL PROBLEMS NAMELY RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS. NOW THEY ARE ALSO USED TO OVERCOME MANMADE OBSTACLES, CITIES. THE VEHICULAR TRAFFIC HAS INCREASED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT TO TRAVEL THROUGH A CITY BY CAR TAKES AS LONG IN THE 21ST CENTURY AS IT DID IN THE 19TH CENTURY. THE ENERGY REQUIREMENT INCREASES SO WHEN THE FAN IS SIZED FOR THE SYSTEM THE FAN MUST BE ABLE TO STILL COLLECT DUST WHEN THE BAG IS FULL AND REQUIRES CHANGING. ELECTROSTATIC PRECIPITATORS HAVE CHANGED OVER THE YEARS. THE ORIGINAL PRECIPITATORS HAD WIRES IN THE IONIZING SECTION TO GENERATE THE CORONA DISCHARGE WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THE PRECIPITATOR TO WORK. THE PROBLEM WITH USING WIRES WAS THAT THEY COULD BREAK DUE TO THE HIGH VOLTAGE VIBRATING THE WIRES AND ELECTRO DISCHARGE MACHINING.	0	***

THE BRANISKO TUNNEL IS A 5KM LONG ROAD TUNNEL WITH BIDIRECTIONAL TRAFFIC IN EASTERN SLOVAKIA, WHICH WAS OPENED IN 2003. AN ESCAPE TUNNEL IS SITUATED PARALLEL TO THE ROAD TUNNEL. THE TUNNEL IS EQUIPPED WITH A SEMI TRANSVERSAL VENTILATION SYSTEM WITH SMOKE EXTRACTION DAMPERS, WHICH WAS DESIGNED IN THE 1990S. THE FIRST TEST WAS A SUCCESS. ALTHOUGH THE SMOKE EXTRACTION CAPACITY WAS NOT SUFFICIENT, DUE TO HIGH DUCT LEAKAGES, THE FIRE VENTILATION SYSTEM WAS ABLE TO LIMIT THE SPREAD OF SMOKE AND FINALLY TO REMOVE THE FUMES FROM THE TUNNEL. HOWEVER, THE SAFETY ISSUE IS MORE COMPLICATED IN TUNNELS WITH BIDIRECTIONAL TRAFFIC OR IN UNIDIRECTIONAL CITY TUNNELS, WHERE CONGESTIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN AND PEOPLE MAY BE TRAPPED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FIRE LOCATION.	0	***

THE ELECTED SITE IN SWEDEN IS AT FORSMARK, NORTH EAST OF STOCKHOLM, AND IT HAD TO COMPETE FOR THE RIGHT TO BE THE CANDIDATE SITE. AFTER YEARS OF SITE INVESTIGATION, THE SWEDISH NUCLEAR FUEL AND WASTE MANAGEMENT CO FILED AN APPLICATION FOR THE LICENSE TO CONSTRUCT AND OPERATE THE HIGH LEVEL WASTE VAULT IN 2011. SITE INVESTIGATION DATA HAD REVEALED STRESSES IN THE GRANITIC ROCK MASS, WHICH IS PART OF THE FENNOSCANDIAN SHIELD, TO BE LESS THAN EXPECTED; THE STRESS PROFILE DID NOT RISE WITH DEPTH AS QUICKLY AS HAD BEEN ESTIMATED. LESS STRESS MEANT MORE OPPORTUNITY TO EXCAVATE, AND AT DEEPER DEPTHS, TO CREATE STORAGE VAULTS WITHOUT DETRIMENTAL STRESS RELEASE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE QUALITY OF THE ROCK MASS. THE RESULT WAS THAT A VAULT COULD BE LOCATED ABOUT 470M BELOW THE SURFACE AT FORSMARK, OR ALMOST THE SAME DEPTH OSKARSHAMN.	0	***

TUNNEL FIRES CAN GENERATE LARGE QUANTITIES OF VERY HOT SMOKE. THIS SMOKE IS THERMALLY BUOYANT AND TENDS TO ACCUMULATE IN A HOT LAYER IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE SOFFIT OF THE TUNNEL. IN THE UK, AS IN MANY OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, IT HAS BECOME STANDARD PRACTICE TO INCLUDE THE INSTALLATION OF PASSIVE FIRE PROTECTION AS A PART OF THE DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR A TUNNEL REFURBISHMENT. THE APPLICATION OF PASSIVE FIRE PROTECTION SERVES TO THERMALLY INSULATE THE STRUCTURE OF THE TUNNEL FROM THE EFFECTS OF A FIRE, THEREBY PROTECT IT FROM FIRE DAMAGE. THE APPLICATION OF THERMAL INSULATION DOES NOT, OF COURSE, REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF HEAT ENERGY EMITTED BY THE FIRE. IT SIMPLY PREVENTS THAT HEAT ENERGY FROM BEING ABSORBED. A GOOD STARTING POINT TO START TO LOOK AT POTENTIAL FIRE DAMAGE IS TO EXAMINE IN MORE DETAIL THE STRUCTURE OF TUNNEL CABLES.	0	***

THE FIRST TUNNEL FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEMS IN THE UK WERE COMMISSIONED IN THE NEW TYNE CROSSING IN 2011, AND THE INSTALLATION OF HIGH PRESSURE MIST SYSTEMS IS CURRENTLY ONGOING IN THE DARTFORD TUNNELS BETWEEN KENT AND ESSEX. OTHER TUNNELS IN THE UK ARE ACTIVELY CONSIDERING SUCH FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, TUNNEL OPERATORS ARE CERTAINLY JUSTIFIED IN ASKING WHAT THE BENEFITS OF FIRE SUPPRESSION ARE, AND WHETHER THEIR PRICE TAG CAN REALLY BE JUSTIFIED. SUPPRESSION SYSTEMS HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF REDUCING THE INTENSITY OF ANY FIRES, SO AS TO REDUCE THE EXTENT OF ANY DAMAGE TO THE TUNNEL STRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT, AND ALSO SERVE TO PROTECT TUNNEL USERS FROM THE EFFECTS OF FIRE.	0	***

THE MACHINES ARE EPB TYPE, PRODUCTION NUMBERS S 609 (TONDA) AND S 610 (ADELA). THE NAMES WERE GIVEN TO THE MACHINES BY CHILDREN FROM MOTOL HOSPITAL. DURING THE NEGOTIATION WITH HERRENKNECHT, AND FOR FACTORY AND SITE ACCEPTANCES, METROSTAV EMPLOYED JOHN FOSTER, THE PROMINENT TBM EXPERT FROM THE UK. EPBM BORING WAS SUCCESSFUL, AND THE REQUIRED SKILLS FOR ASSEMBLY AND OPERATION WERE MASTERED RATHER QUICKLY. DURING THE ASSEMBLY, AND LATER DURING OPERATION, A NUMBER OF SPECIALISTS FROM HERRENKNECHT AND ITS SUB COMPANIES H+E AND VMT WERE PRESENT ON THE SITE. MANY OTHER COMPANIES SUPPLIED MATERIAL AND TECHNICAL HELP, INCLUDING BASF, MAPEL AND CONDAT. SEGMENT PRODUCTION WAS BY DOPRASTAV BRATISLAVA AT THEIR SEGMENT FACTORY IN SENEC, WITH NINE SETS OF STATIONARY MOULDS SUPPLIED BY HERRENKNECHT FORMWORK.	0	***

FROM MOSCOW NEW DELHI TO SINGAPORE, GOVERNMENTS ARE INITIATING LARGE AND EXTENSIVE NEW METRO PROJECTS TO DEAL WITH RISING POPULATIONS AND INCREASING COMMUTE TIMES. THE 21 KM SECTION THE DOWNTOWN LINE THREE IN SINGAPORE IS UNDERWAY, USING 29 TBMS EXCAVATING BETWEEN 16 STATION SITES IN SHORT BORES OFTEN LESS THAN 1 KM EACH. THE EFFECT OF THESE LARGE PROJECTS IS EQUALLY MASSIVE: WHOLE NEW SUBWAY SYSTEMS BUILT IN A SINGLE PUSH HAVE A LARGE IMPACT ON THE LOCAL POPULATION, ARE LOGISTICALLY COMPLEX, REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING, AND CAN PRESENT MANY CHALLENGES TO THE TUNNELING COMMUNITY. IN RUSSIAS CAPITAL CITY OF MORE THAN 12 MILLION PEOPLE, THE AVERAGE MUSCOVITE HAS BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO DAILY COMMUTES OF TWO HOURS OR MORE. THE METRO SYSTEM, NEARLY ENTIRELY UNDERGROUND, INVOLVES THE USE OF DOZENS OF MIXED GROUND EPBMS: THE LARGEST SIMULTANEOUS CONSTRUCTION BY TBM THAT HAS EVER TAKEN PLACE IN THE CITY.	0	***

THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT HAS MAINTAINED A PRUDENT FISCAL POLICY STANCE IN RECENT YEARS, WHICH, ALONG WITH A WELL CRAFTED MONETARY POLICY, HAS PUT THE ECONOMY INTO STRONG AND STABLE GROWTH. THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUCCEEDED IN CONSISTENTLY MAINTAINING THE DEFICIT BELOW THREE PER CENT OF GDP OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS. IT HAS ALSO MANAGED TO REDUCE ITS DEBT BURDEN FROM A PEAK OF 77 PER CENT OF GDP IN 2001 TO JUST 24 PER CENT IN 2012.

THE CONTINUOUS INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR BETTER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE TRAVEL FACILITIES IN MAJOR CITIES HAS LED TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE INTEREST IN ROUTING ROADS, RAILWAYS AND METROS THROUGH TUNNELS. DUE TO THE ABUNDANCE OF EXISTING UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE AT DEEPER DEPTHS, TUNNELS IN URBAN AREAS ARE OFTEN BEING CONSTRUCTED AT SHALLOW DEPTHS. BOTTOM UP CONSTRUCTION INVOLVES THE EXCAVATION OF A TRENCH IN WHICH THE TUNNEL IS ERECTED. TEMPORARY STRUCTURES, SUCH AS SHEET PILE WALLS, SECANT PILE WALLS, TANGENT PILE WALLS OR SHEET PILE WALLS ARE USUALLY REQUIRED AND INSTALLED BEFORE THE EXCAVATION TAKES PLACE TO SUPPORT IT. PROVIDING UNREINFORCED SIDE SLOPES MAY REQUIRE THE REMOVAL OF UP TO SIX TIMES MORE MATERIAL, AND SPREAD AN ADDITIONAL THREE TUNNEL DIAMETERS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE EXCAVATION FOR TUNNELS WITH DEPTH OF COVER EQUAL TO ITS DIAMETER.	0	***

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF ALL TUNNELING WORKS AT TCRSU WAS TO MINIMIZE GROUND MOVEMENTS. TO THIS EXTENT REDUCING EXCAVATED AREA, SPEED TO TUNNEL RING CLOSURE AND CONTROLLED TUNNEL ADVANCES WERE CRITICAL. THE PRIMARY GROUND SUPPORT FOR THE MAIN TUNNELS IS STEEL FIBER REINFORCED SPRAYED CONCRETE WITH A SPRAY APPLIED WATERPROOF MEMBRANE LOCATED AT THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY LININGS. THE INSTALLATION OF THE STEEL FRAMES WAS MADE SIGNIFICANTLY EASIER BECAUSE THEY WERE CARRIED OUT WITHIN THE TEMPORARY SCL SHELL. REMOVAL OF THE CROWN SEGMENTS OF THE PLATFORM TUNNELS REQUIRED A FULL LINE CLOSURE AND EACH WAS CARRIED OUT DURING A 52 HOUR WEEKEND POSSESSION. TO ENSURE SPEED OF INSTALLATION, STEEL I BEAMS WERE HALF CAST IN CONCRETE SO THEY COULD BE LOWERED INTO PLACE AND ACT AS PERMANENT FORMWORK FOR THE OVERBRIDGE FLOOR SLAB.	2	***

A DRAMATICALLY INCREASING AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC IN THE CITY OF STOCKHOLM IN THE MID 2OTH CENTURY LED TO A PLAN FOR A RING ROAD AROUND STOCKHOLM?S INNER CITY, TO RELIEVE THE CENTER FROM MOST TRAFFIC. A NEW CONCEPT FOR THE TUNNEL INNER LINING STRUCTURE HAS BEEN UTILIZED ON THIS PROJECT WHICH COMPRISES THE USE OF PRECAST ELEMENTS, A SUSPENDED SHELL STRUCTURE AND ALSO A SPRAYED CONCRETE LINING. THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF THE INNER LINING IS TO PROTECT THE TRAFFIC AGAINST ICE, DRIPPING WATER, FIRE AND THE FORCE.

ROUND LINING INTERACTION CONTROL IS ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL PROCESSES DURING A TUNNELING PROJECTS IMPLEMENTATION. SOME OF THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION DECISIONS DURING A TUNNEL PROJECT ARE VERY CRITICAL TO REDUCE THE GROUND MOVEMENTS AROUND THE EXCAVATED TUNNEL. TUNNEL LININGS ARE STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS, BUT DIFFER FROM OTHER STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS IN THEIR INTERACTION WITH THE SURROUNDING GROUND, WHICH IS AN INTEGRAL ASPECT OF THEIR BEHAVIOR, STABILITY AND OVERALL LOAD CARRYING CAPACITY. THE LOSS OR LACK OF SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE SURROUNDING GROUND CAN LEAD TO A FAILURE OF THE LINING. THE TUNNEL LINING DEFORMATION ALLOWS THE MOMENTS IN THE TUNNEL LINING TO REDISTRIBUTE THE MAIN LOAD INSIDE THE LINING WHICH ARE AXIAL OR ECCENTRIC LOAD. THE MOST EFFICIENT TUNNEL LINING IS ONE THAT HAS HIGH FLEXIBILITY AND DUCTILITY.	9	***

DUE TO HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS, CREATING A LARGE MODEL COVERING ALL NEW TUNNELS IN A SINGLE 3D FE MODEL WAS NOT FEASIBLE. THE WATER TABLE STANDS 6 M BELOW GROUND SURFACE. THE MAJORITY OF THE SCL TUNNELS ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE LONDON CLAY STRATUM WITH A VERY LOW PERMEABILITY. THEREFORE UNDRAINED SOIL PARAMETERS ARE CONSIDERED FOR THE ANALYSIS OF TUNNEL EXCAVATION STAGES AND THE PRIMARY LINING INSTALLATION. THE PRIMARY LINING IS DESIGNED ONLY TO CARRY TEMPORARY LOADS AND THE FINAL LINING TO SUSTAIN THE PROBABLE LONG TERM LOADS, ASSUMING THAT THE PRIMARY LINING DETERIORATES IN TIME. PRIOR TO ACTIVATING THE SECONDARY LINING IN THE MODEL, THE PRIMARY LINING BECOMES SACRIFICIAL BY SETTING ITS STIFFNESS TO ONE PER CENT OF THE ORIGINAL VALUE, HENCE THE LOADS UNDERTAKEN BY PRIMARY LINING BECOME NEGLIGIBLE AND THE LOADS ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE SECONDARY LINING.	8	***

AS A SUMMARY, THE FOLLOWING POINTS ARE RECOMMENDED: Â–  EVEN THE MOST SOPHISITCATED NUMERICAL MODEL IS INCAPABLE OF GIVING AN EXACT ANSWER. NUMERICAL MODELS DO HAVE LIMITATIONS, AND PERIL TO THE PROJECT LURKS WHEN THE RESULTS OF A MODEL ARE TRUSTED BLINDLY. HOWEVER, WHEN THE LIMITS OF THE MODEL ARE UNDERSTOOD, NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS CAN YIELD VEIY USEFUL INFORMATION. AS WITH MOST TASKS, WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE KNOW, BUT WE MUST ALSO KNOW WHAT WE DONT. Â–  MODELS ARE BUT MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS BASED ON FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING THEORIES. ENGINEERS SHOULD ALWAYS QUESTION AND CHALLENGE THEIR MODELS UP TO THE POINT THEY ARE ABLE TO EXPLAIN AND DEFEND THE RESULTS BASED ON THEORY AND/OR EXPERIENCE. CONFIDENCE IN THE ANALYSIS RESULTS SHOULD ARISE FROM AGREEMENT WITH RELEVANT PAST EXPERIENCE, CROSS CHECKING WITH ANALYTICAL OR SIMPLIFIED NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS, AND ABOVE ALL COMMON ENGINEERING SENSE. Â–  MODELLING ENGINEERS SHOULD KNOW THE HABITS OF THE SOFTWARE THEY ARE USING, ITS PROS AND CONS, AND TO DEVELOP A THOROUGH CHECKLIST THAT SIMPLIFIES THE MODELLING AND MOREOVER THE DEBUGGING PROCESS. NOTE ALSO, IN A POORLY CONSTRUCTED MODEL, DEBUGGING MAY TAKE UP TO 90 PER CENT OF THE OVERALL EFFORT. Â–  DECISIONS ON THE ANALYSIS APPROACH NEED TO BE ALIGNED WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROJECT TEAM. IT IS SOMETIMES PREFERABLE, DEPENDING ON THE CAPACITIES OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED, TO USE SIMPLER MODELS (E.G. SIMPLE CONSTITUTIVE LAWS) THAT ARE BETTER UNDERSTOOD AND COMMUNICATED. NUMERICAL MODELS ARE BUILT IN ORDER TO SUPPORT A PRE SPECIFIED ENGINEERS DECISION AND THEY SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD IN THIS CONTEXT. THIS, WHEN BALANCED WITH THE PROJECT BUDGET CAN LEAD TO AN EFFICIENT ANALYSIS CAMPAIGN. COPYRIGHT  2013 CATERPILLAR.	14	***

THE BEDROCK CONSISTS MAINLY OF PALAEOZOIC AGE ROCKS (MOSTLY ORDOVIC), AND ALSO TO A LESSER EXTENT THE ROCKS OF MESOZOIC ERA, AS CHALK PERIOD SEDIMENTS WERE ENCOUNTERED DURING CONSTRUCTION OF PETRINY STATION ON EXTENSION OF METRO LINE V.A. THE BEDROCK OUTCROPS ARE RATHER RARE; BEDROCK IS COVERED BY WEATHERED MATERIALS AND ALLUVIAL AND FLUVIAL SEDIMENTS. GEOLOGICAL CONDITIONS WERE SOMETIMES COMPLEX, WITH SOME INCIDENTS OF, FOR EXAMPLE, RUNNING SAND LENSES, WHICH CALLED FOR LAGGING OF THE TUNNEL FACE. FOR EXAMPLE, COMPARED TO SEGMENTS THERE MIGHT BE FEWER PROBLEMS ARISING FROM JOINTS, SETTLEMENT, AND SAFETY. IN THE FUTURE, THE EXISTING EXTRUDED LINING UNDER THE VITAVA RIVER WILL BE A GOOD REFERENCE POINT. THE EXTRUDED LINING IS, IN RESPECT OF ITS WATERTIGHTNESS, STILL IN A GOOD CONDITION.	0	***

THE SOUTH LSLAND LINE (EAST) WILL BE A MEDIUM CAPACITY RAILWAY COVERING APPROXIMATELY 7KM FROM ADMIRALTY STATION TO SOUTH HORIZONS STATION ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF ABERDEEN HARBOUR, WITH INTERMEDIATE STATIONS AT OCEAN PARK, WONG CHUK HANG AND LEI TUNG. WHEN COMPLETED, THE SOUTH LSLAND LINE (EAST) WILL PROVIDE FAST AND RELIABLE RAILWAY SERVICE FOR COMMUNITIES IN THE SOUTH OF HONG KONG LSLAND AND HELP EASE TRAFFIC CONGESTION AT CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS LIKE ABERDEEN TUNNEL AND THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT. THE PROJECT WAS AWARDED IN MAY 2011, CONSTRUCTION COMMENCED IN JULY 2011 AND IS PLANNED FOR SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION IN JULY 2015. THE CUT AND COVER TUNNEL CONSISTS OF TWIN, SINGLE TRACK, REINFORCED CONCRETE BOX STRUCTURES EXTENDING FROM THE INTERFACE WITH THE MINED TUNNEL TO AN INTEGRATED VENTILATION CHAMBER STRUCTURE.	0	***

ON THE SURFACE, THIS COULD BE CONSIDERED STRAIGHTFORWARD. EARTH MOVERS ABOVE GROUND HAVE NO RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR SIZE AND, WHEN IT COMES TO CHOOSING BUCKET CAPACITY PAYLOAD SIZE AND THE MOST FUEL EFFICIENT DESIGN, THERE ARE LIMITLESS OPTIONS. ELECTRIC MACHINES TEND TO BE USED MAINLY IN MASS MINING METHODS SUCH AS BLOCK AND PANEL CAVING. THE MAJOR ADVANTAGES OF ELECTRIC MACHINES ARE THEIR RUNNING AND ENERGY COSTS WHICH ARE CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN DIESELS. ELECTRIC MACHINES RUN AT 95 PER CENT EFFICIENCY WHEREAS ONLY 30 PER CENT OF THE FUELS ENERGY IN A DIESEL MOTOR IS USED IN LOADING AND TRAMMING OPERATIONS, WITH THE REST LOST AS HEAT.	0	***

THE CAVES, LIKE ANY TUNNEL STRUCTURE, CAN BE SUBJECTED TO TEMPERATURE CHANGES, CORROSION DAMAGE AND FREEZE THAW CYCLES WHICH AFFECT THE STRUCTURES DURABILITY. PROPER WATERPROOFING PREVENTS THE PENETRATION OF MOISTURE AND CHEMICALS INTO THE CONCRETE AND REINFORCING COMPONENTS, ULTIMATELY PROTECTING THE DURABILITY AND STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE CONCRETE. WHEN USING SHOTCRETE, IT IS LIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE MUCH LESS UNIFORMITY OF COVERAGE ACROSS A TRADITIONAL WATERPROOFING MEMBRANE, THAN WITH OTHER CONCRETE INSTALLATION METHODS. THE STRUCTURAL BOND THAT MUST OCCUR BETWEEN THE TRADITIONAL STICK ON WATERPROOFING MEMBRANE CAN BE REDUCED BECAUSE OF OVERSPRAY FROM THE SHOTCRETE.

THE TBM IS LAUNCHED AND ARRIVES AT GROUND LEVEL AND DRIVES UNDER SHALLOW COVER WITHOUT GROUND TREATMENT. URUP WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED AS A METHOD TO BORE TUNNELS PASSING UNDER ROADWAYS OR RAILWAYS IN ORDER TO TECHNICALLY DIFFERENTIATE OBAYASHI IN THE EVER MORE COMPETITIVE GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC TUNNELLING MARKETS. OBAYASHI INITIALLY CARRIED OUT AN EXPERIMENTAL SHAFTIESS TUNNEL AT THEIR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE WHERE A LOOM LONG BORE WITH COVER RANGING FROM 0.65M TO 2.2M WAS CONSTRUCTED USING A PROTOTYPE RECTANGULAR SHIELD EQUIPPED WITH AN EXCAVATION WIDTH OF 4.8M AND HEIGHT OF 2.1 5M. OBAYASHI CONFIRMED THE FEASIBILITY OF THE SYSTEM BY DEVELOPING A VALID LINING DESIGN UNDER VERY SHALLOW COVER. THE TBM REAPPEARED AT THE STARTING POINT AFTER SUCCESSFULLY BORING UNDER A COVER OF 1.2M WITH MAXIMUM GROUND SETTLEMENT OF ONLY 10MM OR LESS. THE TRAFFIC ABOVE THE TUNNEL WAS UNINTERRUPTED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DURATION OF TUNNEL CONSTRUCTION WORK.	0	***

WHEN CLIENTS DEVELOP PROJECTS WHERE TUNNELS ARE INVOLVED, USUALLY EXTENSIVE EVALUATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE BY CLIENT ORGANIZATIONS, AND/OR BY CONSULTANTS TO SELECT THE APPROPRIATE TUNNELING METHODS. UPON MANY OTHER FACTORS, THAT IS. SURFACE STRUCTURES, SETTLEMENT RESTRICTIONS, SITE ACCESS AND LENGTH OF TUNNEL, THE RIGHT SELECTION IS ALSO AND IMPORTANTLY DEPENDENT ON THE GEOHYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS ALONG THE TUNNEL ALIGNMENT. LN ALL CASES CLIENTS ARE THE COMBINATION OF PROJECT OWNERS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED AND SPECIALIZED CONSULTANTS. IT SHALL ALSO BE MENTIONED THAT IN ALL CASES TBM MANUFACTURERS OR SUPPLIERS ARE INVOLVED MORE OR LESS EXTENSIVELY IN THE PROCESS TO ADVISE CLIENTS, CONSULTANTS AND CONTRACTORS, IN SOME CASES, TBM MANUFACTURERS ALSO HAVE BEEN PREQUALIFIED BEFORE ENTERING THE PROCESS.	25	***

THE FIRST COVERS WATER INGRESS TO A MOUNTAIN MINE ACCESS TUNNEL, WHILE THE SECOND COVERS WATERPROOFING FOR A PRESSURIZED WATER TUNNEL. WATERTIGHTNESS WAS ACHIEVED BY POLYMER MODIFICATION. SPRAYED CONCRETE IS USED AS THE FIRST COVER LAYER IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF SOME TUNNELS; IT GENERALLY IS NOT REQUIRED TO PERFORM ANY OTHER FUNCTION. ALTHOUGH ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS HAVE RAISED AWARENESS OF THE VALUE OF SINGLE SHELL TUNNEL CONSTRUCTION, CONVENTIONAL CONSTRUCTION METHODS ARE GENERALLY USED. YET, WHILE THE DEFORMATION OF THE MOUNTAIN SUBSIDES WITH TIME, AND THE SPRAYED CONCRETE LAYER IS DISREGARDED IN TERMS OF STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS, THE INNER SHELL CAN BE CALCULATED ACCURATELY, BECAUSE IT IS UNAFFECTED. THE ROUGH SPRAYED SURFACE OF THE INITIAL LAYER SUFFICES TO ALLOW FOR GOOD ADHESIVE BONDING BETWEEN THE SPRAYED CONCRETE LAYERS; THE CONCRETE STRUCTURE CAN THEREFORE BE REGARDED AS MONOLITHIC.	12	***

WORKING IN THE TUNNEL THE AIR QUALITY WAS APPALLING WITH THE WORKERS FREQUENTLY BEING DRAGGED SENSELESS UP TO THE SURFACE TO RECOVER IN THE FRESH AIR. IN MODERN TIMES, THE VIEW IS THAT HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO ENSURE A PROTECTED AND PLEASANT WORKING ENVIRONMENT. ALTHOUGH THE PRIMARY CAUSES OF ACCIDENTS IN TUNNELS ARE SLIPS, TRIPS AND FALLS, AND MANY WOULD HAVE THE SAFETY FOCUS ON THESE, THERE ARE PASSIVE MEASURES THAT CAN BE PUT IN PLACE TO ENSURE A NON TOXIC WORKING ENVIRONMENT. AS EVACUATION IS ALWAYS THE PREFERRED MEANS OF WORKER PROTECTION, MONITORING SYSTEMS ARE KEY TO PROTECTION IN THE TUNNEL ENVIRONMENT.	0	***

TBM CUTTERS NOT ONLY HAVE TO CARRY OUT THEIR MAIN TASKS OF CUTTING OR CRUSHING MATERIALS ENCOUNTERED UP TO 400MPA, AND MOVING THEM AROUND TO REMOVAL APERTURES, THEY ALSO HAVE TO WITHSTAND ENVIRONMENTAL EXTREMES INCLUDING GROUND TEMPERATURES OF UP TO 50C, HIGH GROUNDWATER PRESSURES AND ALSO INTRUSIVE DUST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO DESIGN CUTTERS IN MATERIALS CAPABLE OF TACKLING ALL TYPES OF GROUND BUT THEY WOULD BE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE FOR NORMAL CONSTRUCTION. HOWEVER AN ATTEMPT TO SLASH COSTS BY BUYING THE CHEAPEST CUTTERS THAT WILL FIT IS UNLIKELY TO SAVE MONEY OVER THE WHOLE TUNNEL PROJECT DUE TO EARLY FAILURES AND ESPECIALLY THE COSTS INVOLVED IN UNPLANNED INTERVENTIONS FOR CUTTER CHANGES IN TERMS OF BOTH EXTRA LABOR COSTS AND PROJECT DELAYS.	11	***

WHILE THE VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL REINFORCEMENT OF SOILS HAS DEVELOPED FOLLOWING THE USE OF FULLY GROUTED BOLTS TO REINFORCE A TUNNEL CARRYING ROCK ARCH, THEY SHOULD BE DESCRIBED AS THEIR FUNCTIONALITY IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE REINFORCED ROCK ARCH AND SHOTCRETE, AND IS EASIER TO UNDERSTAND. THE THEORETICAL WORKS OF COMBARIEU SHOWED THE FUNCTIONING OF SOIL REINFORCED BY VERTICAL INCLUSIONS. THE INCLUSIONS ARE CONSIDERED AS FRICTION PILES, OR FRICTION AND END BEARING PILES. THE TRANSFER OF THE LOADS BROUGHT ABOUT BY A FILL OR A GENERAL FOUNDATION SLAB TO A SOIL REINFORCED BY INCLUSIONS OCCURS THROUGH AN ARCHING EFFECT BETWEEN THE INCLUSIONS. THE UPPER PORTION OF THE INCLUSION IS IN COMPRESSION AND IS LOADED ALONG THE TRANSFER LENGTH WHILE THE LOWER PORTION BEHAVES AS A FRICTION PILE AND RETURNS THE LOAD TO THE SURROUNDING SOIL LOCATED BETWEEN THE INCLUSIONS.	12	***

GRP BOLT TECHNOLOGY HAS SINCE FOUND WIDESPREAD APPLICATION IN MINING AND CIVIL ENGINEERING. COMPARED TO STEEL, GRP HAS ADVANTAGES THAT CAN BE TRACED TO THE PROPERTIES OF THE COMPOSITE MATERIAL. GRP BOLTS SIMPLY CONSIST OF A COMPOSITE OF RESIN AND FIBER THAT IS MANUFACTURED THROUGH THE PULTRUSION MANUFACTURING PROCESS WHICH WAS DEVELOPED IN THE EARLY 1970S. FIREP FIBRE REINFORCED POLYMER (FRP) POWERMESH WAS DEVELOPED TO COMPLY WITH STANDARD GRID APPLICATIONS WHILE PROVIDING THE ADDED BENEFITS OF DURABILITY AND CUT ABILITY.

CROSSING THE ELIZABETH RIVER, MIDTOWN TUNNEL CONNECTS PORTSMOUTH WITH NORFOLK. THE US NAVYS LARGEST INSTALLATION IS LOCATED IN NORFOLK AND INCREASINGLY RELIES ON THE TUNNEL. THE ADVANCEMENTS IN ENGINEERING SINCE THE ORIGINAL MIDTOWN TUNNEL WAS CONSTRUCTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 20TH CENTURY HAVE IMPROVED INSTALLATION TECHNIQUES AND MATERIALS ALIKE. OTHER THAN BOTH BEING IMMERSED TUBE, THE NEW AND OLD TUNNEL WILL HAVE VERY FEW SIMILARITIES. THE NEW TUNNELS APPROACH ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ALIGNMENT IS CLOSE TO THE EXISTING TUNNEL. ERC WILL USE SHEET PILE WALLS TO PROTECT THE TUNNEL AT THE APPROACHES, AND TO KEEP EXISTING SURROUNDING SOILS IN PLACE. AS THE ALIGNMENT MOVES AWAY FROM THE APPROACHES, THE NEW TUNNEL WILL BOW OUT INTO THE RIVER.	0	***

HITACHI ZOSEN HAVE DELIVERED 354 UNITS OF THESE MACHINES SO FAR. BUT SINCE THE 1980S, CLOSED SHIELDS HAVE RAPIDLY GAINED POPULARITY. THE MAJOR REASONS ARE THAT CLOSED TBMS HAVE HIGH SAFETY AND HIGHER EFFICIENCY COMPARED TO OPEN SHIELDS. SHINJUKU STATION IS ONE OF THE MAJOR STATIONS IN TOKYO, JAPAN. TRAFFIC, COMMERCE AND COMPANIES ARE CONCENTRATED AROUND THE STATION AND THE VICINITY IS PLAGUED BY SEVERE TRAFFIC JAM AND LACK OF A TRANSFER FUNCTION. THE TUNNEL PASSED THROUGH A SMALL SPACE. TO ENSURE AN ADEQUATE EARTH COVERING OF 6 7M, CONSIDERING THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF THE CROSS SECTION, A RECTANGULAR SHAPE FOR THE TUNNEL WAS ADOPTED. THIS SHIELD BODY HAS A RECTANGULAR SHAPE, AND EACH SIDE CURVED. THIS MACHINE DIGS A TUNNEL FACE WITH TWO LOADING MACHINES INSTALLED TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT, MAKES A SPACE, PUSHES INTO THE SPACE, AND BUILDS THE TUNNEL.	0	***

EAST SEA LSLAND WILL EVENTUALLY HOST A MASSIVE STEELWORKS AND ACCOMMODATE THE 20,000 WORKERS EXPECTED TO FLOCK TO THE ISLAND. THE TUNNEL WILL CARRY WATER SOUTH FROM WUCHUAN, LOCATED NORTH OF ZHANJIANG, TO FEED THE STEEL WORKS BEING CONSTRUCTED ON EAST SEA ISLAND. THE ENTIRE WATER TRANSFER SCHEME IS 26.4KM LONG. THE TUNNEL IS NEEDED TO CROSS ZHANJIANG BAY AND IS BEING DRIVEN FROM EAST SEA ISLAND, NORTHWARDS 2.7KM. THE LAUNCH SHAFT ON EAST SEA ISLAND IS CUT 26.5M DEEP AND THE RECEPTION SHAFT ON NANSHAN ISLAND REACHES 28.M. THE BOTTOM OF EACH SHAFT IS AT THE SAME DEPTH BELOW SEA LEVEL. THERE WERE TWO LIMITING FACTORS ON THE SHAFT DEPTHS, THE HEIGHT OF THE ROCK LAYER, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN COSTLY TO EXCAVATE THROUGH AND THE WATER PRESSURE.	0	***

CONSTRUCTION OF THE MANHATTAN SEGMENT OF THE ESA PROJECT REQUIRES THE EXCAVATION OF TWIN STATION CAVERNS IN ROCK, BENEATH THE EXISTING OPERATING GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL. MODERN DAY REQUIREMENTS FOR DRILL AND BLAST MANAGEMENT HAVE INCREASED AS THE AWARENESS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ENVIRONMENT IMPACTS AND LIFE QUALITY HAS GROWN. THUS, THE CRITERIA FOR BLASTING ON THE ESA PROJECT WERE NOT LIMITED TO GENUINE PHYSICAL POTENTIAL FOR DAMAGE. RATHER THE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA BECAME EVALUATED ON THE BASIS OF THE ABILITY TO PREDICT A SPECIFIC OUTCOME ASSOCIATED WITH EACH PLANNED BLAST EVENT.	0	***	
	GRRRU	KUKKONEN,J								NO DISPONIBLE, NO DISPONIBLE								INTELLIGENCE IN MODERN DRILL AND BLAST	2012	TUNNELS AND TUNNELLING INTERNATIONAL		SEP	1							1	KUKKONEN,J	THE SHIFT TOWARDS SAFETY AND SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS IN TUNNELING TAKES PLACE ON TWO TIERS. FIRSTLY, TUNNELS OFFER A WAY TO PROTECT SENSITIVE LANDSCAPES AND TO REDUCE DISRUPTION, NOISE AND VIBRATION CAUSED BY MOTORWAYS AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE SURFACE. AS BLASTING INITIATES FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE BLAST HOLE, IT IS VITAL THAT THE BURDEN AND SPACING BETWEEN THE HOLES IN THE BLAST PLANE IS AS PLANNED. IF DRILLING IS NOT ACCURATE, THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY TO CORRECT THE BLAST BY CHARGING. THEREFORE, TO MEET THE CHALLENGE, THE OPTIMAL AND LOGICAL PLACE TO BEGIN DESIGN OF THE DRILLING PATTERN IS FROM THE END OF THE ROUND, THAT IS, IN THE BLAST PLANE. THIS APPROACH, COMBINED WITH A MODERN ACCURATE DRILLING RIG, GUARANTEES OPTIMIZED EXCAVATION RESULT. DRILL PLAN DESIGN AND THE ACCURACY OF THE DRILLING EQUIPMENT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE OVERALL CONTROL AND PRODUCTIVITY OF A TUNNEL CONSTRUCTION SITE.	0	***	
	GRRRU	SHEPHERD,M								NO DISPONIBLE, NO DISPONIBLE								DEEP INTERCEPTER	2012	TUNNELS AND TUNNELLING INTERNATIONAL		SEP	1							1	SHEPHERD,M	COMPLIANCE WITH THE EUROPEAN URBAN WASTE WATER TREATMENT DIRECTIVE (UWWTD) IS TARGETED AT IMPROVING WATER QUALITY THROUGH REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF UNTREATED POLLUTED WATER THAT IS DISCHARGED INTO RIVER CATCHMENT AREAS. IN THE CASE OF THE THAMES AND RIVER LEE, 39MT OF DILUTED SEWAGE ARE DISCHARGED DIRECTLY INTO THE RIVER FROM COMBINED SEWER OVERFLOWS ANNUALLY. THE SYSTEM CANNOT COPE WITH THE CURRENT POPULATION, WHICH IS ONLY SET TO RISE. THE ORIGINAL SCHEME FAR SURPASSED ITS INTENDED DESIGN LIFE, SOMETHING TO CONSIDER FOR THE SCOPE OF THE EQUIVALENT MODERN DAY SCHEME. A MAJOR FACTOR TO ADD TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION REQUIRED IS THE 75M DEPTH OF THE TUNNEL AND SHAFTS. THIS IS TO ALLOW FOR A MINIMUM FLOW GRADIENT AND TO AVOID EXISTING UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS LONDON UNDERGROUND METRO LINES AND CABLE TUNNELS IN THE VICINITY.	0	***

THE MOST NOTABLE AND SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IS THAT ACRYLAMIDE IS A TRUE SOLUTION GROUT THAT CONTAINS NO PARTICULATES AND HAS A VISCOSITY OF ONE TO TWO CENTIPOISE (CPS) MPAS. THIS FEATURE ENABLES THE ACRYLAMIDE GROUT TO PENETRATE VERY SMALL GEOLOGICAL FEATURES THAT OTHER GROUTS COULD NOT PENETRATE AND TO SEAL SMALL CRACKS AND FISSURES WHERE GROUNDWATER SEEPAGE IS OCCURRING. THE PRODUCT ALSO HAS AN ADJUSTABLE GEL SET TIME FROM A FEW SECONDS TO SEVERAL HOURS WHICH ENABLES THE OPERATOR TO DETERMINE THE PRODUCT TRAVEL BEFORE IT FORMS A GEL.

SPARVO TUNNEL WAS ORIGINALLY SPECIFIED TO BE EXCAVATED BY TRADITIONAL METHODS, IN THE SAME WAY AS VAL DI SAMBRO. THE DECISION TO CHANGE WAS AN ECONOMICAL ONE, ACCORDING TO TOTO ASSISTANT ENGINEERS MAURIZIO PEPINO AND GIANLUCA COMM. THIS IS BECAUSE PROGRESS ON VAL DI SAMBRO HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY SLOW. THE BELT CONVEYOR IS SEALED WITHIN ITS OWN TUBE TO PREVENT THE GAS ESCAPING, AND THERE IS AN ARRAY OF SENSORS AND MONITORING EQUIPMENT TO ENSURE THE GAS DOES NOT BUILD UP. THE SHIELD WAS ALSO DESIGNED WITH A CONICAL SHAPE WITH THE EXCAVATION DIAMETER LARGER THAN THE REAR SHIELD DIAMETER.	0	***

OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES, THE TUNNELING MARKET HAS BEEN GLOBALLY CONSTANT WITH SOME BETTER AND SOME WORSE YEARS, BUT WITH NO REAL BOOM NOR ANY REAL STOP. THE MAIN FACTORS CONTRIBUTING POSITIVELY TO TUNNELING PROJECTS IN EUROPE ARE, ON ONE HAND, THE MOVE TOWARDS EUROPEAN INTEGRATION, WHICH CAN ONLY BE MADE THROUGH COMMUNICATION OF PEOPLE AND GOODS AND THE AWARENESS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE NEED OF DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE. THE WAY CHOSEN IN SWITZERLAND TO FINANCE NEAT HAS BEEN TOTALLY DIFFERENT, AS THEY ARE FINANCED FROM A SEPARATE BUDGET WITH DIFFERENT SORTS OF INCOMES THAT HAVE BEEN SECURED FROM THE BEGINNING. IT IS CLEAR TO EVERY ONE THAT ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS IS TO MAKE OUR CITIES DENSER. THIS CAN MEAN MORE SKYSCRAPERS, BUT MAYBE EARTH SCRAPERS USING THE UNDERGROUND SPACE.	0	***

AT 64KM LONG IT WILL BE THE LONGEST UNDERGROUND RAILWAY CONNECTION IN THE WORLD; A PIONEERING WORK OF ENGINEERING. THE BBT WILL BE PRIMARILY FOR FREIGHT TRANSPORT, ALLOWING A SHIFT OF TRAFFIC FROM ROAD TO RAIL. PASSENGER TRAINS WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO TRAVEL THROUGH THE TUNNEL. DUE TO AN ALMOST HORIZONTAL GRADIENT, TUNNEL TRAINS WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO COPE WITH STEEP UP AND DOWN SLOPES. THE EXISTING RAIL CORRIDOR RUNNING OVER THE ALPS IS THE MOST OVERLOADED TRAFFIC CORRIDOR, AND IS CONTINUALLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT. IT HAS INCLINES OF UP TO 28MM/RN, RESULTING IN SLOW MOVEMENT OF RAIL FREIGHT. THE BBT WILL REMOVE THE STEEP INCLINES, AND SO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE VOLUME OF FREIGHT ALONG THE EUROPEAN NORTH SOUTH CORRIDOR. IT WAS NECESSARY TO PRODUCE A GUIDE DESIGN, TO CREATE A BASIC PLATFORM TO PROVIDE A VERY CLEAR APPROACH IN HOW TO DEAL WITH THE PROJECT.	0	***

AS THE EUROZONE FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL SECTORS FACE ANOTHER CRUNCH MOMENT TO SEE IF GREECE HAS BEEN AUSTERE ENOUGH TO DESERVE IT IS FINAL ROUND OF BAILOUT LOANS, TUNNELING, WHILE COMPETITIVE, IS STILL STRONG. IT APPEARS THAT, AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED, THE ALPS CONSTITUTE THE MOST ACTIVE CENTER FOR TUNNELING IN THE REGION, WITH OTHER LOCALIZED AREAS OF ACTIVITY, SUCH AS THE BOSPHORUS STRAIT. A NEW ROAD TUNNEL CROSSING DESIGN CONTRACT WAS AWARDED FOR THIS BOTTLENECK LAST MONTH. COLLABORATIVE, INTERNATIONAL FUNDING BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO PROJECTS, AS WELL AS AN INFLUX OF FOREIGN BUSINESS TO THESE REGIONS HAVE PROVIDED THE MEANS, AND THE REQUIREMENT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES.

THE MISTAKE WAS THAT NATM WAS TURNED INTO COOKBOOK OF THE ENGINEERING CODES AND STANDARDS BELOVED OF THE BRITISH ENGINEER AND HAS SINCE EVOLVED INTO A METHODOLOGY THAT WOULD MAKE DELIA SMITH PROUD. THE FUNDAMENTAL BUT TRUE CRITICISM OF THE NATM IS THAT IT WAS NEVER CLEARLY DEFINED AS TO WHAT IT IS AND IS ATTEMPTING TO ACHIEVE. UNFORTUNATELY THE SAME CAN BE EQUALLY APPLIED TO SCL. UNFORTUNATELY, SCL DEVELOPMENT APPEARS TO HAVE CONCENTRATED MAINLY ON THE SPRAYED CONCRETE LINING ITSELF. ON LARGELY SPURIOUS HEALTH AND SAFETY GROUNDS THE USE OF LATTICE GIRDERS AND STEEL MESH HAS BEEN DITCHED AND AS A RESULT WE NOW HAVE SCL LININGS DOUBLE THE THICKNESS AND TWICE THE CONCRETE STRENGTH, TOTALLY RELIANT ON CHEMICAL ADDITIVES AND QUALITY CONTROL OF THE MIX AND APPLICATION FOR HOLDING IT UP IN THE ROOF.	0	***

THESE HAVE BEEN COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES TO BORED TUNNELS AND WHERE SPACE CONSTRAINTS IN AN URBAN AREA RESTRICT THE USE OF LARGE OPEN EARTHWORK CUTTINGS. CUT AND COVER TUNNELS CAN BE CONSTRUCTED IN ONE OF TWO WAYS. THESE ARE BOTTOM UP AND TOP DOWN. BOTTOM UP IS THE SIMPLER SYSTEM, WHERE THE WALLS ARE CONSTRUCTED, EXCAVATION OF THE BOX IS CARRIED OUT, THE BASE IS INSTALLED AND THE COVER OR PERMANENT PROPS ARE CONSTRUCTED. DIAPHRAGM WALLS ARE A HEAVY DUTY WALL THAT TEND TO BE EMPLOYED WHERE A STIFFER WALL IS REQUIRED OR WHERE THE DEPTH OF WALL PRECLUDES USE OF SECANT PILED WALLS DUE TO THE VERTICALITY AND DEPTH.	0	***

THEY ARE ON THE CRITICAL PATH FOR THE WORK AND DELAYS HERE HAVE BEEN THE MAIN FACTOR IN STRETCHING OUT THE PROJECT SCHEDULE. SPACE LIMITS BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS MEAN THE FINISHED STATION HERE IS 11M WIDE, JUST UNDER 13M DURING EXCAVATION. TO FIT THE LINE IN, THE TRACKS HAVE TO BE STACKED ONE OVER THE OTHER INSTEAD OF SIDE BY SIDE. THE BOX IS THEREFORE DEEPER AT 31M, IF NOT MUCH MORE THAN VIJZELGRACHT. FULL EXCAVATION DEPTH REACHED 33M. INSTALLATION WAS DONE USING AN OBSERVATIONAL METHOD WITH MODIFICATIONS TO THE INSTALLED PATTERN MADE AS MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN, AND CORE SAMPLES RETRIEVED DURING THE SUBCONTRACTORS WORK.	0	***

THE ACTUAL THRUST CAN ONLY BE FOUND BY MEASUREMENT. ACTION AND REACTION ARE EQUAL AND OPPOSITE SO THE THRUST PROVIDED TO THE AIR CAN BE EVALUATED BY MEASURING THE REACTIVE FORCE ON THE FAN, AS SPECIFIED IN ISO 13350. ON A FULLY REVERSIBLE FAN THIS APPROACH DOES NOT GIVE ANY REAL BENEFIT. SHOULD THE DEFLECTION VANES BE ATTACHED AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE FAN ENDS, THE PRESSURE DROP COULD BE REASONABLY REDUCED BUT ONLY A PROPORTION OF THE SPREADING PLUME WOULD BE CAPTURED AND TURNED, SO AGAIN THE BENEFIT IS REDUCED. THE MOJET HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO HAVE A SOUND PHYSICAL BASIS, AND THE CFD ANALYSIS HAS SUPPORTED THIS. HOWEVER, TRUE CONFIRMATION CAN ONLY COME WITH A REAL INSTALLATION, OR IN A TEST CARRIED OUT AT A 1:1 SCALE.	17	***

THE UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION EFFORT HAS SWITCHED TO FINAL LINING. CONCRETING WORKS ARE ALSO UNDERWAY FOR THE POWERHOUSE CAVERN FOUNDATIONS TO HOLD FOUR MASSIVE PUMP TURBINE UNITS. BUT THE MAIN CHALLENGE WAS THE GEOLOGY FOR THE UNDERGROUND WORKS. THE GEOLOGY COMPRISES RELATIVELY WEAK SEDIMENTARY ROCK WITH SOME FAULTS AND FRACTURES IN THE COMPLEX POWERHOUSE AREA, LONG TERM CREEP BEHAVIOR AND THE RELATIVELY LOW INSITU STRESS AT DEPTH FOR THE TWIN POWER TUNNELS. THE INGULA PUMPED STORAGE SCHEME HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO WORK UNDER A RATED HEAD OF 441 M BETWEEN TWO RESERVOIRS, THE UPPER BEDFORD AND LOWER BRAMHOEK, BOTH NEW IMPOUNDED WATER BODES AND POSITIONED APPROXIMATELY 6 KM APART. THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM WILL HOLD 21GWH, OR ALMOST 16 HOURS OF ENERGY GENERATION, ALTHOUGH IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT 20 HOURS OF PUMPING TO CHARGE THE SYSTEM.	0	***

ACTIVE ARCH LINING REFERS TO A LINING THAT PRODUCES IMMEDIATE CONFINEMENT OF THE SURROUNDING GROUND, WITHOUT WAITING FOR IT TO DEFORM AND PUSH DOWN ON THE EXTRADOS. A LINING OF THIS TYPE IS FORMED BY ERECTING AN ARCH OF PREFABRICATED REINFORCED CONCRETE SEGMENTS. THIS IS IMMEDIATELY RENDERED A LOAD BEARING STRUCTURE BY TWO OPPOSING FLAT JACKS INSERTED IN THE KEY SEGMENTS WHICH ARTIFICIALLY APPLY THE AXIAL COMPRESSIVE STRESS NEEDED TO CONTRAST THE LOADS TO BE BORN.	12	***

WHILE TUNNELS MAKE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO MODERN TRANSPORT NETWORKS, THEY ALSO POSE SOME SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING THEM FROM FIRE. YET THAT PROTECTION IS AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT, GIVEN THAT THE LIMITED SCOPE FOR ESCAPE AND A LACK OF EASY ACCESS MEANS THAT A MAJOR TUNNEL BLAZE CAN HAVE POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS RESULTS. PASSIVE FIRE PROTECTION WILL SLOW THE SPREAD OF FIRE AND LIMIT THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY HIGH TEMPERATURES, THUS PROVIDING MORE TIME FOR OCCUPANTS TO ESCAPE. THEY INHIBIT THE ESCALATION OF A FIRE AND CAN ALSO BE USED TO PROTECT ELEMENTS OF AN ACTIVE SYSTEM SUCH AS POWER SUPPLIES OR PIPE WORK. MANY PASSIVE MEASURES ALSO OFFER THERMAL AND ACOUSTIC INSULATION BENEFITS, WHICH MAKES THEM EVEN MORE ATTRACTIVE.	0	***

THE IMPORTANCE OF PASSIVE FIRE PROTECTION IS OFTEN NOT JUST A MATTER OF REDUCING RECOVERY COSTS BY PROTECTING THE TUNNEL STRUCTURE. MOST TYPES ONLY COME INTO PLAY AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES WHEN LIFE IN THE TUNNEL IS, HOPEFULLY, SAVED. ANOTHER APPROACH IN CREATING FIREPROOFING BARRIERS IS SPRAYING FIRE RESISTANT MATERIAL ONTO THE SURFACE TO BE PROTECTED. ADVANTAGES INCLUDE A CLOSE FIT TO THE STRUCTURE OR SERVICE LINES TO BE PROTECTED. USING ADVANCED ROBOTIC APPLICATORS SUCH AS THE MEYCOS ROBOJET, APPLYING THE CORRECT THICKNESS OF LINING IN THE CORRECT PLACES CAN ALSO SAVE COSTS AND ACHIEVES TOLERANCES THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE WITH MANUALLY APPLIED PRODUCTS. APPLICATION RATES AT 150 250M2 PER HOUR DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIED THICKNESS.

THE SPRAWLING CITY NEEDS IT. THE VARIOUS PHASES OF THE DELHI METRO, WHILE PRIORITIZING VITAL DISTRICTS OF THE CITY, HAVE BEEN PLANNED IN A WEB CONFIGURATION. PHASES ONE AND TWO FOCUSED ON CONSTRUCTING THE RADIAL ROUTES SPREADING OUTWARDS FROM A CENTER POINT. PHASE THREE WILL ADD CIRCLES TO CONNECT THESE RADIAL ROUTES AND PHASE FOUR, IF IT GOES AHEAD, WILL EXTEND THE RADIALS WHILE ADDING MORE CIRCLE ROUTES. THE 30 TUNNEL DRIVES CALLED FOR THIS RECORD BREAKING NUMBER OF TBMS WORKING IN A SINGLE CITY. OF THE 124KM TO BE ADDED TO THE METRO IN THIS PHASE, 35KM WERE UNDERGROUND. DRIVEN 16KM BYTBM AND 2.8KM BY NATM. THE 20 UNDERGROUND STATIONS WERE CONSTRUCTED BY CUT AND COVER, TWICE AS MANY AS IN PHASE ONE.	0	***

HOWEVER, FURTHER EVALUATIONS ARE NEEDED DUE TO DIFFICULTIES IN CONTROLLING THE AMOUNT OF FOAM AS WELL AS DIFFICULTIES IN COMPARING ABRASIVENESS RESULTS FROM SAMPLES WITH DIFFERENT GRAIN SIZES IN THE BALL MILL TEST. THE TEST IS DESIGNED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HYPERBARIC CONDITIONS, AS THE TEST CHAMBER CAN BE PRESSURIZED UP TO SIX BAR.

TUNNEL CONSTRUCTION WAS SPLIT INTO FOUR CONTRACTS, OF WHICH CC WAS AWARDED THE GREAT MAJORITY. CONTRACT VA ALSO INCLUDES SLOPE STABILIZATION, SLOPE PROTECTION AND PORTAL CONSTRUCTION AT THE SOUTH PORTAL, AND AN 85M IONG CONNECTION TO THE ACCESS ADIT. SIMILARLY CONTRACT VB INCLUDES CONSTRUCTION OF THE NORTH PORTAL. THE TUNNEL IS ALIGNED APPROXIMATELY NORTH SOUTH ON A STRAIGHT ROUTE FOR ITS ENTIRE LENGTH THROUGH THE PIR PANJAL PASS THAT CONNECTS THE BANIHAL VALLEY AT THE SOUTH END WITH THE KASHMIR VALLEY AT THE NORTH END.

LIKE ALL MODERN TRANSPORT TUNNELS, THE LOGAN TUNNEL WAS CLAD WITH INTERIOR WALL PANELS, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF WHICH WERE CAREFULLY SPECIFIED IN THE DESIGN DOCUMENTS. THE APPLICATION OF THE REFLECTIVE PANELS IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A HIGHER DEGREE OF AMBIENCE IN THE TUNNEL, IMPROVING THE VISUAL PERFORMANCE OF DRIVERS. WITH REFLECTIVE WALLS THE COMFORT LEVEL OF THE DRIVER IS IMPROVED, AS THE DARK TUNNELING EFFECT IS REDUCED. THE MEASUREMENT TOOL USED WOULD BE THE SAME LUMINANCE METER THAT WAS BEING USED TO TEST AND COMMISSION THE CARRIAGEWAY LUMINANCE VALUES. MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN FOR LUMINANCE ON BARRIER SURFACE ADJACENT TO VEHICLE, CARRIAGEWAY IN FRONT OF VEHICLE, BRIGHT SPOTS ON WALL ADJACENT TO VEHICLE AND THE HEADLAMPS IN LOW AND HIGH BEAM. THE VEHICLE WAS THEN MOVED 10M CLOSER TO OBSERVER POSITION AND THE MEASUREMENTS TAKEN AGAIN.	1	***

ONE ASPECT IS TO INSTALL HIGH VOLTAGE CABLES UNDERGROUND TO RENEW THE GRID IN MAJOR URBAN AREAS, STARTING WITH LONDON. THE SITE IS ON A NATURAL SLOPE. PREPARATION OF THE SITE INCLUDED SOME DEMOLITION AND THE CREATION OF A SUITABLE LEVEL SURFACE BY RETAINED BACKFILLING, AND SO CREATING ENOUGH STORAGE SPACE. THE INITIAL LONDON POWER TUNNELS PROJECT HAS SEVERAL STRATEGIC PURPOSES FOR NATIONAL GRID. FIRSTLY IT WILL RENEW THE AGING MAIN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY ROUTES IN THE CAPITAL, REPLACING CABLES OF OLD DESIGN THAT ARE NOW APPROACHING THE END OF THEIR LIFE. SECONDLY IT WILL PROVIDE FOR THE CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING POWER NEEDS OF THE CONURBATION. HEAVY LIFTING PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN THE SET UP AND OPERATION OF THE FADE ROAD AND OTHER DRIVE SHAFT SITES OF THE PROJECT.	0	***	
	GRRRU	ROBINSON,B								NO DISPONIBLE, NO DISPONIBLE								CHILE MINE RESCUE	2012	TUNNELS AND TUNNELLING INTERNATIONAL		MAY	1							1	ROBINSON,B	THE ATACAMA REGION IN SOUTH AMERICA IS A VERY LARGE MINING AREA PRODUCING GREAT VOLUMES OF COPPER AND GOLD, WHICH TOGETHER ARE THE LARGEST GDP PROVIDERS IN CHILE. LABOR COMES FROM NOT ONLY CHILE BUT ALSO THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES. THE MINERS ARE DRAWN TO THE HIGHER PAYING LOCATIONS WHICH ARE ALSO THE MOST DANGEROUS. THE SCENE OF THE 2010 ACCIDENT WAS THE SAN JOSE MINE IN NORTHERN CHILE. IT STARTED LIFE IN 1889 WITH THE EXISTING HEADGEAR OVER THE ACCESS SHAFT HAVING BEEN IN PLACE SINCE AROUND 1910. THE ROPES FOR THIS DO NOT GO DOWN THE FULL DEPTH OF THE MINE, SO WERE NO GOOD FOR THE RESCUE FROM THE DEEP LEVELS. THE 8.5KM LONG RAMP USED TO ACCESS THE MINE FACE HAD COMPLETELY FAILED. IT IS BELIEVED THAT OVER MINING OF THE RAMP STRUCTURE ITSELF LED TO THE COLLAPSE. IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE THE MINE MORE PRODUCTIVE, THE OPERATOR HAD RE MINED THE RAMPS SUPPORT STRUCTURE FOR ANY GOLD OR COPPER LEFT IN IT.	0	***

IT IS WELL KNOWN FROM TUNNELING EXPERIENCE THAT EVEN SMALL CONVERGENCES OF 100 200MM, WHICH WOULD NOT BE PROBLEMATIC IN CONVENTIONAL TUNNELING, MAY LEAD TO MAJOR PROBLEMS BOTH IN THE MACHINE AND IN THE BACK UP AREA. THE COMPUTATIONAL MODEL WAS KEPT DELIBERATELY SIMPLE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT AXIAL SYMMETRY AND THE MOHR COULOMB YIELD CRITERION. CONCERNING THE RISK OF SHIELD JAMMING, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO HAVE INFORMATION ON FRICTIONAL FORCE WHEN DESIGNING A NEW TBM AND WHEN ASSESSING THE FEASIBILITY OF A PROPOSED TBM DRIVE. THE SUITABILITY OF THE NOMOGRAMS FOR A QUICK AND COST EFFECTIVE PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF A TBM DRIVE IN SQUEEZING GROUND WILL BE SHOWN BY MEANS OF AN APPLICATION EXAMPLE CONCERNING A COMMON SITUATION WHICH CONFRONTS THE TUNNELING ENGINEER ON A REGULAR BASIS IN THE PLANNING PHASE.	8	***

JET GROUTING INVOLVES INSERTING A HOLLOW DRILL BIT LIKE A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE INTO THE GROUND AND INJECTING CEMENT GROUT AT PRESSURE SO THAT IT MIXES WITH SURROUNDING MATERIAL. VICTORIA STATION UPGRADE IS BEING DELIVERED BY JOINT VENTURE CONTRACTOR TAYLOR WOODROW BAM NUTGALL (TWBN) UNDER A DESIGN AND CONSTRUCT CONTRACT, WITH SHARED GAIN/PAIN. CONSULTANT MOTI MACDONALD DEVELOPED LUS CONCEPT DESIGN, HELPED STEER THE PROJECT THROUGH THE STATUTORY PROCESSES AND IS NOW WORKING AS THE DESIGNER FOR TWBN. CONSTRUCTION IS TAKING PLACE SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OF THE UK CAPITALS BUSIEST TRANSPORT INTERCHANGES. THE SQUARE CROSS SECTION ACHIEVED USING HAND MINING ALSO PROVIDES THE SAME PASSENGER CAPACITY AS A CYLINDRICAL TUNNEL BUT WITH A SAVING ON WIDTH. FRAMES WILL BE INSTALLED AT 650MM CENTERS.	0	***	
	GRRRU	STROUD,S								NO DISPONIBLE, NO DISPONIBLE								TUNNELLING INDUCED SETTLEMENTS IN LONDON CLAY	2012	TUNNELS AND TUNNELLING INTERNATIONAL		APR	1							1	STROUD,S	THE BASIC CONCEPT OF EFFECTS OF TUNNELING ON BUILDINGS DESCRIBES THE TRANSVERSE SETTLEMENT TROUGH CAUSED. THE TROUGH CONFORMS TO A CLASSICAL GAUSSIAN EQUATION THAT CAN BE DERIVED FROM A FUNDAMENTAL PARAMETER IN SETTLEMENT ASSESSMENTS, THE VOLUME LOSS. A VOLUME LOSS OF AROUND ONE PER CENT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN MANY CASES IN LONDON CLAY. A NUMBER OF FACTORS CONTROL VOLUME LOSS, BUT CONTROLLING THE FACE PRESSURE IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN CONTROLLING GROUND MOVEMENT. MIXED GROUND CONDITIONS CAN GIVE RISE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FACE PRESSURE BUT LONDON CLAY IS MORE UNIFORM AND IT IS EASIER TO KEEP FACE PRESSURES BROADLY CONSTANT. CENTRIFUGE MODELING TESTS HAVE EXAMINED THE MODIFICATION FACTOR IN SOME DETAIL. STRUCTURES OF DIFFERENT STIFFNESS AND TUNNELS AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS AND POSITIONS IN RELATION TO THE STRUCTURE WERE IDEALIZED. IF EXTRACTING FLUID FROM THE ANNULUS OF THE MODELED TUNNEL ACCURATELY CONTROLS VOLUME LOSSES, GREENFIELD SETTLEMENT TROUGHS CAN BE PRODUCED WHICH, WITH THE ADDITION OF A FLEXIBLE BUILDING, ARE SIMILAR.	11	***

IN RENOVATION WORK, THE GROUND MAY PLAY A PART, BUT THE MAIN CONSIDERATION IS THE STATE OF THE EXISTING UNDERGROUND STRUCTURE AND WHETHER IT CAN BE MADE TO MEET CHANGING NEEDS AND MODERN STANDARDS. IN MANY CIRCUMSTANCES IT MAY BE TEMPTING TO SOLVE SUCH PROBLEMS BY RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE, BUT READILY AVAILABLE, NEW BUILD. INDEED THIS MAY BE THE ONLY ADEQUATE SOLUTION, BUT WITH EXPERIENCE AND INNOVATIVE THINKING, THE PROBLEMS OF DETERIORATING OR INADEQUATE TUNNELS CAN BE RESOLVED MORE ECONOMICALLY. SEWERS CAN BE A MAJOR RENOVATION NEED, ESPECIALLY IN OLDER URBAN AREAS WHERE THE ASSET MAY WELL BE OVER A CENTURY OLD AND BRICK BUILT. IN MORE RECENTLY DEVELOPED SEWERAGE SYSTEMS, OFTEN IN TROPICAL OR SUB TROPICAL CLIMATES, THE HIGH AMBIENT TEMPERATURES CAN INCREASE CORROSION RATES OF A CONCRETE FABRIC, NECESSITATING LINING WITH A LESS CORRODIBLE MATERIALS, SUCH AS GLASS FIBER REINFORCED PLASTIC (GRP), OR REPLACEMENT.	0	***	
	GRRRU	RAMONI,M								NO DISPONIBLE, NO DISPONIBLE								TBMS IN SQUEEZING GROUND CONDITIONS	2012	TUNNELS AND TUNNELLING INTERNATIONAL		MAR	4							1	RAMONI,M	THE EXPRESSION SQUEEZING GROUND IS COMMONLY USED WITH REFERENCE TO LARGE DEFORMATIONS OF THE OPENING AFTER EXCAVATION. IF AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO HINDER THE GROUND DEFORMATIONS, A HIGH GROUND PRESSURE MAY DEVELOP UPON THE TUNNEL SUPPORT ENDANGERING ITS STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY. THE SPACE AVAILABLE FOR GROUND DEFORMATIONS IN TBM TUNNELING IS VERY LIMITED, DUE TO THE FIXED GEOMETRY AND THE LIMITED FLEXIBILITY OF THE TUNNELING EQUIPMENT (TBM AND BACK UP). THE PERFORMANCE OF A TBM IS THE RESULT OF A COMPLEX INTERACTION BETWEEN THE MAIN SYSTEM COMPONENTS GROUND, TUNNELING EQUIPMENT (TBM AND BACK UP) AND TUNNEL SUPPORT. THE ADVANCE RATE INFLUENCES THIS INTERACTION TOO AND IS NOT ONLY A RESULT OF IT. IN ORDER TO RESUME TBM OPERATION, THE THRUSTING SYSTEM MUST BE ABLE TO COPE WITH THE FORCES ACTING UPON THE CUTTER HEAD AND THE SHIELD. IN ORDER TO MOVE THE TBM FORWARD, THE EFFECTIVE AVAILABLE THRUST FORCE MUST BE HIGHER THAN THE FRICTIONAL RESISTANCE (STATIC FRICTION).	12	***

MAJOR SOURCES OF NOISE IN TUNNELING ARE DRILLING EQUIPMENT, CUTTERHEADS, PNEUMATIC AND HYDRAULIC POWER TOOLS, FANS AND TO A LESSER EXTENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS. DUST CAN BE CATEGORIZED INTO INHALABLE DUST, RESPIRABLE DUST INTO GAS EXCHANGE REGIONS OF LUNGS OR THE MORE SERIOUS RESPIRABLE CRYSTALLINE DUST AT 0.1 MG PER M 3 LIMIT.	0	***

A RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATION REQUIRES INVESTIGATION OF THE ACTUAL POSITION AND THE SEPARATION OF THE IMPACT OF OTHER CHANGES FROM THE CHANGE UNDER CONSIDERATION. WHILE THE PROCESS OF RETROSPECTIVELY UNPICKING STRANDS OF CAUSE AND EFFECT FROM THE FINAL POSITION CAN BE COMPLEX, THE PARTIES ARE AT LEAST AWARE OF THE FINAL OUTCOME. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THERE WILL BE A CONTRACTUAL ENTITLEMENT TO AN EXTENSION OF TIME OR PROLONGATION WILL DEPEND UPON THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONTRACT AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES IDENTIFIED FOR THE CHANGE AND OTHER IMPACTS OCCURRING DURING THE PERIOD. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM REMAINS SUFFICIENTLY CURRENT BOTH THE CONTRACTOR AND THE ENGINEER/PROJECT MANAGER MUST PERFORM.	1	***

IN THE UK, A SERIOUS FIRE OCCURRED IN THE CHANNEL TUNNEL RAIL LINKS (CTRL) THAMES TUNNEL ON 16 AUGUST 2005. TWO CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WERE KILLED IN A FIRE THAT BROKE OUT IN A DIESEL LOCOMOTIVE DRAWING A CONSTRUCTION TRAIN SOUTH THROUGH THE 2.5KM LONG, 8.15M OD EASTERN BORE OF THE TUNNEL. AS EVIDENCED BY THE INCIDENTS IN THE NIAGARA RIVER DIVERSION TUNNEL, VEGA DEL CIEGO TUNNEL, CTRL THAMES TUNNEL AND OTHERS, FIRES CAN GENERATE A SIGNIFICANT VOLUME OF SMOKE, EVEN WITH RELATIVELY LOW HEAT RELEASE RATES THAT DO NOT THREATEN THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE TUNNEL LININGS. ALTHOUGH THE PROVISION OF EMERGENCY VENTILATION IS NOT SPECIFIED BY THE RELEVANT TUNNELING STANDARDS, THE NUMBER OF RECENT TUNNEL FIRES AND EXPLOSIONS AS WELL AS THEIR RESULTING CASUALTIES SHOULD GIVE US REASON TO RECONSIDER.	0	***

SINCE THE UNDERLYING DATA IS RELATIVELY OLD AND MOSTLY FROM TUNNELS WITH DIAMETERS <6.0 7.0 M, THIS MATERIAL IS NO LONGER UP TO DATE. ALSO, THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS SINCE 1990 IN TBM TECHNOLOGY, IN PARTICULAR AS FAR AS CUTTERS ARE CONCERNED (MATERIAL, SHAPE, AND DIAMETER OF DISKS). THE CHANGED SITUATION HAS MOTIVATED A RESEARCH GROUP CONSISTING OF FIVE UNIVERSITY INSTITUTES FROM THE ALPINE REGION TO PICK UP THE TOPIC OF THE PREDICTION OF PENETRATION RATE AND CUTTER WEAR, WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF DEVELOPING A COMPLETELY NEW OR IMPROVED PREDICTION MODEL. HOWEVER, PENETRATION RATE IS ONLY ONE ALTHOUGH THE FIRST AND MAJORPARAMETER TO CALCULATE ADVANCE RATE. THE PREDICTION OF ADVANCE RATE IS ESSENTIALLY A TASK OF CONSTRUCTION PLANNING, IN WHICH ASPECTS OF MACHINE TECHNOLOGY, OPERATION, ORGANISATION AND LOGISTICS MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. A SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD CALCULATION IS INSUFFICIENT FOR DOING THIS: CALCULATION MUST HAPPEN IN ITERATIVE STEPS. ON THE BASIS OF A DOCTORAL THESIS ACCEPTED IN 2004 AT THE UNIVERSITY OF INNSBRUCK, AN ENGINEERING FIRM SPECIALISING IN CONSTRUCTION PLANNING AND ECONOMICS 11 HAS DEVELOPED THE SOFTWARE SIMTUNNEL PRO 2.0 MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO CALCULATE ADVANCE RATE IN A COMPREHENSIBLE WAY, TAKING ALL CONCEIVABLE INFLUENCES AND BASIC CONDITIONS INTO ACCOUNT.	9	***

A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT IN ROAD TUNNEL VENTILATION HAS BEEN JET FANS. THESE WORK MAINLY BY INDUCING AIRFLOW AROUND THEM, MULTIPLYING THE AIR ACTUALLY PASSED THROUGH EACH FAN. THE WIDE RANGE OF AXIAL AND JET FANS AVAILABLE FROM HOWDEN VENTILATOREN FEATURES CORROSION PROTECTION AND FLAMEPROOF MOTORS, WITH AUTO VARIABLE PITCH OR VARIABLE SPEED DRIVES, AND POTENTIAL FOR UP TO 100 PER CENT REVERSE FLOW. THE BANANA JET, AVAILABLE FROM WITT & SOHN OF GERMANY, IMPROVES ON INSTALLATION EFFICIENCY BY HAVING A HOUSING THAT DIRECTS THE JET TOWARDS THE TUNNEL CENTRELINE AT AN ANGLE OF SEVEN DEGREES INSTEAD OF A STRAIGHT TUBE. CONNOLS AIR OF SINGAPORE SUPPLIES THE OLS SD60 SMOKE DAMPERS PARTICULARLY FOR METRO SYSTEMS. STAINLESS STEEL MOVING PARTS ARE EMPLOYED TO PREVENT SEIZURE, WITHIN A GALVANIZED STEEL STRUCTURE.	0	***

THE RESULTS FROM THE SIMULATION BY THE INDUSTRY STANDARD APPROACH SHOW THE VELOCITY MAGNITUDE IN A CROSS SECTION HALFWAY BETWEEN A PAIR OF FANS AND THE EXTENT OF THE SMOKE SPREADING. THE RESULTS FROM THE SIMULATION FROM THE BEST PRACTICE APPROACH SUGGEST THAT THE SPREADING RATE OF THE JET MOMENTUM IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE A CONSISTENT, DOWN TUNNEL VENTILATION FLOW.

TECHNICALLY, CHANGE MAY RESULT FROM A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS THAT MODIFY THE SCOPE, IMPLEMENTATION OR RISK PROFILE OF A PROJECT, WITH CONSEQUENTIAL IMPACTS ON COST AND PROGRAM. FOR MAJOR UNDERGROUND PROJECTS, PARTICULARLY IN URBAN AREAS, EARLY CONSULTATION WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS IS IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CHANGES IN LATER STAGES OF THE PROJECT. THE USE OF GEOTECHNICAL BASELINE REPORTS (GBR) IS A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT THAT PROVIDES A FIXED CONTRACTUAL BASELINE FOR GROUND CONDITIONS. THE APPLICATION OF INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICE IN THE PRE CONSTRUCTION STAGES OF A PROJECT WILL HELP MINIMIZE CHANGE. ENGINEERING CONTRACTS INVARIABLY INCLUDE A CLAUSE EXPRESSLY PERMITTING THE CLIENT TO INSTRUCT A CHANGE AND STATING HOW THE COST OF THE CHANGE IS TO BE DETERMINED.	2	***

G. HOLTER AND H. O. HOGNESTAD OF BASF MEYCO FOCUS ON THE USE OF MODERN COST EFFECTIVE METHODS AND MATERIAL TECHNOLOGY FOR PRE INJECTIONS IN SHALLOW TUNNELS. THE BASIC IDEA OF PRE INJECTION IS TO TREAT THE GROUND PRIOR TO THE EXCAVATION BY INJECTING A GROUT INTO THE GROUND THROUGH DRILLHOLES AND PUMPING AT PRESSURE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND A PRE INJECTION SCHEME IN TUNNELING AS A SEQUENCE OF DECISIONS MADE AT SEVERAL STAGES IN THE INJECTION CYCLE. MANAGEMENT OF THE INJECTION WORKS IS THEREFORE A CRUCIAL FACTOR IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST EFFECTIVENESS. THE PROCESS OF BLEEDING, IN WHICH THE CEMENT GRAINS SEPARATE FROM THE GROUT MIX AND CLOG THE ENTRANCES TO THE FINE JOINTS, DOES NOT OCCUR WITH A STABLE GROUT MIX.

IN THE UK THE FIRST STEEL FIBRE SEGMENTALLY LINED TUNNEL WAS THE 1.4KM BAGGAGE TUNNEL AT LONDON HEATHROW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN 1995. THIS WAS A DESIGN AND BUILD PROJECT BY MILLER TUNNELING, NOW MORGAN SINDALL, IN WHICH THE TRADITIONAL REINFORCEMENT CAGE WAS COMPLETELY REMOVED AND DRAMIX STEEL FIBERS USED. ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS WAS THE POTENTIAL OF TRAIN DERAILING AND IMPACTING THE NEW TUNNEL LINING, SO IT WAS DECIDED THAT A LINING INCORPORATING STEEL FIBERS WITH TRADITIONAL REINFORCEMENT WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION. MANY PROJECTS FOLLOWED IN THE 1990S, MAINLY IN THE UTILITY SECTOR, AND INTO THE NEW MILLENNIUM WITH TWO MAJOR PROJECTS THE TUNNELING WORKS FOR THE NEW HEATHROW TERMINAL 5 (T5 HEX) AND THE CHANNEL TUNNEL RAIL PART 2 (CTRL).	5	***

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AACHEN RWTH, HERRENKNECHT HAS BEEN DEVELOPING A PIPE JOINT SENSING AND MONITORING SYSTEM CALLED THE ONLINE LOAD CONTROL (OLC). IT HAS ALREADY BEEN USED IN SOME PIPE JACKING APPLICATIONS INCLUDING THE MAERZENBACH HYDROPOWER SCHEME IN THE AUSTRIAN ALPS. ANOTHER RECENT DEVELOPMENT BY HERRENKNECHT COMBINES FEATURES OF PIPE JACKING WITH HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONAL DRILLING RIGS. THE PIPE THRUSTER ASSISTS THE INSTALLATION OF CONTINUOUS STEEL PIPELINES THAT, WITH CONVENTIONAL DIRECTIONAL DRILLING, WOULD RELY MAINLY ON THE PULLBACK FORCE AVAILABLE FROM THE DRILLING RIG. THE INSTALLATION OF RELATIVELY LARGE DIMENSION, OFTEN RECTANGULAR SECTION, STRUCTURES SUCH AS CULVERTS, UNDERPASSES AND SUBWAYS UNDER SURFACE OBSTRUCTIONS SUCH AS ROADS AND RAILWAYS, WHICH MAY REMAIN ACTIVE, IS SOMETHING OF A NICHE PURSUIT WITHIN THE JACKING WORLD. JACKED STRUCTURES POINTS OUT THAT JACKING CAN BE USED TO CREATE IRREGULAR OPENINGS AS WELL AS THE MORE USUAL REGULAR SECTIONS IN LARGE DIMENSIONS.	0	***

THE ALTERNATIVE BY PASS WAS DECIDED UPON BECAUSE THE EXISTING CRYSTAL SPRINGS BY PASS PIPELINE CAN BE AFFECTED BY SEISMIC ACTIVITY. IN ADDITION TO ITS CRITICAL PLACE IN THE WSIP WITH SEISMIC UPGRADING, THERE WAS ADDITIONAL MOTIVATION FOR THE MOVE TO REPLACE THE EXISTING CRYSTAL SPRINGS BYPASS PIPELINE. THE NEW TUNNEL IS 1280M LONG AND 2.44M FINISHED DIAMETER WITH A WELDED STEEL LINER, AND IS DUE FOR COMPLETION IN SPRING NEXT YEAR. THE MIX WAS DESIGNED AND PLACED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT SUPPORT FOR THE PIPE ONCE CURED, BUT TO AVOID TOO MUCH FLOTATION FORCE TENDING TO LIFT THE PIPE. ONCE TUNNELING HAD BEEN COMPLETED, INSTALLATION OF THE PIPELINE COULD BEGIN, AND AMERON INTERNATIONAL IS ASSIGNED TO FABRICATE THE WATER PIPE.	0	***

THE REINFORCING ABILITY OF A FIBER DEPENDS ON THE ANCHORAGE OF THE FIBER INTO THE CONCRETE, THE TENSILE STRENGTH AND ITS YOUNGS MODULUS. METALLIC FIBERS HAVE A NEUTRAL TO POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE FIRE RESISTANCE OF STRUCTURES. DUE TO A DECREASED SPALLING EFFECT, A STRUCTURE IN METAL FIBROUS CONCRETE BEHAVES RATHER BETTER IN THE PRESENCE OF FIRE THAN A MESH REINFORCED STRUCTURE FOR SEGMENTAL LINING, ACCORDING TO TUNNELING SPECIALISTS. EUROPEAN STANDARD 14721 SPECIFIES TWO METHODS OF MEASURING THE FIBER CONTENT OF METALLIC FIBER CONCRETE. THE TEST PLATE USUALLY USED IS DESIGNED TO DETERMINE THE ENERGY ABSORBED FROM THE LOAD/DEFLECTION CURVE. FIBER CONCRETE IS WELL KNOWN FOR ITS DUCTILITY. THE EFFECT OF FIBERS IS A COMBINATION OF REINFORCEMENT AND NETWORKING.	6	***

THE TUNNELS PROPOSED ALIGNMENT IS BASED ON FINDINGS FROM A FEASIBILITY STUDY CARRIED OUT BY GERMAN CONSULTANTS TEWET IN 2003, AND UPDATED IN 2005. THE HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT IS QUITE CONSTRAINED DUE TO LOCATIONS OF THE STATIONS WITHIN THE NARROW STREETS TYPICAL TO THE AREA, AND THE NEED TO AVOID BUILDING FOUNDATIONS. THE LINE REMAINS UNDERGROUND ON TRUONG CHINH PAST THE END OF THE TAN SON NHAT AIRPORT RUNWAYS, AND THEN SURFACES THROUGH AN OPEN CUT TRANSITION AREA OF AROUND 23OM JUST BEYOND TRUONG CHINH 1 STATION.	0	***

THE USE OF SIMPLE NUMERICAL MODELS COUPLED WITH TORSIONAL SPRINGS TO REPRESENT THE JOINT STIFFNESS WILL ASSIST DESIGNERS TO PREDICT THE RESPONSE OF EXISTING CAST IRON LININGS DURING CRITICAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES, WHEN FAILURE IS MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR. A MORE ACCURATE PREDICTION OF DISTRESS, AND WHERE AND WHEN IT IS LIKELY TO MANIFEST ITSELF, ALLOWS PROPOSALS THAT MAY HITHERTO BE CONSIDERED UNFEASIBLE CONSTRUCTIONS. THE IN SITU AXIAL LOADS PRESENT IN THE CAST IRON LINING PRIOR TO CONSTRUCTION OF NEW WORKS IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE IN THE PREDICTION OF ALLOWABLE LEVELS OF JOINT ROTATION. THE ADVANTAGE OF UNDERTAKING NUMERICAL ANALYSIS IS THAT THE ASSUMPTION OF UNIFORM ELLIPTICAL DISTORTION IS ELIMINATED; THE DISTORTED SHAPE OF THE EXISTING TUNNEL LININGS IS BETTER CAPTURED.	15	***

THIS WILL PLACE HIGHER DEMANDS ON FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEMS NEEDED TO FULFIL NOT ONLY FIRE PROTECTION AND FIRE LIFE SAFETY NEEDS BUT ALSO OFFER THE MOST ECONOMICAL AND DURABLE SOLUTIONS FOR THE GIVEN RISKS IN THE TUNNEL. NUMEROUS BODIES HAVE STARTED EXAMINING TUNNEL USER SAFETY AND METHODS OF PROTECTING THE STRUCTURE FROM FIRE. FIBER MANUFACTURERS HAVE PROMOTED MULTI AND MONOFILAMENT POLYPROPYLENE FIBERS TO CONTRACTORS AND DESIGN TEAMS. THERMAL BARRIERS ARE DESIGNED TO BE INSTALLED AS A PROTECTION TO PROTECT THE STRUCTURE FROM FIRE AT ANY TIME. THE MEYCO FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEM, MEYCO FIRESHIELD 1350, HAS RECENTLY BEEN APPLIED INSIDE THE BODIO SECTION OF THE GOTTHARD BASE TUNNEL. ALL STRUCTURES WILL NEED TO BE DESIGNED WITH CONCRETE THAT HAS LOWER WATER/CEMENT RATIOS.	5	***

THE EUROPEAN UNION TUNNEL SAFETY DIRECTIVE WAS APPROVED IN 2004 TO MEET THE REQUIRED NORMS ON KEY ROUTES BY 2014 IN MOST CASES. HEAVY GOODS TRAFFIC IS A MAIN FACTOR IN THE SAFETY RANKING OF TUNNELS EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF IDENTIFIED UNSAFE LOADS. MATERIAL SELECTION AND IDENTIFICATION OF THE PROPERTIES OF EXISTING TUNNEL STRUCTURES ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN TUNNEL REFURBISHMENT FOR SAFETY UPGRADATION. MODERN TRANSPORT TUNNEL VENTILATION AND ITS CONTROL REQUIRE TO BE INTEGRATED WITH OTHER EMERGENCY SERVICES LIKE COMMUNICATIONS AND ALARMS, SHINING SIGNAGE FOR ESCAPE ROUTES AND FIRE FIGHTING SYSTEMS. THE EKOVENT DEVELOPED 3K/SAFECONSTRUCTION SYSTEM OF TRIPLE CEILING DUCTS AND LOUVERED EXTRACTION POINTS FACILITATES INCIDENT INTERVENTION AND EXIT TO BOTH DIRECTIONS FROM THE FIRE CENTER WITHOUT REQUIRING AN ADDITIONAL ESCAPE TUNNEL.	0	***

UNLESS THE CONTRACTOR IS WILLING TO TAKE THE FULL GROUND RISK, EVERY CONTRACT HAS A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE CLAUSE TO DEFINE THE LEVEL OF GROUND RISK THE CONTRACTOR IS WILLING TO TAKE. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS APPROACH IS THAT PURCHASERS ONLY WANT TO PAY FOR WHAT ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE, RATHER THAN PAY A PREMIUM FOR A CONTINGENCY WHICH MAY NOT TAKE PLACE. MANY DISPUTES RESULT FROM MATTERS THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO CIVIL ENGINEERING ACTIVITIES. DELAY IN PROJECTS ALSO LEAD TO DISPUTES, PUTTING THE PURCHASER AT RISK OF BEING IN VIOLATION OF THIRD PARTY INTERFACE AGREEMENTS OR OTHER STATUTORY DUTIES, WITH THE RISK OF FINES UNLESS THE SCHEME CAN BE USED BEFORE COMPLETION.

CONVERSELY, SYNTHETIC FIBERS LOSE SIGNIFICANCE AS THE CONCRETE BECOMES MORE MATURE. STEEL FIBERS DO NOT CREEP AT THE LEVELS OF STRAIN IN CONCRETE, WHILE IT IS NOT SO WITH SYNTHETIC FIBERS. DURABILITY OF FIBER REINFORCED CONCRETE INVOLVES TWO ASPECTS; THE MATERIAL AND THE STRUCTURE.

FIRE DAMAGE TO THE TUNNELS SEGMENTAL LINING AND FIXED EQUIPMENT WAS CONCENTRATED ABOUT 11KM FROM THE PORTAL. THUS, OWNER AND OPERATOR EUROTUNNEL HAD SET A TARGET DATE OF MID FEBRUARY FOR THE 650M LONG DAMAGED SECTION TO BE FULLY RESTORED. IN LATE OCTOBER, THE WORK GOT STARTED TO REMOVE WEAKENED AND DAMAGED CONCRETE, CLEAR DEBRIS AND INSTALL ROCKBOLTS THEN PROCEEDED WITH RENEWED STEEL REINFORCEMENT AND THEN SHOTCRETE FILL. AS A RESULT, THE REPAIRING AND RETURNING THE DAMAGED INTERVAL TO SERVICE WAS SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED WAY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.	0	***

THIS FAMILY OF TECHNIQUES THAT INCLUDE PIPE BURSTING, PIPE EATING, AND PIPE REAMING HAVE BEEN REVIEWED. THE PIPE BURSTING TECHNIQUE WAS LARGELY BASED AROUND THE USE OF HAMMERS. ALTHOUGH EFFECTIVE, IT HAS ALSO CERTAIN DRAWBACKS SUCH AS PIPE MATERIAL HAS TO BE RELATIVELY EASY TO FRACTURE. MEANWHILE, OTHER TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS TO FACILITATE THE REPLACEMENT OF PIPELINES. ONE OF THE TECHNIQUE WAS PIPE EATING THAT USES MICROTUNNELLING TECHNIQUES. FURTHERMORE, THAT MICROTUNNELLING HAS SEEN ADAPTATION FOR USE IN THE PIPE REPLACEMENT SECTOR, SO HAS HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONAL DRILLING (HDD). THE HDD RIGS ARE SET UP AT AN ACCESS POINT ATONE END OF THE PIPE BEING REPLACED, THE DRILL IS PLAYED OUT THROUGH THE EXISTING PIPE.	0	***

THE NEW DRIVERLESS SUBWAY LINE WILL BE THE LONGEST IN EUROPE WHEN COMPLETED, WITH AN OVERALL LENGTH OF OVER 44KM. IT WILL RUN ACROSS THE CITY CONNECTING BADALONA AND SANTA COLOMA DE GRAMANET, WITH ZONA FRANCE AND THE AIRPORT, TO THE SOUTH WEST. BASED ON THE TYPOLOGY OF THE GROUND, THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE LINE IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR SECTIONS WHICH INVOLVE THE USE OF FOUR TUNNEL BORING MACHINES (TBMS). THE TUNNEL LINING IS CONSISTED OF PRE CAST CONCRETE SEGMENTS. A DEEP TUNNEL ALIGNMENT WAS SELECTED TO ALLOW THE ALIGNMENT TO PASS BELOW EXISTING UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO REDUCE THE RISK OF SURFACE SETTLEMENT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. A SINGLE LARGE TUNNEL WITH A DOUBLE DECK RAIL TRACK CONFIGURATION HAS BEEN SELECTED FOR THE LINE TO ALLOW STATION PLATFORMS TO BE LOCATED WITHIN THE RUNNING TUNNEL ITSELF, LIMITING THE SURFACE DISRUPTION TO ACCESS SHAFTS IN HIGHLY CONGESTED AREAS.	2	***

ARBITRATION IS ALSO MORE ADVANTAGEOUS THAN LITIGATION IN THAT IT HAS MORE CONTROL ON THE PARTY OVER THE PROCEEDINGS. WITH THIS, ONE PARTY HAS THE OPTION TO CHOOSE A SUBJECT MATTER SPECIALIST ARBITRATOR. LOOKING ON THE POSITIVE SIDE OF IT, MOST JURISDICTIONS IN THE WORLD AGREES ON HAVING AN ARBITRATION TO SETTLE SUCH DISPUTE RATHER THAN RUNNING IT THROUGH A LITIGATION. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT HAS TERMINOLOGY THAT IS USEFUL THAT IT CAN BE INSERTED INTO A CONTRACT AT THE OUTSET. THERE ARE FOUR LAYERS OF CONTROL WITHIN THE CONDUCT OF ARBITRATION WHICH INCLUDE THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, STANDARD RULES, CONTROL BY ARBITRATION AND THE ARBITRATION LAW OF THE JURISDICTION.	0	***

GROUT FORMING WILL BE DONE WITHIN MOST OF THE GROUND IMPROVEMENT WORKS OVER THE ALIGNMENTS OF THE NEW FOOT TUNNELS OR PAID AREA LINK (PAL) WITH SOME REGULAR CUT OFF WALLS. THE SOLUTION TO THE CONGESTION IS TO ADD ADDITIONAL ACCESS TO THE VICTORIA TUBE PLATFORM FROM THE NORTHERN END. PAL TUNNELS WILL BE PLACED AT A LEVEL HIGHER THAN THAT OF VICTORIA LINE STATION AND LONDON CLAY FOR SEVERAL REASONS. THE NUMBER OF TUBE TICKET HALLS AT VICTORIA WILL INCREASE DUE TO THIS RELIEF WORKS WHILE SECANT PILE CONSTRUCTION WILL BE USED TO BUILD THE BOX STATIONS IN STAGES AT BOTH LOCATIONS. HOWEVER, RIVER TERRACE DEPOSITS APPEARS TO BE OF CONCERN FOR THE TUNNEL WORKS AND FOR THE CUT AND COVER BOXES. DEWATERING WILL BE USED FOR GROUND TREATMENT WHEREAS THE DIMENSIONS OF MOST OF THE PAL TUNNELS EXCAVATION WILL BE 6M HIGH AND 5.5M WIDE. A COMBINATION OF SHOTCRETE, MESH AND LATTICE ARCHES WILL BE LINED TO THE BENCHED EXCAVATION. FINALLY, A DESIGN TEAM WILL MAKE SURE OF THE CONSTRUCTABILITY OF THE TUNNELS.	0	***

SOLUTIONS FOR CONVERGENCY COMPATIBLE SYSTEMS IN TUNNELS DRIVEN BY SHIELDED TBMS WITH SUBSEQUENT SEGMENTAL LINING ARE STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT. ONE SOLUTION THE INSTALLATION OF DEFORMABLE ELEMENTS IN THE LONGITUDINAL JOINTS IS UNLIKELY TO MAKE ITS WAY FROM USE IN CONVENTIONAL TUNNELLING INTO MECHANISED TUNNELLING. OF THE TWO OTHER REMAINING SOLUTIONS RIBBED SEGMENT WITH RECESS, OR COMPRESSIBLE FILLING OF THE ANNULAR GAP THE LATTER IS THE MORE PROMISING ONE. ITS APPLICATION WILL FACILITATE TUNNEL DRIVING BY TBM THROUGH SECTIONS OF SQUEEZING ROCK. SINCE THIS METHOD PROVIDES HIGHER ADVANCE RATES THAN CONVENTIONAL METHODS OF EXCAVATION AND SUPPORT ITS APPLICATION WILL SAVE COST AND TIME. FOR HUGE PROJECTS LIKE THE ALPINE BASE TUNNELS IN AUSTRIA, ITALY AND FRANCE AND TUNNELS IN JURASSIC FORMATIONS THIS COULD BE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE.	11	***

THE POWER STATION OWNERS, APPLIED ENERGY SERVICES (AES) KILROOT LTD, AND THE KILROOT POWER STATION MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT APPROACHED DYNO ROD (NI), BASED IN BELFAST, TO AIDE THE PIPELINES RENOVATION THAT WAS RELINING. DYNO ROD EMPLOYED THE ULTRAVIOLET (UV) LIGHT CURED LIGHT SYSTEM AT THE POWER STATION. ASIDE FROM QUICK, EASY INSTALLATION, THE USE OF UV LINING ALSO IMPROVED ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS WITH REDUCED STYRENE EMISSIONS AS WELL AS LESS DISRUPTION TO TRAFFIC IN THE WIDER WORLD AND IN GOING OPERATIONS.	0	***

THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE KOPS II SCHEME IS BEHALF OF POWER PRODUCER CLIENT VORARLBERGER ILLWERKE, IN THE MONTAFON VALLEY. FROM NOVEMBER 2004 AND DECEMBER 2005, A TOTAL VOLUME OF 125,000M 3 WAS EXCAVATED FORMING THE POWERHOUSE AND TRANSFORMER CAVERNS AND THE EXCAVATION OF ASSOCIATED TUNNELS AND SHAFTS WERE ALSO PERFORMED THAT AMOUNTS TO A TOTAL OF 78,000M 3. ALL PARTS OF THE KOPS IIPROJECT ARE BUILT WITHIN THE SILVERETTA CRYSTALLINE ROCK SERIES THAT CONSISTS MAINLY OF SOLID, HARD STRATA. THE KOPS II WAS THE FIRST PROJECT IN VORARLBERG THAT REQUIRED AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (EIA) IN IDENTIFYING AND EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE SCHEME AND LOOK AT POSSIBLE MITIGATION MEASURES. OVER THE PERIOD OF 18 MONTHS, ABOUT 48,000M 3 OF CONCRETE WAS CAST WITHIN THE CAVERNS, CONCURRENT WITH A VARIETY OF LINING AND BACKFILLING WORKS IN THE TUNNELS, SHAFTS, AND OTHER AUXILIARY STRUCTURES.	0	***	
	GRRRU	PEILA,D								DEPARTMENT OF LAND,ITALY								MICROTUNNELLING VS OPEN TRENCH	2008	TUNNELS AND TUNNELLING INTERNATIONAL		FEB.	1							1	PEILA,D	IN EVALUATING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MICROTUNNELING AND OPEN TRENCH EXCAVATION FOR AN INFRASTRUCTURE INSTALLATION PROJECT IN AN URBAN AREA, IT CAN BE PERFORMED WITH THE USE OF THE ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS (AHP). IT IS ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY USED MULTI CRITERIA TECHNIQUES AVAILABLE AND CAN ASSIST IN PROVIDING A QUANTITATIVE COMPARISON AMONG THE CONSIDERED OPTIONS. THE AHP ARE SUITABLE FOR A COMPLEX AND MULTI DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS. THE COMPARISON TRENCH EXCAVATION AND MICROTUNNELING CONDUCTED IN THIS ANALYSIS, IT IS SHOWED THAT IF INDIRECT CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE CONSIDERED, MICROTUNNELING IS PREFERABLE TO TRADITIONAL TRENCH EXCAVATION.	12	***
